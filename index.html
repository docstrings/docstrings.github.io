<h3>Function: kinsoku</h3>
Go to a line breaking position near point by doing `kinsoku' processing.
LINEBEG is a buffer position we can't break a line before.</p>
<p>
`Kinsoku' processing is to prohibit specific characters to be placed
at beginning of line or at end of line.  Characters not to be placed
at beginning and end of line have character category `>' and `<'
respectively.  This restriction is dissolved by making a line longer or
shorter.</p>
<p>
`Kinsoku' is a Japanese word which originally means ordering to stay
in one place, and is used for the text processing described above in
the context of text formatting.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: universal-argument</h3>
Begin a numeric argument for the following command.
Digits or minus sign following C-u make up the numeric argument.
C-u following the digits or minus sign ends the argument.
C-u without digits or minus sign provides 4 as argument.
Repeating C-u without digits or minus sign
 multiplies the argument by 4 each time.
For some commands, just C-u by itself serves as a flag
which is different in effect from any particular numeric argument.
These commands include C-SPC and M-x start-kbd-macro.<a name="set-standard-case-table"></a>

Generate and print a PostScript image of the region.
Like `ps-print-region', but includes font, color, and underline information in
the generated image.  This command works only if you are using a window system,
so it has a way to determine color values.</p>
<p>
(fn FROM TO &optional FILENAME)<a name="window-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: window-buffer</h3>
Return the buffer displayed in window WINDOW.
If WINDOW is omitted or nil, it defaults to the selected window.

(fn)<a name="compare-strings"></a>
<h3>Function: compare-strings</h3>
Compare the contents of two strings, converting to multibyte if needed.
The arguments START1, END1, START2, and END2, if non-nil, are
positions specifying which parts of STR1 or STR2 to compare.  In
string STR1, compare the part between START1 (inclusive) and END1
(exclusive).  If START1 is nil, it defaults to 0, the beginning of
the string; if END1 is nil, it defaults to the length of the string.
Likewise, in string STR2, compare the part between START2 and END2.</p>
<p>
The strings are compared by the numeric values of their characters.
For instance, STR1 is "less than" STR2 if its first differing
character has a smaller numeric value.  If IGNORE-CASE is non-nil,
characters are converted to lower-case before comparing them.  Unibyte
strings are converted to multibyte for comparison.</p>
<p>
The value is t if the strings (or specified portions) match.
If string STR1 is less, the value is a negative number N;
  - 1 - N is the number of characters that match at the beginning.
If string STR1 is greater, the value is a positive number N;
  N - 1 is the number of characters that match at the beginning.</p>
<p>
(fn STR1 START1 END1 STR2 START2 END2 &optional IGNORE-CASE)<a name="widget-leave-text"></a>

<h3>Function: process-file</h3>
Process files synchronously in a separate process.
Similar to `call-process', but may invoke a file handler based on
`default-directory'.  The current working directory of the
subprocess is `default-directory'.</p>
<p>
File names in INFILE and BUFFER are handled normally, but file
names in ARGS should be relative to `default-directory', as they
are passed to the process verbatim.  (This is a difference to
`call-process' which does not support file handlers for INFILE
and BUFFER.)</p>
<p>
Some file handlers might not support all variants, for example
they might behave as if DISPLAY was nil, regardless of the actual
value passed.<a name="custom-notify"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-notify</h3>
Keep track of changes.<a name="url-http-chunked-encoding-after-change-function"></a>
<h3>Function: url-http-chunked-encoding-after-change-function</h3>

Cannot give a sophisticated percentage, but we need a different
function to look for the special 0-length chunk that signifies
the end of the document.<a name="define-key"></a>
<h3>Function: define-key</h3>
In KEYMAP, define key sequence KEY as DEF.
KEYMAP is a keymap.</p>
<p>
KEY is a string or a vector of symbols and characters, representing a
sequence of keystrokes and events.  Non-ASCII characters with codes
above 127 (such as ISO Latin-1) can be represented by vectors.
Two types of vector have special meanings:
 [remap COMMAND] remaps any key binding for COMMAND.
 [t] creates a default definition, which applies to any event with no
    other definition in KEYMAP.</p>
<p>
DEF is anything that can be a key's definition:
 nil (means key is undefined in this keymap),
 a command (a Lisp function suitable for interactive calling),
 a string (treated as a keyboard macro),
 a keymap (to define a prefix key),
 a symbol (when the key is looked up, the symbol will stand for its
    function definition, which should at that time be one of the above,
    or another symbol whose function definition is used, etc.),
 a cons (STRING . DEFN), meaning that DEFN is the definition
    (DEFN should be a valid definition in its own right),
 or a cons (MAP . CHAR), meaning use definition of CHAR in keymap MAP,
 or an extended menu item definition.
 (See info node `(elisp)Extended Menu Items'.)</p>
<p>
If KEYMAP is a sparse keymap with a binding for KEY, the existing
binding is altered.  If there is no binding for KEY, the new pair
binding KEY to DEF is added at the front of KEYMAP.</p>
<p>
(fn KEYMAP KEY DEF)<a name="server-unquote-arg"></a>

Toggle automatic refilling (Refill mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Refill mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Refill mode is a buffer-local minor mode.  When enabled, the
current paragraph is refilled as you edit.  Self-inserting
characters only cause refilling if they would cause
auto-filling.</p>
<p>
For true "word wrap" behavior, use `visual-line-mode' instead.</p>

FRAME defaults to the selected frame.
Each element of the returned alist is of the form:
 (NAME INDEX R G B)
where NAME is the name of the color, a string;
INDEX is the index of this color to be sent to the terminal driver
when the color should be displayed; it is typically a small integer;
R, G, and B are the intensities of, accordingly, red, green, and blue
components of the color, represented as numbers between 0 and 65535.
The file `etc/rgb.txt' in the Emacs distribution lists the standard
RGB values of the X colors.  If RGB is nil, this color will not be
considered by `tty-color-translate' as an approximation to another
color.<a name="flycheck-register-config-file-var"></a>

<h3>Function: edmacro-mode</h3>
Keyboard Macro Editing mode.  Press C-c C-c to save and exit.
To abort the edit, just kill this buffer with C-x k RET.</p>
<p>
Press C-c C-q to insert the name of any key by typing the key.</p>
<p>
The editing buffer contains a "Command:" line and any number of
"Key:" lines at the top.  These are followed by a "Macro:" line
and the macro itself as spelled-out keystrokes: `C-x C-f foo RET'.</p>
<p>
The "Command:" line specifies the command name to which the macro
is bound, or "none" for no command name.  Write "last-kbd-macro"
to refer to the current keyboard macro (as used by M-x call-last-kbd-macro).</p>
<p>
The "Key:" lines specify key sequences to which the macro is bound,
or "none" for no key bindings.</p>
<p>
You can edit these lines to change the places where the new macro
is stored.</p>
<p>

Format of keyboard macros during editing:</p>
<p>
Text is divided into "words" separated by whitespace.  Except for
the words described below, the characters of each word go directly
as characters of the macro.  The whitespace that separates words
is ignored.  Whitespace in the macro must be written explicitly,
as in "foo SPC bar RET".</p>
<p>
 * The special words RET, SPC, TAB, DEL, LFD, ESC, and NUL represent
   special control characters.  The words must be written in uppercase.</p>
<p>
 * A word in angle brackets, e.g., <return>, <down>, or <f1>, represents
   a function key.  (Note that in the standard configuration, the
   function key <return> and the control key RET are synonymous.)
   You can use angle brackets on the words RET, SPC, etc., but they
   are not required there.</p>
<p>
 * Keys can be written by their ASCII code, using a backslash followed
   by up to six octal digits.  This is the only way to represent keys
   with codes above \377.</p>
<p>
 * One or more prefixes M- (meta), C- (control), S- (shift), A- (alt),
   H- (hyper), and s- (super) may precede a character or key notation.
   For function keys, the prefixes may go inside or outside of the
   brackets:  C-<down> = <C-down>.  The prefixes may be written in
   any order:  M-C-x = C-M-x.</p>
<p>
   Prefixes are not allowed on multi-key words, e.g., C-abc, except
   that the Meta prefix is allowed on a sequence of digits and optional
   minus sign:  M--123 = M-- M-1 M-2 M-3.</p>
<p>
 * The `^' notation for control characters also works:  ^M = C-m.</p>
<p>
 * Double angle brackets enclose command names:  <<next-line>> is
   shorthand for M-x next-line RET.</p>
<p>
 * Finally, REM or ;; causes the rest of the line to be ignored as a
   comment.</p>
<p>
Any word may be prefixed by a multiplier in the form of a decimal
number and `*':  3*<right> = <right> <right> <right>, and
10*foo = foofoofoofoofoofoofoofoofoofoo.</p>
<p>
Multiple text keys can normally be strung together to form a word,
but you may need to add whitespace if the word would look like one
of the above notations:  `; ; ;' is a keyboard macro with three
semicolons, but `;;;' is a comment.  Likewise, `\ 1 2 3' is four
keys but `\123' is a single key written in octal, and `< right >'
is seven keys but `<right>' is a single function key.  When in
doubt, use whitespace.<a name="cl-gcd"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-gcd</h3>
Return the greatest common divisor of the arguments.</p>
<p>
(fn &rest ARGS)<a name="x-dnd-default-test-function"></a>
<h3>Function: x-dnd-default-test-function</h3>
The default test function for drag and drop.
WINDOW is where the mouse is when this function is called.  It may be
a frame if the mouse is over the menu bar, scroll bar or tool bar.
ACTION is the suggested action from the source, and TYPES are the
types the drop data can have.  This function only accepts drops with
types in `x-dnd-known-types'.  It always returns the action private.<a name="mouse-scroll-subr"></a>
<h3>Function: mouse-scroll-subr</h3>
Scroll the window WINDOW, JUMP lines at a time, until new input arrives.
If OVERLAY is an overlay, let it stretch from START to the far edge of

<h3>Function: coding-system-category</h3>
Return a category symbol of CODING-SYSTEM.<a name="pos-visible-in-window-p"></a>
<h3>Function: pos-visible-in-window-p</h3>
Return non-nil if position POS is currently on the frame in WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
Return nil if that position is scrolled vertically out of view.  If a
character is only partially visible, nil is returned, unless the
optional argument PARTIALLY is non-nil.  If POS is only out of view
because of horizontal scrolling, return non-nil.  If POS is t, it
specifies the position of the last visible glyph in WINDOW.  POS
defaults to point in WINDOW; WINDOW defaults to the selected window.</p>
<p>
If POS is visible, return t if PARTIALLY is nil; if PARTIALLY is non-nil,
return value is a list of 2 or 6 elements (X Y [RTOP RBOT ROWH VPOS]),
where X and Y are the pixel coordinates relative to the top left corner
of the window.  The remaining elements are omitted if the character after
POS is fully visible; otherwise, RTOP and RBOT are the number of pixels
off-window at the top and bottom of the row, ROWH is the height of the
display row, and VPOS is the row number (0-based) containing POS.</p>

<h3>Function: format-property-increment-region</h3>
In the region from FROM to TO increment property PROP by amount DELTA.
DELTA may be negative.  If property PROP is nil anywhere
in the region, it is treated as though it were DEFAULT.<a name="face-attribute"></a>
<h3>Function: face-attribute</h3>
Return the value of FACE's ATTRIBUTE on FRAME.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.</p>
<p>
If INHERIT is nil, only attributes directly defined by FACE are considered,
  so the return value may be `unspecified', or a relative value.
If INHERIT is non-nil, FACE's definition of ATTRIBUTE is merged with the
  faces specified by its `:inherit' attribute; however the return value
  may still be `unspecified' or relative.
If INHERIT is a face or a list of faces, then the result is further merged
  with that face (or faces), until it becomes specified and absolute.</p>
<p>
To ensure that the return value is always specified and absolute, use a
value of `default' for INHERIT; this will resolve any unspecified or
relative values by merging with the `default' face (which is always
completely specified).<a name="internal-show-cursor-p"></a>

INDEX is based from the current processing position.  If INDEX is
positive, values returned are closer to the command argument; if
negative, they are closer to the last argument.  If the INDEX is
outside of the argument list, nil is returned.  The default value for

<h3>Function: mixal-mode</h3>

<p>
(fn)<a name="prepare-change-group"></a>
<h3>Function: prepare-change-group</h3>
Return a handle for the current buffer's state, for a change group.
If you specify BUFFER, make a handle for BUFFER's state instead.</p>
<p>
Pass the handle to `activate-change-group' afterward to initiate
the actual changes of the change group.</p>
<p>
To finish the change group, call either `accept-change-group' or
`cancel-change-group' passing the same handle as argument.  Call
`accept-change-group' to accept the changes in the group as final;
call `cancel-change-group' to undo them all.  You should use
`unwind-protect' to make sure the group is always finished.  The call
to `activate-change-group' should be inside the `unwind-protect'.
Once you finish the group, don't use the handle again--don't try to
finish the same group twice.  For a simple example of correct use, see
the source code of `atomic-change-group'.</p>
<p>
The handle records only the specified buffer.  To make a multibuffer
change group, call this function once for each buffer you want to
cover, then use `nconc' to combine the returned values, like this:</p>
<p>
  (nconc (prepare-change-group buffer-1)
         (prepare-change-group buffer-2))</p>
<p>
You can then activate that multibuffer change group with a single
call to `activate-change-group' and finish it with a single call
to `accept-change-group' or `cancel-change-group'.<a name="run-hook-with-args-until-success"></a>
<h3>Function: run-hook-with-args-until-success</h3>
Run HOOK with the specified arguments ARGS.
HOOK should be a symbol, a hook variable.  The value of HOOK
may be nil, a function, or a list of functions.  Call each
function in order with arguments ARGS, stopping at the first
one that returns non-nil, and return that value.  Otherwise (if
all functions return nil, or if there are no functions to call),
return nil.</p>
<p>
Do not use `make-local-variable' to make a hook variable buffer-local.
Instead, use `add-hook' and specify t for the LOCAL argument.</p>
<p>
(fn HOOK &rest ARGS)<a name="define-abbrev"></a>
<h3>Function: define-abbrev</h3>
Define an abbrev in TABLE named NAME, to expand to EXPANSION and call HOOK.
NAME must be a string, and should be lower-case.
EXPANSION should usually be a string.
To undefine an abbrev, define it with EXPANSION = nil.
If HOOK is non-nil, it should be a function of no arguments;
it is called after EXPANSION is inserted.
If EXPANSION is not a string (and not nil), the abbrev is a
 special one, which does not expand in the usual way but only
 runs HOOK.</p>
<p>
If HOOK is a non-nil symbol with a non-nil `no-self-insert' property,
it can control whether the character that triggered abbrev expansion
is inserted.  If such a HOOK returns non-nil, the character is not
inserted.  If such a HOOK returns nil, then so does `abbrev-insert'
(and `expand-abbrev'), as if no abbrev expansion had taken place.</p>
<p>
PROPS is a property list.  The following properties are special:
- `:count': the value for the abbrev's usage-count, which is incremented each
  time the abbrev is used (the default is zero).
- `:system': if non-nil, says that this is a "system" abbreviation
  which should not be saved in the user's abbreviation file.
  Unless `:system' is `force', a system abbreviation will not
  overwrite a non-system abbreviation of the same name.
- `:case-fixed': non-nil means that abbreviations are looked up without
  case-folding, and the expansion is not capitalized/upcased.
- `:enable-function': a function of no argument which returns non-nil if the
  abbrev should be used for a particular call of `expand-abbrev'.</p>

<h3>Function: calendar-hebrew-list-yahrzeits</h3>
List Yahrzeit dates for *Gregorian* DEATH-DATE from START-YEAR to END-YEAR.
When called interactively from the calendar window, the date of death is taken
from the cursor position.</p>
<p>
(fn DEATH-DATE START-YEAR END-YEAR)<a name="narrow-to-region"></a>
<h3>Function: narrow-to-region</h3>
Restrict editing in this buffer to the current region.
The rest of the text becomes temporarily invisible and untouchable
but is not deleted; if you save the buffer in a file, the invisible
text is included in the file.  C-x n w makes all visible again.
See also `save-restriction'.</p>

Return a string representing the end of today's workday.
This string is relative to the value of `timeclock-workday'.  If
SHOW-SECONDS is non-nil, the value printed/returned will include
seconds.  If TODAY-ONLY is non-nil, the value returned will be
relative only to the time worked today, and not to past time.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional SHOW-SECONDS TODAY-ONLY)<a name="display-buffer-in-side-window"></a>
<h3>Function: display-buffer-in-side-window</h3>
Display BUFFER in a window on side SIDE of the selected frame.
ALIST is an association list of symbols and values.  The
following symbols can be used:</p>
<p>
`side' denotes the side of the existing window where the new
  window shall be located.  Valid values are `bottom', `right',
  `top' and `left'.  The default is `bottom'.</p>
<p>
`slot' if non-nil, specifies the window slot where to display
  BUFFER.  A value of zero or nil means use the middle slot on
  the specified side.  A negative value means use a slot
  preceding (that is, above or on the left of) the middle slot.
  A positive value means use a slot following (that is, below or
  on the right of) the middle slot.  The default is zero.<a name="jit-lock-register"></a>
<h3>Function: jit-lock-register</h3>
Register FUN as a fontification function to be called in this buffer.
FUN will be called with two arguments START and END indicating the region
that needs to be (re)fontified.
If non-nil, CONTEXTUAL means that a contextual fontification would be useful.<a name="set-buffer-multibyte"></a>
<h3>Function: set-buffer-multibyte</h3>
Set the multibyte flag of the current buffer to FLAG.
If FLAG is t, this makes the buffer a multibyte buffer.
If FLAG is nil, this makes the buffer a single-byte buffer.
In these cases, the buffer contents remain unchanged as a sequence of
bytes but the contents viewed as characters do change.
If FLAG is `to', this makes the buffer a multibyte buffer by changing
all eight-bit bytes to eight-bit characters.
If the multibyte flag was really changed, undo information of the
current buffer is cleared.</p>
<p>
(fn FLAG)<a name="make-indirect-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: make-indirect-buffer</h3>
Create and return an indirect buffer for buffer BASE-BUFFER, named NAME.
BASE-BUFFER should be a live buffer, or the name of an existing buffer.
NAME should be a string which is not the name of an existing buffer.
Optional argument CLONE non-nil means preserve BASE-BUFFER's state,
such as major and minor modes, in the indirect buffer.
CLONE nil means the indirect buffer's state is reset to default values.</p>
<p>
(fn BASE-BUFFER NAME &optional CLONE)<a name="global-visual-line-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: global-visual-line-mode</h3>

This includes new user options and faces, and new customization
groups, as well as older options and faces whose meanings or
default values have changed since the previous major Emacs
release.</p>
<p>
With argument SINCE-VERSION (a string), customize all settings
that were added or redefined since that version.<a name="other-window"></a>
<h3>Function: other-window</h3>
Select another window in cyclic ordering of windows.
COUNT specifies the number of windows to skip, starting with the
selected window, before making the selection.  If COUNT is
positive, skip COUNT windows forwards.  If COUNT is negative,
skip -COUNT windows backwards.  COUNT zero means do not skip any
window, so select the selected window.  In an interactive call,
COUNT is the numeric prefix argument.  Return nil.</p>
<p>
If the `other-window' parameter of the selected window is a
function and `ignore-window-parameters' is nil, call that
function with the arguments COUNT and ALL-FRAMES.</p>
<p>
This function does not select a window whose `no-other-window'
window parameter is non-nil.</p>
<p>
This function uses `next-window' for finding the window to
select.  The argument ALL-FRAMES has the same meaning as in
`next-window', but the MINIBUF argument of `next-window' is
always effectively nil.<a name="flycheck-mode-line-status-text"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-mode-line-status-text</h3>
Get a text describing STATUS for use in the mode line.</p>
<p>
STATUS defaults to `flycheck-last-status-change' if omitted or
nil.<a name="gnus-put-text-property-excluding-characters-with-faces"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-put-text-property-excluding-characters-with-faces</h3>
The same as `put-text-property', but don't put props on characters with the `gnus-face' property.<a name="cl-mapc"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-mapc</h3>
Like `cl-mapcar', but does not accumulate values returned by the function.</p>
<p>
(fn FUNCTION SEQUENCE...)<a name="vc-registered"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-registered</h3>
Return non-nil if FILE is registered in a version control system.</p>
<p>
This function performs the check each time it is called.  To rely
on the result of a previous call, use `vc-backend' instead.  If the
file was previously registered under a certain backend, then that
backend is tried first.<a name="electric-buffer-list"></a>
<h3>Function: electric-buffer-list</h3>
Pop up the Buffer Menu in an "electric" window.
If you type SPC or RET (`Electric-buffer-menu-select'), that
selects the buffer at point and quits the "electric" window.
Otherwise, you can move around in the Buffer Menu, marking
buffers to be selected, saved or deleted; these other commands
are much like those of `Buffer-menu-mode'.</p>
<p>
Run hooks in `electric-buffer-menu-mode-hook' on entry.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `electric-buffer-menu-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
C-g or M-x Electric-buffer-menu-quit -- exit buffer menu, returning to previous window and buffer
  configuration.  If the very first character typed is a space, it
  also has this effect.
M-x Electric-buffer-menu-select -- select buffer of line point is on.
  Also show buffers marked with m in other windows,
  deletes buffers marked with "D", and saves those marked with "S".
M-x Buffer-menu-mark -- mark buffer to be displayed.
M-x Buffer-menu-not-modified -- clear modified-flag on that buffer.
M-x Buffer-menu-save -- mark that buffer to be saved.
M-x Buffer-menu-delete or M-x Buffer-menu-delete-backwards -- mark that buffer to be deleted.
M-x Buffer-menu-unmark -- remove all kinds of marks from current line.
M-x Electric-buffer-menu-mode-view-buffer -- view buffer, returning when done.
M-x Buffer-menu-backup-unmark -- back up a line and remove marks.</p>
<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="window-with-parameter"></a>
<h3>Function: window-with-parameter</h3>
Return first window on FRAME with PARAMETER non-nil.
FRAME defaults to the selected frame.  Optional argument VALUE
non-nil means only return a window whose window-parameter value
for PARAMETER equals VALUE (comparison is done with `equal').
Optional argument ANY non-nil means consider internal windows
too.</p>
<p>
Optional argument MINIBUF t means consider FRAME's minibuffer
window even if it isn't active.  MINIBUF nil or omitted means
consider FRAME's minibuffer window only if it's active.  In both
cases the minibuffer window must be part of FRAME.  MINIBUF
neither nil nor t means never consider the minibuffer window.<a name="record-window-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: record-window-buffer</h3>
Record WINDOW's buffer.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.<a name="suspend-tty"></a>
<h3>Function: suspend-tty</h3>
Suspend the terminal device TTY.</p>
<p>
The device is restored to its default state, and Emacs ceases all
access to the tty device.  Frames that use the device are not deleted,
but input is not read from them and if they change, their display is
not updated.</p>
<p>
TTY may be a terminal object, a frame, or nil for the terminal device
of the currently selected frame.</p>
<p>
This function runs `suspend-tty-functions' after suspending the
device.  The functions are run with one arg, the id of the suspended
terminal device.</p>
<p>
`suspend-tty' does nothing if it is called on a device that is already
suspended.</p>
<p>
A suspended tty may be resumed by calling `resume-tty' on it.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional TTY)<a name="erc-ezb-end-of-session-list"></a>

<p>
See `ebnf-style-database' documentation.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional STYLE)<a name="auto-insert-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: auto-insert-mode</h3>
Toggle Auto-insert mode, a global minor mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Auto-insert mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When Auto-insert mode is enabled, when new files are created you can
insert a template for the file depending on the mode of the buffer.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="preceding-char"></a>
<h3>Function: preceding-char</h3>

<h3>Function: canlock-verify</h3>
Verify Cancel-Lock or Cancel-Key in BUFFER.
If BUFFER is nil, the current buffer is assumed.  Signal an error if
it fails.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional BUFFER)<a name="split-window-sensibly"></a>
<h3>Function: split-window-sensibly</h3>
Split WINDOW in a way suitable for `display-buffer'.
WINDOW defaults to the currently selected window.
If `split-height-threshold' specifies an integer, WINDOW is at
least `split-height-threshold' lines tall and can be split
vertically, split WINDOW into two windows one above the other and
return the lower window.  Otherwise, if `split-width-threshold'
specifies an integer, WINDOW is at least `split-width-threshold'
columns wide and can be split horizontally, split WINDOW into two
windows side by side and return the window on the right.  If this
can't be done either and WINDOW is the only window on its frame,
try to split WINDOW vertically disregarding any value specified
by `split-height-threshold'.  If that succeeds, return the lower
window.  Return nil otherwise.</p>
<p>
By default `display-buffer' routines call this function to split
the largest or least recently used window.  To change the default
customize the option `split-window-preferred-function'.</p>
<p>
You can enforce this function to not split WINDOW horizontally,
by setting (or binding) the variable `split-width-threshold' to
nil.  If, in addition, you set `split-height-threshold' to zero,
chances increase that this function does split WINDOW vertically.</p>
<p>
In order to not split WINDOW vertically, set (or bind) the
variable `split-height-threshold' to nil.  Additionally, you can
set `split-width-threshold' to zero to make a horizontal split
more likely to occur.</p>
<p>
Have a look at the function `window-splittable-p' if you want to
know how `split-window-sensibly' determines whether WINDOW can be
split.<a name="buffer-file-name"></a>

<h3>Function: comint-replace-by-expanded-history</h3>
Expand input command history references before point.
Expansion is dependent on the value of `comint-input-autoexpand'.</p>
<p>
This function depends on the buffer's idea of the input history, which may not
match the command interpreter's idea, assuming it has one.</p>
<p>
Assumes history syntax is like typical Un*x shells'.  However, since Emacs
cannot know the interpreter's idea of input line numbers, assuming it has one,
it cannot expand absolute input line number references.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument SILENT is non-nil, never complain
even if history reference seems erroneous.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument START is non-nil, that specifies the
start of the text to scan for history references, rather

the rules are directory inserted at point.  Otherwise, a *Help* buffer
is shown with the rules which are also put into the `kill-ring' for
C-y.</p>
<p>
This command considers import/export vocabularies and grammar
inheritance and provides a value for the "-glib" option if necessary.
Customize variable `antlr-makefile-specification' for the appearance of
the rules.</p>
<p>
If the file for a super-grammar cannot be determined, special file names
are used according to variable `antlr-unknown-file-formats' and a
commentary with value `antlr-help-unknown-file-text' is added.  The
*Help* buffer always starts with the text in `antlr-help-rules-intro'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="set-keyboard-coding-system"></a>
<h3>Function: set-keyboard-coding-system</h3>
Set coding system for keyboard input on TERMINAL to CODING-SYSTEM.</p>
<p>
For a list of possible values of CODING-SYSTEM, use M-x list-coding-systems.
The default is determined by the selected language environment
or by the previous use of this command.</p>
<p>
If CODING-SYSTEM is nil or the coding-type of CODING-SYSTEM is
`raw-text', the decoding of keyboard input is disabled.</p>
<p>
TERMINAL may be a terminal object, a frame, or nil for the
selected frame's terminal.  The setting has no effect on
graphical terminals.<a name="oddp"></a>
<h3>Function: oddp</h3>
Return t if INTEGER is odd.</p>
<p>
(fn INTEGER)<a name="clone-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: clone-buffer</h3>
Create and return a twin copy of the current buffer.
Unlike an indirect buffer, the new buffer can be edited
independently of the old one (if it is not read-only).
NEWNAME is the name of the new buffer.  It may be modified by
adding or incrementing <N> at the end as necessary to create a
unique buffer name.  If nil, it defaults to the name of the
current buffer, with the proper suffix.  If DISPLAY-FLAG is
non-nil, the new buffer is shown with `pop-to-buffer'.  Trying to
clone a file-visiting buffer, or a buffer whose major mode symbol
has a non-nil `no-clone' property, results in an error.</p>
<p>
Interactively, DISPLAY-FLAG is t and NEWNAME is the name of the
current buffer with appropriate suffix.  However, if a prefix
argument is given, then the command prompts for NEWNAME in the
minibuffer.</p>
<p>
This runs the normal hook `clone-buffer-hook' in the new buffer
after it has been set up properly in other respects.<a name="tq-create"></a>
<h3>Function: tq-create</h3>
Create and return a transaction queue communicating with PROCESS.
PROCESS should be a subprocess capable of sending and receiving
streams of bytes.  It may be a local process, or it may be connected
to a tcp server on another machine.</p>
<p>
(fn PROCESS)<a name="profiler-find-profile-other-window"></a>
<h3>Function: profiler-find-profile-other-window</h3>
Open profile FILENAME.</p>
<p>
(fn FILENAME)<a name="lock-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: lock-buffer</h3>
Lock FILE, if current buffer is modified.
FILE defaults to current buffer's visited file,
or else nothing is done if current buffer isn't visiting a file.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FILE)<a name="seq--elt-safe"></a>
<h3>Function: seq--elt-safe</h3>
Return element of SEQUENCE at the index N.
If no element is found, return nil.</p>
<p>
(fn SEQUENCE N)<a name="lm-verify"></a>
<h3>Function: lm-verify</h3>
Check that the current buffer (or FILE if given) is in proper format.
If FILE is a directory, recurse on its files and generate a report in a
temporary buffer.  In that case, the optional argument SHOWOK
says display "OK" in temp buffer for files that have no problems.</p>
<p>
Optional argument VERBOSE specifies verbosity level.
Optional argument NON-FSF-OK if non-nil means a non-FSF
copyright notice is allowed.<a name="comint-previous-matching-input"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-previous-matching-input</h3>
Search backwards through input history for match for REGEXP.
(Previous history elements are earlier commands.)
With prefix argument N, search for Nth previous match.
If N is negative, find the next or Nth next match.</p>
<p>
(fn REGEXP N)<a name="jka-compr-make-temp-name"></a>
<h3>Function: jka-compr-make-temp-name</h3>
This routine will return the name of a new file.<a name="jit-lock-stealth-fontify"></a>
<h3>Function: jit-lock-stealth-fontify</h3>
Fontify buffers stealthily.
This function is called repeatedly after Emacs has become idle for
`jit-lock-stealth-time' seconds.  Optional argument REPEAT is expected
non-nil in a repeated invocation of this function.<a name="compilation-set-skip-threshold"></a>
<h3>Function: compilation-set-skip-threshold</h3>
Switch the `compilation-skip-threshold' level.<a name="lm-commentary-start"></a>
<h3>Function: lm-commentary-start</h3>
Return the buffer location of the `Commentary' start marker.<a name="ietf-drums-unfold-fws"></a>
<h3>Function: ietf-drums-unfold-fws</h3>
Unfold folding white space in the current buffer.<a name="Info-get-token"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-get-token</h3>
Return the token around POS.
POS must be somewhere inside the token.
START is a regular expression which will match the
    beginning of the tokens delimited string.
ALL is a regular expression with a single
    parenthesized subpattern which is the token to be
    returned.  E.g. '{(.*)}' would return any string
    enclosed in braces around POS.
ERRORSTRING optional fourth argument, controls action on no match:
    nil: return nil
    t: beep
    a string: signal an error, using that string.<a name="cl-truncate"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-truncate</h3>
Return a list of the integer part of X and the fractional part of X.
With two arguments, return truncation and remainder of their quotient.</p>
<p>
(fn X &optional Y)<a name="image-dired-display-thumbs"></a>
<h3>Function: image-dired-display-thumbs</h3>
Display thumbnails of all marked files, in `image-dired-thumbnail-buffer'.
If a thumbnail image does not exist for a file, it is created on the
fly.  With prefix argument ARG, display only thumbnail for file at
point (this is useful if you have marked some files but want to show
another one).</p>
<p>
Recommended usage is to split the current frame horizontally so that
you have the dired buffer in the left window and the
`image-dired-thumbnail-buffer' buffer in the right window.</p>
<p>
With optional argument APPEND, append thumbnail to thumbnail buffer
instead of erasing it first.</p>
<p>
Optional argument DO-NOT-POP controls if `pop-to-buffer' should be
used or not.  If non-nil, use `display-buffer' instead of
`pop-to-buffer'.  This is used from functions like
`image-dired-next-line-and-display' and
`image-dired-previous-line-and-display' where we do not want the
thumbnail buffer to be selected.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG APPEND DO-NOT-POP)<a name="timer-event-handler"></a>
<h3>Function: timer-event-handler</h3>
Call the handler for the timer TIMER.
This function is called, by name, directly by the C code.<a name="set-slot-value"></a>
<h3>Function: set-slot-value</h3>
Do the work for the macro `oset'.
Fills in OBJ's SLOT with VALUE.<a name="register-input-method"></a>
<h3>Function: register-input-method</h3>
Register INPUT-METHOD as an input method for language environment LANG-ENV.</p>
<p>
INPUT-METHOD and LANG-ENV are symbols or strings.
ACTIVATE-FUNC is a function to call to activate this method.
TITLE is a string to show in the mode line when this method is active.
DESCRIPTION is a string describing this method and what it is good for.
The ARGS, if any, are passed as arguments to ACTIVATE-FUNC.
All told, the arguments to ACTIVATE-FUNC are INPUT-METHOD and the ARGS.</p>
<p>
This function is mainly used in the file "leim-list.el" which is
created at Emacs build time, registering all Quail input methods
contained in the Emacs distribution.</p>
<p>
In case you want to register a new Quail input method by yourself, be
careful to use the same input method title as given in the third
parameter of `quail-define-package'.  (If the values are different, the
string specified in this function takes precedence.)</p>
<p>
The commands `describe-input-method' and `list-input-methods' need
these duplicated values to show some information about input methods
without loading the relevant Quail packages.</p>
<p>
(fn INPUT-METHOD LANG-ENV ACTIVATE-FUNC TITLE DESCRIPTION &rest ARGS)<a name="image-dired-dired-display-image"></a>
<h3>Function: image-dired-dired-display-image</h3>
Display current image file.

With prefix argument ARG, display image in its original size.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="gnus-random-x-face"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-random-x-face</h3>
Return X-Face header data chosen randomly from `gnus-x-face-directory'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="find-tag"></a>
<h3>Function: find-tag</h3>
Find tag (in current tags table) whose name contains TAGNAME.
Select the buffer containing the tag's definition, and move point there.
The default for TAGNAME is the expression in the buffer around or before point.</p>
<p>
If second arg NEXT-P is t (interactively, with prefix arg), search for
another tag that matches the last tagname or regexp used.  When there are
multiple matches for a tag, more exact matches are found first.  If NEXT-P
is the atom `-' (interactively, with prefix arg that is a negative number
or just M--), pop back to the previous tag gone to.</p>
<p>
If third arg REGEXP-P is non-nil, treat TAGNAME as a regexp.</p>
<p>
A marker representing the point when this command is invoked is pushed
onto a ring and may be popped back to with M-*.
Contrast this with the ring of marks gone to by the command.</p>
<p>
See documentation of variable `tags-file-name'.</p>
<p>

<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="ansi-color-filter-apply"></a>
<h3>Function: ansi-color-filter-apply</h3>
Filter out all ANSI control sequences from STRING.</p>
<p>
Every call to this function will set and use the buffer-local variable
`ansi-color-context' to save partial escape sequences.  This information
will be used for the next call to `ansi-color-apply'.  Set
`ansi-color-context' to nil if you don't want this.</p>
<p>
This function can be added to `comint-preoutput-filter-functions'.<a name="ansi-color-map-update"></a>
<h3>Function: ansi-color-map-update</h3>
Update `ansi-color-map'.</p>
<p>
Whenever the vectors used to construct `ansi-color-map' are changed,
this function is called.  Therefore this function is listed as the :set
property of `ansi-color-faces-vector' and `ansi-color-names-vector'.<a name="vc-state-refresh"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-state-refresh</h3>
Quickly recompute the `state' of FILE.<a name="turkish-case-conversion-enable"></a>

(fn SERVER &optional PORT NICK USER-NAME FULL-NAME STARTUP-CHANNELS PASSWORD ENCRYPTION)<a name="text-scale-increase"></a>
<h3>Function: text-scale-increase</h3>
Increase the height of the default face in the current buffer by INC steps.
If the new height is other than the default, `text-scale-mode' is enabled.</p>
<p>
Each step scales the height of the default face by the variable
`text-scale-mode-step' (a negative number of steps decreases the
height by the same amount).  As a special case, an argument of 0
will remove any scaling currently active.</p>
<p>
(fn INC)<a name="erc-fill"></a>
<h3>Function: erc-fill</h3>
Fill a region using the function referenced in `erc-fill-function'.
You can put this on `erc-insert-modify-hook' and/or `erc-send-modify-hook'.</p>

Returns FORM unchanged if it has no compiler macro, or if it has a
macro that returns its `&whole' argument.</p>
<p>
(fn FORM)<a name="local-variable-if-set-p"></a>
<h3>Function: local-variable-if-set-p</h3>
Non-nil if VARIABLE is local in buffer BUFFER when set there.
BUFFER defaults to the current buffer.</p>
<p>
More precisely, return non-nil if either VARIABLE already has a local
value in BUFFER, or if VARIABLE is automatically buffer-local (see
`make-variable-buffer-local').</p>
<p>
(fn VARIABLE &optional BUFFER)<a name="ispell-overlay-window"></a>

<h3>Function: help-with-tutorial-spec-language</h3>
Use the Emacs tutorial, specifying which language you want.<a name="search-forward-lax-whitespace"></a>
<h3>Function: search-forward-lax-whitespace</h3>
Search forward for STRING, matching a sequence of whitespace chars.<a name="current-kill"></a>
<h3>Function: current-kill</h3>
Rotate the yanking point by N places, and then return that kill.
If N is zero and `interprogram-paste-function' is set to a
function that returns a string or a list of strings, and if that
function doesn't return nil, then that string (or list) is added
to the front of the kill ring and the string (or first string in
the list) is returned as the latest kill.</p>
<p>
If N is not zero, and if `yank-pop-change-selection' is
non-nil, use `interprogram-cut-function' to transfer the
kill at the new yank point into the window system selection.</p>
<p>
If optional arg DO-NOT-MOVE is non-nil, then don't actually
move the yanking point; just return the Nth kill forward.<a name="x-get-selection-internal"></a>
<h3>Function: x-get-selection-internal</h3>
Return text selected from some X window.
SELECTION-SYMBOL is typically `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', or `CLIPBOARD'.
(Those are literal upper-case symbol names, since that's what X expects.)
TARGET-TYPE is the type of data desired, typically `STRING'.</p>
<p>
TIME-STAMP is the time to use in the XConvertSelection call for foreign
selections.  If omitted, defaults to the time for the last event.</p>
<p>
TERMINAL should be a terminal object or a frame specifying the X
server to query.  If omitted or nil, that stands for the selected
frame's display, or the first available X display.</p>
<p>
On Nextstep, TIME-STAMP and TERMINAL are unused.</p>
<p>
(fn SELECTION-SYMBOL TARGET-TYPE &optional TIME-STAMP TERMINAL)<a name="define-hash-table-test"></a>
<h3>Function: define-hash-table-test</h3>
Define a new hash table test with name NAME, a symbol.</p>
<p>
In hash tables created with NAME specified as test, use TEST to
compare keys, and HASH for computing hash codes of keys.</p>
<p>
TEST must be a function taking two arguments and returning non-nil if
both arguments are the same.  HASH must be a function taking one
argument and return an integer that is the hash code of the argument.
Hash code computation should use the whole value range of integers,
including negative integers.</p>
<p>
(fn NAME TEST HASH)<a name="file-executable-p"></a>
<h3>Function: file-executable-p</h3>

<h3>Function: tags-query-replace</h3>
Do `query-replace-regexp' of FROM with TO on all files listed in tags table.
Third arg DELIMITED (prefix arg) means replace only word-delimited matches.
If you exit (C-g, RET or q), you can resume the query replace
with the command M-,.
Fourth arg FILE-LIST-FORM non-nil means initialize the replacement loop.
Fifth and sixth arguments START and END are accepted, for compatibility
with `query-replace-regexp', and ignored.</p>
<p>
If FILE-LIST-FORM is non-nil, it is a form to evaluate to
produce the list of files to search.</p>
<p>
See also the documentation of the variable `tags-file-name'.</p>
<p>
(fn FROM TO &optional DELIMITED FILE-LIST-FORM)<a name="erc-identd-start"></a>
<h3>Function: erc-identd-start</h3>
Start an identd server listening to port 8113.
Port 113 (auth) will need to be redirected to port 8113 on your
machine -- using iptables, or a program like redir which can be
run from inetd.  The idea is to provide a simple identd server
when you need one, without having to install one globally on your
system.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional PORT)<a name="align-unhighlight-rule"></a>

<h3>Function: diff-mouse-goto-source</h3>
Jump to the corresponding source line.
`diff-jump-to-old-file' (or its opposite if the OTHER-FILE prefix arg
is given) determines whether to jump to the old or the new file.
If the prefix arg is bigger than 8 (for example with C-u C-u)
then `diff-jump-to-old-file' is also set, for the next invocations.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional OTHER-FILE EVENT)<a name="pcomplete--entries"></a>

Like `pcomplete-entries' but without env-var handling.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional REGEXP PREDICATE)<a name="ansi-color-filter-region"></a>
<h3>Function: ansi-color-filter-region</h3>
Filter out all ANSI control sequences from region BEGIN to END.</p>
<p>
Every call to this function will set and use the buffer-local variable
`ansi-color-context-region' to save position.  This information will be
used for the next call to `ansi-color-apply-on-region'.  Specifically,
it will override BEGIN, the start of the region.  Set
`ansi-color-context-region' to nil if you don't want this.<a name="set-display-table-and-terminal-coding-system"></a>
<h3>Function: set-display-table-and-terminal-coding-system</h3>
Set up the display table and terminal coding system for LANGUAGE-NAME.<a name="push-mark-command"></a>
<h3>Function: push-mark-command</h3>

Display `Mark set' unless the optional second arg NOMSG is non-nil.<a name="ediff-directories3"></a>
<h3>Function: ediff-directories3</h3>
Run Ediff on three directories, DIR1, DIR2, and DIR3, comparing files that
have the same name in all three.  The last argument, REGEXP, is nil or a
regular expression; only file names that match the regexp are considered.</p>
<p>
(fn DIR1 DIR2 DIR3 REGEXP)<a name="make-text-button"></a>
<h3>Function: make-text-button</h3>
Make a button from BEG to END in the current buffer.
The remaining arguments form a sequence of PROPERTY VALUE pairs,
specifying properties to add to the button.
In addition, the keyword argument :type may be used to specify a
button-type from which to inherit other properties; see
`define-button-type'.</p>
<p>
This function is like `make-button', except that the button is actually
part of the text instead of being a property of the buffer.  That is,
this function uses text properties, the other uses overlays.
Creating large numbers of buttons can also be somewhat faster
using `make-text-button'.  Note, however, that if there is an existing
face property at the site of the button, the button face may not be visible.
You may want to use `make-button' in that case.</p>
<p>
BEG can also be a string, in which case it is made into a button.</p>
<p>
Also see `insert-text-button'.<a name="posn-window"></a>
<h3>Function: posn-window</h3>
Return the window in POSITION.
POSITION should be a list of the form returned by the `event-start'
and `event-end' functions.<a name="flycheck-remove-error-file-names"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-remove-error-file-names</h3>
Remove matching FILE-NAME from ERRORS.</p>

Return ERRORS.<a name="constructor"></a>
<h3>Function: constructor</h3>
Default constructor for CLASS `eieio-default-superclass'.<a name="Info-index-nodes"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-index-nodes</h3>
Return a list of names of all index nodes in Info FILE.
If FILE is omitted, it defaults to the current Info file.
First look in a list of cached index node names.  Then scan Info
file and its subfiles for nodes with the index cookie.  Then try
to find index nodes starting from the first node in the top level
menu whose name contains the word "Index", plus any immediately
following nodes whose names also contain the word "Index".<a name="pcmpl-unix-user-names"></a>
<h3>Function: pcmpl-unix-user-names</h3>
Read the contents of /etc/passwd for user names.<a name="fontset-plain-name"></a>
<h3>Function: fontset-plain-name</h3>
Return a plain and descriptive name of FONTSET.<a name="sql-ingres"></a>
<h3>Function: sql-ingres</h3>
Run sql by Ingres as an inferior process.</p>
<p>
If buffer `*SQL*' exists but no process is running, make a new process.
If buffer exists and a process is running, just switch to buffer
`*SQL*'.</p>
<p>
Interpreter used comes from variable `sql-ingres-program'.  Login uses
the variable `sql-database' as default, if set.</p>
<p>
The buffer is put in SQL interactive mode, giving commands for sending
input.  See `sql-interactive-mode'.</p>
<p>
To set the buffer name directly, use C-u
before M-x sql-ingres.  Once session has started,
M-x sql-rename-buffer can be called separately to rename the
buffer.</p>
<p>
To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the input and output to the process, use C-x RET c
before M-x sql-ingres.  You can also specify this with C-x RET p
in the SQL buffer, after you start the process.
The default comes from `process-coding-system-alist' and
`default-process-coding-system'.</p>

<h3>Function: describe-copying</h3>
Display info on how you may redistribute copies of GNU Emacs.<a name="delete"></a>
<h3>Function: delete</h3>
Delete members of SEQ which are `equal' to ELT, and return the result.
SEQ must be a sequence (i.e. a list, a vector, or a string).
The return value is a sequence of the same type.</p>
<p>
If SEQ is a list, this behaves like `delq', except that it compares
with `equal' instead of `eq'.  In particular, it may remove elements
by altering the list structure.</p>
<p>
If SEQ is not a list, deletion is never performed destructively;
instead this function creates and returns a new vector or string.</p>
<p>
Write `(setq foo (delete element foo))' to be sure of correctly
changing the value of a sequence `foo'.</p>

(fn)<a name="checkdoc-current-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: checkdoc-current-buffer</h3>
Check current buffer for document, comment, error style, and rogue spaces.
With a prefix argument (in Lisp, the argument TAKE-NOTES),
store all errors found in a warnings buffer,
otherwise stop after the first error.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional TAKE-NOTES)<a name="event-end"></a>
<h3>Function: event-end</h3>
Return the ending location of EVENT.
EVENT should be a click, drag, or key press event.
If EVENT is a key press event, the return value has the form
    (WINDOW POS (0 . 0) 0)
If EVENT is a click event, this function is the same as
`event-start'.  For click and drag events, the return value has
the form
   (WINDOW AREA-OR-POS (X . Y) TIMESTAMP OBJECT POS (COL . ROW)
    IMAGE (DX . DY) (WIDTH . HEIGHT))
The `posn-' functions access elements of such lists.
For more information, see Info node `(elisp)Click Events'.</p>
<p>
If EVENT is a mouse or key press or a mouse click, this is the
position of the event.  If EVENT is a drag, this is the starting
position of the drag.<a name="comint-source-default"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-source-default</h3>
Compute the defaults for `load-file' and `compile-file' commands.</p>
<p>
PREVIOUS-DIR/FILE is a pair (DIRECTORY . FILENAME) from the last
source-file processing command, or nil if there hasn't been one yet.
SOURCE-MODES is a list used to determine what buffers contain source
files: if the major mode of the buffer is in SOURCE-MODES, it's source.
Typically, (lisp-mode) or (scheme-mode).</p>
<p>
If the command is given while the cursor is inside a string, *and*
the string is an existing filename, *and* the filename is not a directory,
then the string is taken as default.  This allows you to just position
your cursor over a string that's a filename and have it taken as default.</p>
<p>
If the command is given in a file buffer whose major mode is in
SOURCE-MODES, then the filename is the default file, and the
file's directory is the default directory.</p>
<p>
If the buffer isn't a source file buffer (e.g., it's the process buffer),
then the default directory & file are what was used in the last source-file
processing command (i.e., PREVIOUS-DIR/FILE).  If this is the first time
the command has been run (PREVIOUS-DIR/FILE is nil), the default directory
is the cwd, with no default file.  ("no default file" = nil)</p>
<p>
SOURCE-MODES is typically going to be something like (tea-mode)
for T programs, (lisp-mode) for Lisp programs, (soar-mode lisp-mode)
for Soar programs, etc.</p>
<p>
The function returns a pair: (default-directory . default-file).</p>

(fn FORM SYM PROP &optional DEF)<a name="font-lock-fontify-syntactic-anchored-keywords"></a>
<h3>Function: font-lock-fontify-syntactic-anchored-keywords</h3>
Fontify according to KEYWORDS until LIMIT.
KEYWORDS should be of the form MATCH-ANCHORED, see `font-lock-keywords',
LIMIT can be modified by the value of its PRE-MATCH-FORM.<a name="display-mm-height"></a>
<h3>Function: display-mm-height</h3>
Return the height of DISPLAY's screen in millimeters.
System values can be overridden by `display-mm-dimensions-alist'.
If the information is unavailable, value is nil.<a name="imagemagick-register-types"></a>
<h3>Function: imagemagick-register-types</h3>
Register file types that can be handled by ImageMagick.
This function is called at startup, after loading the init file.
It registers the ImageMagick types returned by `imagemagick-filter-types'.</p>
<p>
Registered image types are added to `auto-mode-alist', so that
Emacs visits them in Image mode.  They are also added to
`image-type-file-name-regexps', so that the `image-type' function
recognizes these files as having image type `imagemagick'.</p>
<p>
If Emacs is compiled without ImageMagick support, this does nothing.<a name="eudc-display-url"></a>
<h3>Function: eudc-display-url</h3>
Display URL and make it clickable.</p>
<p>
(fn URL)<a name="face-background"></a>
<h3>Function: face-background</h3>
Return the background color name of FACE, or nil if unspecified.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.</p>
<p>
If INHERIT is nil, only a background color directly defined by FACE is
  considered, so the return value may be nil.
If INHERIT is t, and FACE doesn't define a background color, then any
  background color that FACE inherits through its `:inherit' attribute
  is considered as well; however the return value may still be nil.
If INHERIT is a face or a list of faces, then it is used to try to
  resolve an unspecified background color.</p>
<p>
To ensure that a valid color is always returned, use a value of
`default' for INHERIT; this will resolve any unspecified values by
merging with the `default' face (which is always completely specified).<a name="-clone"></a>
<h3>Function: -clone</h3>
Create a deep copy of LIST.
The new list has the same elements and structure but all cons are
replaced with new ones.  This is useful when you need to clone a
structure such as plist or alist.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: eieio-defmethod</h3>
Obsolete work part of an old version of the `defmethod' macro.<a name="dabbrev--substitute-expansion"></a>
<h3>Function: dabbrev--substitute-expansion</h3>
Replace OLD with EXPANSION in the buffer.
OLD is text currently in the buffer, perhaps the abbreviation
or perhaps another expansion that was tried previously.
ABBREV is the abbreviation we are expanding.
It is " " if we are copying subsequent words.
EXPANSION is the expansion substring to be used this time.
RECORD-CASE-PATTERN, if non-nil, means set `dabbrev--last-case-pattern'
to record whether we upcased the expansion, downcased it, or did neither.</p>
<p>
(fn OLD ABBREV EXPANSION RECORD-CASE-PATTERN)<a name="x-get-selection"></a>
<h3>Function: x-get-selection</h3>
Return the value of an X Windows selection.
The argument TYPE (default `PRIMARY') says which selection,
and the argument DATA-TYPE (default `STRING') says
how to convert the data.</p>
<p>
TYPE may be any symbol (but nil stands for `PRIMARY').  However,
only a few symbols are commonly used.  They conventionally have
all upper-case names.  The most often used ones, in addition to
`PRIMARY', are `SECONDARY' and `CLIPBOARD'.</p>
<p>
DATA-TYPE is usually `STRING', but can also be one of the symbols
in `selection-converter-alist', which see.<a name="number-to-register"></a>
<h3>Function: number-to-register</h3>
Store a number in a register.
Two args, NUMBER and REGISTER (a character, naming the register).
If NUMBER is nil, a decimal number is read from the buffer starting
at point, and point moves to the end of that number.
Interactively, NUMBER is the prefix arg (none means nil).<a name="window-valid-p"></a>
<h3>Function: window-valid-p</h3>
Return t if OBJECT is a valid window and nil otherwise.
A valid window is either a window that displays a buffer or an internal
window.  Deleted windows are not live.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: where-is</h3>
Print message listing key sequences that invoke the command DEFINITION.
Argument is a command definition, usually a symbol with a function definition.
If INSERT (the prefix arg) is non-nil, insert the message in the buffer.<a name="minibuffer-complete-and-exit"></a>
<h3>Function: minibuffer-complete-and-exit</h3>
Exit if the minibuffer contains a valid completion.
Otherwise, try to complete the minibuffer contents.  If
completion leads to a valid completion, a repetition of this
command will exit.</p>
<p>
If `minibuffer-completion-confirm' is `confirm', do not try to
 complete; instead, ask for confirmation and accept any input if
 confirmed.
If `minibuffer-completion-confirm' is `confirm-after-completion',
 do not try to complete; instead, ask for confirmation if the
 preceding minibuffer command was a member of
 `minibuffer-confirm-exit-commands', and accept the input
 otherwise.</p>

<h3>Function: object-of-class-p</h3>
Return non-nil if OBJ is an instance of CLASS or CLASS' subclasses.<a name="vc-state"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-state</h3>
Return the version control state of FILE.</p>
<p>
A return of nil from this function means we have no information on the
status of this file.  Otherwise, the value returned is one of:</p>
<p>
  'up-to-date        The working file is unmodified with respect to the

during initialization.<a name="previous-error"></a>
<h3>Function: previous-error</h3>
Visit previous `next-error' message and corresponding source code.</p>
<p>
Prefix arg N says how many error messages to move backwards (or
forwards, if negative).</p>
<p>
This operates on the output from the M-x compile and M-x grep commands.<a name="gnus-newsgroup-directory-form"></a>

<p>

(fn EVENTS)<a name="ielm"></a>
<h3>Function: ielm</h3>
Interactively evaluate Emacs Lisp expressions.
Switches to the buffer `*ielm*', or creates it if it does not exist.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="frame-char-width"></a>
<h3>Function: frame-char-width</h3>
Width in pixels of characters in the font in frame FRAME.
If FRAME is omitted, the selected frame is used.
On a graphical screen, the width is the standard width of the default font.
For a terminal screen, the value is always 1.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FRAME)<a name="debug"></a>
<h3>Function: debug</h3>
Enter debugger.  `c' returns from the debugger.
Arguments are mainly for use when this is called from the internals
of the evaluator.</p>
<p>
You may call with no args, or you may pass nil as the first arg and
any other args you like.  In that case, the list of args after the
first will be printed into the backtrace buffer.<a name="find-operation-coding-system"></a>
<h3>Function: find-operation-coding-system</h3>
Choose a coding system for an operation based on the target name.
The value names a pair of coding systems: (DECODING-SYSTEM . ENCODING-SYSTEM).
DECODING-SYSTEM is the coding system to use for decoding
(in case OPERATION does decoding), and ENCODING-SYSTEM is the coding system
for encoding (in case OPERATION does encoding).</p>
<p>
The first argument OPERATION specifies an I/O primitive:
  For file I/O, `insert-file-contents' or `write-region'.
  For process I/O, `call-process', `call-process-region', or `start-process'.
  For network I/O, `open-network-stream'.</p>
<p>
The remaining arguments should be the same arguments that were passed
to the primitive.  Depending on which primitive, one of those arguments
is selected as the TARGET.  For example, if OPERATION does file I/O,
whichever argument specifies the file name is TARGET.</p>
<p>
TARGET has a meaning which depends on OPERATION:
  For file I/O, TARGET is a file name (except for the special case below).
  For process I/O, TARGET is a process name.
  For network I/O, TARGET is a service name or a port number.</p>
<p>
This function looks up what is specified for TARGET in
`file-coding-system-alist', `process-coding-system-alist',
or `network-coding-system-alist' depending on OPERATION.
They may specify a coding system, a cons of coding systems,
or a function symbol to call.
In the last case, we call the function with one argument,
which is a list of all the arguments given to this function.
If the function can't decide a coding system, it can return
`undecided' so that the normal code-detection is performed.</p>
<p>
If OPERATION is `insert-file-contents', the argument corresponding to
TARGET may be a cons (FILENAME . BUFFER).  In that case, FILENAME is a
file name to look up, and BUFFER is a buffer that contains the file's
contents (not yet decoded).  If `file-coding-system-alist' specifies a
function to call for FILENAME, that function should examine the
contents of BUFFER instead of reading the file.</p>
<p>
(fn OPERATION ARGUMENTS...)<a name="shell-backward-command"></a>

<h3>Function: nonincremental-repeat-search-forward</h3>
Search forward for the previous search string or regexp.<a name="display-multi-frame-p"></a>
<h3>Function: display-multi-frame-p</h3>
Return non-nil if DISPLAY is a graphic display.
Graphical displays are those which are capable of displaying several
frames and several different fonts at once.  This is true for displays
that use a window system such as X, and false for text-only terminals.
DISPLAY can be a display name, a frame, or nil (meaning the selected
frame's display).<a name="looking-back"></a>
<h3>Function: looking-back</h3>
Return non-nil if text before point matches regular expression REGEXP.
Like `looking-at' except matches before point, and is slower.
LIMIT if non-nil speeds up the search by specifying a minimum
starting position, to avoid checking matches that would start
before LIMIT.</p>
<p>
If GREEDY is non-nil, extend the match backwards as far as
possible, stopping when a single additional previous character
cannot be part of a match for REGEXP.  When the match is
extended, its starting position is allowed to occur before
LIMIT.<a name="floatp"></a>

(fn BASE-OP VAR)<a name="frames-on-display-list"></a>
<h3>Function: frames-on-display-list</h3>
Return a list of all frames on DEVICE.</p>
<p>
DEVICE should be a terminal, a frame,

HOST:SERVER.SCREEN).</p>
<p>
If DEVICE is omitted or nil, it defaults to the selected
frame's terminal device.<a name="append"></a>
<h3>Function: append</h3>
Concatenate all the arguments and make the result a list.

(fn)<a name="accessible-keymaps"></a>
<h3>Function: accessible-keymaps</h3>
Find all keymaps accessible via prefix characters from KEYMAP.
Returns a list of elements of the form (KEYS . MAP), where the sequence
KEYS starting from KEYMAP gets you to MAP.  These elements are ordered
so that the KEYS increase in length.  The first element is ([] . KEYMAP).
An optional argument PREFIX, if non-nil, should be a key sequence;
then the value includes only maps for prefixes that start with PREFIX.</p>

<h3>Function: rename-buffer</h3>
Change current buffer's name to NEWNAME (a string).
If second arg UNIQUE is nil or omitted, it is an error if a
buffer named NEWNAME already exists.
If UNIQUE is non-nil, come up with a new name using
`generate-new-buffer-name'.
Interactively, you can set UNIQUE with a prefix argument.
We return the name we actually gave the buffer.

<h3>Function: update-autoloads-from-directories</h3>
Update autoload definitions for Lisp files in the directories DIRS.
In an interactive call, you must give one argument, the name of a
single directory.  In a call from Lisp, you can supply multiple
directories as separate arguments, but this usage is discouraged.</p>
<p>
The function does NOT recursively descend into subdirectories of the
directory or directories specified.</p>
<p>
In an interactive call, prompt for a default output file for the
autoload definitions, and temporarily bind the variable
`generated-autoload-file' to this value.  When called from Lisp,
use the existing value of `generated-autoload-file'.  If any Lisp
file binds `generated-autoload-file' as a file-local variable,
write its autoloads into the specified file instead.</p>

<h3>Function: org-search-view</h3>
Show all entries that contain a phrase or words or regular expressions.</p>
<p>
With optional prefix argument TODO-ONLY, only consider entries that are
TODO entries.  The argument STRING can be used to pass a default search
string into this function.  If EDIT-AT is non-nil, it means that the
user should get a chance to edit this string, with cursor at position
EDIT-AT.</p>
<p>
The search string can be viewed either as a phrase that should be found as
is, or it can be broken into a number of snippets, each of which must match
in a Boolean way to select an entry.  The default depends on the variable
`org-agenda-search-view-always-boolean'.
Even if this is turned off (the default) you can always switch to
Boolean search dynamically by preceding the first word with  "+" or "-".</p>
<p>
The default is a direct search of the whole phrase, where each space in
the search string can expand to an arbitrary amount of whitespace,
including newlines.</p>
<p>
If using a Boolean search, the search string is split on whitespace and
each snippet is searched separately, with logical AND to select an entry.
Words prefixed with a minus must *not* occur in the entry.  Words without
a prefix or prefixed with a plus must occur in the entry.  Matching is
case-insensitive.  Words are enclosed by word delimiters (i.e. they must
match whole words, not parts of a word) if
`org-agenda-search-view-force-full-words' is set (default is nil).</p>
<p>
Boolean search snippets enclosed by curly braces are interpreted as
regular expressions that must or (when preceded with "-") must not
match in the entry.  Snippets enclosed into double quotes will be taken
as a whole, to include whitespace.</p>
<p>
- If the search string starts with an asterisk, search only in headlines.
- If (possibly after the leading star) the search string starts with an
  exclamation mark, this also means to look at TODO entries only, an effect
  that can also be achieved with a prefix argument.
- If (possibly after star and exclamation mark) the search string starts
  with a colon, this will mean that the (non-regexp) snippets of the
  Boolean search must match as full words.</p>
<p>
This command searches the agenda files, and in addition the files listed
in `org-agenda-text-search-extra-files'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional TODO-ONLY STRING EDIT-AT)<a name="write-abbrev-file"></a>
<h3>Function: write-abbrev-file</h3>
Write all user-level abbrev definitions to a file of Lisp code.
This does not include system abbrevs; it includes only the abbrev tables
listed in listed in `abbrev-table-name-list'.
The file written can be loaded in another session to define the same abbrevs.
The argument FILE is the file name to write.  If omitted or nil, the file
specified in `abbrev-file-name' is used.
If VERBOSE is non-nil, display a message indicating where abbrevs
have been saved.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FILE VERBOSE)<a name="accelerate-menu"></a>
<h3>Function: accelerate-menu</h3>
Start key navigation of the menu bar in FRAME.
This initially opens the first menu bar item and you can then navigate with the
arrow keys, select a menu entry with the return key or cancel with the
escape key.  If FRAME has no menu bar this function does nothing.</p>
<p>
If FRAME is nil or not given, use the selected frame.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FRAME)<a name="-every-p"></a>
<h3>Function: -every-p</h3>
Return t if (PRED x) is non-nil for all x in LIST, else nil.</p>

Major mode for editing Metafont sources.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="this-single-command-raw-keys"></a>
<h3>Function: this-single-command-raw-keys</h3>
Return the raw events that were read for this command.
More generally, it returns the last key sequence read, either by
the command loop or by `read-key-sequence'.
Unlike `this-single-command-keys', this function's value
shows the events before all translations (except for input methods).
The value is always a vector.</p>

<h3>Function: widget-remove-if</h3></p>
<p>

(fn PREDICATE LIST)<a name="byte-compile-discard"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-compile-discard</h3>
Output byte codes to discard the NUM entries at the top of the stack.
NUM defaults to 1.
If PRESERVE-TOS is non-nil, preserve the top-of-stack value, as if it were
popped before discarding the num values, and then pushed back again after
discarding.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional NUM PRESERVE-TOS)<a name="package-buffer-info"></a>
<h3>Function: package-buffer-info</h3>
Return a vector describing the package in the current buffer.
The vector has the form</p>
<p>
   [FILENAME REQUIRES DESCRIPTION VERSION COMMENTARY]</p>
<p>
FILENAME is the file name, a string, sans the ".el" extension.
REQUIRES is a list of requirements, each requirement having the
 form (NAME VER); NAME is a string and VER is a version list.
DESCRIPTION is the package description, a string.
VERSION is the version, a string.
COMMENTARY is the commentary section, a string, or nil if none.</p>
<p>
If the buffer does not contain a conforming package, signal an
error.  If there is a package, narrow the buffer to the file's
boundaries.<a name="split-window-below"></a>
<h3>Function: split-window-below</h3>
Split the selected window into two windows, one above the other.
The selected window is above.  The newly split-off window is
below, and displays the same buffer.  Return the new window.</p>
<p>
If optional argument SIZE is omitted or nil, both windows get the
same height, or close to it.  If SIZE is positive, the upper
(selected) window gets SIZE lines.  If SIZE is negative, the
lower (new) window gets -SIZE lines.</p>
<p>
If the variable `split-window-keep-point' is non-nil, both
windows get the same value of point as the selected window.
Otherwise, the window starts are chosen so as to minimize the
amount of redisplay; this is convenient on slow terminals.<a name="add-mode-abbrev"></a>
<h3>Function: add-mode-abbrev</h3>
Define mode-specific abbrev for last word(s) before point.
Argument is how many words before point form the expansion;
or zero means the region is the expansion.
A negative argument means to undefine the specified abbrev.
Reads the abbreviation in the minibuffer.</p>
<p>
Don't use this function in a Lisp program; use `define-abbrev' instead.</p>
<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="custom-face-menu-create"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-face-menu-create</h3>
Ignoring WIDGET, create a menu entry for customization face SYMBOL.<a name="json-read-file"></a>

<p>
(fn NEW PREDICATE SEQ [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="compilation-find-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: compilation-find-buffer</h3>
Return a compilation buffer.
If AVOID-CURRENT is nil, and the current buffer is a compilation buffer,
return it.  If AVOID-CURRENT is non-nil, return the current buffer only
as a last resort.<a name="diff-yank-function"></a>
<h3>Function: diff-yank-function</h3></p>
<p>

(fn TEXT)<a name="Info-last"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-last</h3>
Go back in the history to the last node visited.<a name="comint-update-fence"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-update-fence</h3>
Update read-only status of newline before point.
The `fence' read-only property is used to indicate that a newline
is read-only for no other reason than to "fence off" a
following front-sticky read-only region.  This is used to
implement comint read-only prompts.  If the text after a newline
changes, the read-only status of that newline may need updating.
That is what this function does.</p>
<p>
This function does nothing if point is not at the beginning of a
line, or is at the beginning of the accessible portion of the buffer.
Otherwise, if the character after point has a front-sticky
read-only property, then the preceding newline is given a
read-only property of `fence', unless it already is read-only.
If the character after point does not have a front-sticky
read-only property, any read-only property of `fence' on the
preceding newline is removed.</p>
<p>

(fn START-EVENT END-EVENT)<a name="sql-mysql"></a>
<h3>Function: sql-mysql</h3>
Run mysql by TcX as an inferior process.</p>
<p>
Mysql versions 3.23 and up are free software.</p>
<p>
If buffer `*SQL*' exists but no process is running, make a new process.
If buffer exists and a process is running, just switch to buffer
`*SQL*'.</p>
<p>
Interpreter used comes from variable `sql-mysql-program'.  Login uses
the variables `sql-user', `sql-password', `sql-database', and
`sql-server' as defaults, if set.  Additional command line parameters
can be stored in the list `sql-mysql-options'.</p>
<p>
The buffer is put in SQL interactive mode, giving commands for sending
input.  See `sql-interactive-mode'.</p>
<p>
To set the buffer name directly, use C-u
before M-x sql-mysql.  Once session has started,
M-x sql-rename-buffer can be called separately to rename the
buffer.</p>
<p>
To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the input and output to the process, use C-x RET c
before M-x sql-mysql.  You can also specify this with C-x RET p
in the SQL buffer, after you start the process.
The default comes from `process-coding-system-alist' and
`default-process-coding-system'.</p>
<p>
(Type C-h m in the SQL buffer for a list of commands.)</p>
<p>
(fn &optional BUFFER)<a name="list-yahrzeit-dates"></a>

from the cursor position.</p>
<p>
(fn DEATH-DATE START-YEAR END-YEAR)<a name="event-basic-type"></a>
<h3>Function: event-basic-type</h3>
Return the basic type of the given event (all modifiers removed).
The value is a printing character (not upper case) or a symbol.
EVENT may be an event or an event type.  If EVENT is a symbol
that has never been used in an event that has been read as input
in the current Emacs session, then this function may return nil.<a name="vc-git-log-incoming"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-git-log-incoming</h3></p>
<p>

(fn BUFFER REMOTE-LOCATION)<a name="checkdoc-ispell"></a>
<h3>Function: checkdoc-ispell</h3>

<h3>Function: byte-compile-macroexpand-declare-function</h3></p>
<p>

(fn FN FILE &rest ARGS)<a name="display-warning"></a>
<h3>Function: display-warning</h3>
Display a warning message, MESSAGE.
TYPE is the warning type: either a custom group name (a symbol),
or a list of symbols whose first element is a custom group name.
(The rest of the symbols represent subcategories, for warning purposes
only, and you can use whatever symbols you like.)</p>
<p>
LEVEL should be either :debug, :warning, :error, or :emergency
(but see `warning-minimum-level' and `warning-minimum-log-level').
Default is :warning.</p>
<p>
:emergency -- a problem that will seriously impair Emacs operation soon
	      if you do not attend to it promptly.
:error     -- data or circumstances that are inherently wrong.
:warning   -- data or circumstances that are not inherently wrong,
	      but raise suspicion of a possible problem.
:debug     -- info for debugging only.</p>
<p>
BUFFER-NAME, if specified, is the name of the buffer for logging
the warning.  By default, it is `*Warnings*'.  If this function
has to create the buffer, it disables undo in the buffer.</p>
<p>
See the `warnings' custom group for user customization features.</p>
<p>
See also `warning-series', `warning-prefix-function' and
`warning-fill-prefix' for additional programming features.<a name="custom-variable-reset-standard"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-variable-reset-standard</h3>
Restore standard setting for the variable edited by WIDGET.
This operation eliminates any saved setting for the variable,
restoring it to the state of a variable that has never been customized.
The value that was current before this operation
becomes the backup value, so you can get it again.<a name="widget-type-default-get"></a>
<h3>Function: widget-type-default-get</h3>
Get default value from the :type attribute of WIDGET.</p>

(fn)<a name="custom-initialize-set"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-initialize-set</h3>
Initialize SYMBOL based on VALUE.
If the symbol doesn't have a default binding already,
then set it using its `:set' function (or `set-default' if it has none).
The value is either the value in the symbol's `saved-value' property,
if any, or VALUE.<a name="x-selection-owner-p"></a>
<h3>Function: x-selection-owner-p</h3>
Whether the current Emacs process owns the given X Selection.
The arg should be the name of the selection in question, typically one of
the symbols `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', or `CLIPBOARD'.
(Those are literal upper-case symbol names, since that's what X expects.)
For convenience, the symbol nil is the same as `PRIMARY',
and t is the same as `SECONDARY'.</p>
<p>
TERMINAL should be a terminal object or a frame specifying the X
server to query.  If omitted or nil, that stands for the selected
frame's display, or the first available X display.</p>
<p>
On Nextstep, TERMINAL is unused.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional SELECTION TERMINAL)<a name="map-query-replace-regexp"></a>
<h3>Function: map-query-replace-regexp</h3>
Replace some matches for REGEXP with various strings, in rotation.
The second argument TO-STRINGS contains the replacement strings, separated
by spaces.  This command works like `query-replace-regexp' except that
each successive replacement uses the next successive replacement string,
wrapping around from the last such string to the first.</p>
<p>
In Transient Mark mode, if the mark is active, operate on the contents
of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the end of the buffer.</p>
<p>
Non-interactively, TO-STRINGS may be a list of replacement strings.</p>
<p>
Use M-n to pull the last incremental search regexp to the minibuffer
that reads REGEXP.</p>
<p>
A prefix argument N says to use each replacement string N times
before rotating to the next.
Fourth and fifth arg START and END specify the region to operate on.<a name="isearch-backslash"></a>

(fn)<a name="compilation-buffer-name"></a>
<h3>Function: compilation-buffer-name</h3>
Return the name of a compilation buffer to use.
If NAME-FUNCTION is non-nil, call it with one argument NAME-OF-MODE
to determine the buffer name.
Likewise if `compilation-buffer-name-function' is non-nil.
If current buffer has the major mode MODE-COMMAND,
return the name of the current buffer, so that it gets reused.
Otherwise, construct a buffer name from NAME-OF-MODE.<a name="cl-nset-difference"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-nset-difference</h3>
Combine LIST1 and LIST2 using a set-difference operation.
The resulting list contains all items that appear in LIST1 but not LIST2.
This is a destructive function; it reuses the storage of LIST1 and LIST2

Return alist of (CHAR-NAME . CHAR-CODE) pairs cached in `ucs-names'.<a name="abbrev-symbol"></a>
<h3>Function: abbrev-symbol</h3>
Return the symbol representing abbrev named ABBREV.
This symbol's name is ABBREV, but it is not the canonical symbol of that name;
it is interned in an abbrev-table rather than the normal obarray.
The value is nil if that abbrev is not defined.
Optional second arg TABLE is abbrev table to look it up in.
The default is to try buffer's mode-specific abbrev table, then global table.</p>
<p>
(fn ABBREV &optional TABLE)<a name="pr-ps-buffer-using-ghostscript"></a>
<h3>Function: pr-ps-buffer-using-ghostscript</h3>
Print buffer using PostScript through ghostscript.</p>
<p>
Interactively, the command prompts for N-UP printing number and, when you use a
prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the user for a file name, and saves
the PostScript image in that file instead of sending it to the printer.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, if N-UP is nil, prompts for N-UP printing number.  The
argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it's nil, send the image to the
printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save the PostScript image in a file with
that name.  If FILENAME is t, prompts for a file name.</p>

<p>
(fn &optional HERE FULL MESSAGE)<a name="scheme-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: scheme-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing Scheme code.
Editing commands are similar to those of `lisp-mode'.</p>
<p>
In addition, if an inferior Scheme process is running, some additional
commands will be defined, for evaluating expressions and controlling
the interpreter, and the state of the process will be displayed in the
mode line of all Scheme buffers.  The names of commands that interact
with the Scheme process start with "xscheme-" if you use the MIT
Scheme-specific `xscheme' package; for more information see the
documentation for `xscheme-interaction-mode'.  Use M-x run-scheme to
start an inferior Scheme using the more general `cmuscheme' package.</p>
<p>
Commands:
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.
Blank lines separate paragraphs.  Semicolons start comments.</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `scheme-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
Entry to this mode calls the value of `scheme-mode-hook'
if that value is non-nil.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="forward-page"></a>
<h3>Function: forward-page</h3>
Move forward to page boundary.  With arg, repeat, or go back if negative.

<p>
(fn)<a name="multiple-value-apply"></a>
<h3>Function: multiple-value-apply</h3>
Evaluate EXPRESSION to get multiple values and apply FUNCTION to them.
This handles multiple values in Common Lisp style, but it does not work
right when EXPRESSION calls an ordinary Emacs Lisp function that returns just
one value.</p>
<p>
(fn FUNCTION EXPRESSION)<a name="pr-txt-buffer"></a>

<h3>Function: ethio-fidel-to-sera-buffer</h3>
Replace all the FIDEL characters in the current buffer to the SERA format.
The variable `ethio-primary-language' specifies the primary
language and `ethio-secondary-language' specifies the secondary.</p>
<p>
If the 1st optional argument SECONDARY is non-nil, try to convert the
region so that it begins with the secondary language; otherwise with the
primary language.</p>
<p>
If the 2nd optional argument FORCE is non-nil, convert even if the
buffer is read-only.</p>
<p>
See also the descriptions of the variables

If CONCISE is non-nil, display a concise version of the startup
screen.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional CONCISE)<a name="font-get-glyphs"></a>
<h3>Function: font-get-glyphs</h3>
Return a vector of FONT-OBJECT's glyphs for the specified characters.
FROM and TO are positions (integers or markers) specifying a region
of the current buffer.
If the optional fourth arg OBJECT is not nil, it is a string or a
vector containing the target characters.</p>
<p>
Each element is a vector containing information of a glyph in this format:
  [FROM-IDX TO-IDX C CODE WIDTH LBEARING RBEARING ASCENT DESCENT ADJUSTMENT]
where
  FROM is an index numbers of a character the glyph corresponds to.
  TO is the same as FROM.
  C is the character of the glyph.
  CODE is the glyph-code of C in FONT-OBJECT.
  WIDTH thru DESCENT are the metrics (in pixels) of the glyph.
  ADJUSTMENT is always nil.
If FONT-OBJECT doesn't have a glyph for a character,
the corresponding element is nil.</p>
<p>
(fn FONT-OBJECT FROM TO &optional OBJECT)<a name="set-window-vscroll"></a>
<h3>Function: set-window-vscroll</h3>
Set amount by which WINDOW should be scrolled vertically to VSCROLL.
WINDOW nil means use the selected window.  Normally, VSCROLL is a
non-negative multiple of the canonical character height of WINDOW;
optional third arg PIXELS-P non-nil means that VSCROLL is in pixels.
If PIXELS-P is nil, VSCROLL may have to be rounded so that it
corresponds to an integral number of pixels.  The return value is the
result of this rounding.
If PIXELS-P is non-nil, the return value is VSCROLL.</p>
<p>
(fn WINDOW VSCROLL &optional PIXELS-P)<a name="decode-coding-region"></a>
<h3>Function: decode-coding-region</h3>
Decode the current region from the specified coding system.
When called from a program, takes four arguments:
	START, END, CODING-SYSTEM, and DESTINATION.
START and END are buffer positions.</p>
<p>
Optional 4th arguments DESTINATION specifies where the decoded text goes.
If nil, the region between START and END is replaced by the decoded text.
If buffer, the decoded text is inserted in that buffer after point (point
does not move).
In those cases, the length of the decoded text is returned.
If DESTINATION is t, the decoded text is returned.</p>
<p>
This function sets `last-coding-system-used' to the precise coding system
used (which may be different from CODING-SYSTEM if CODING-SYSTEM is
not fully specified.)</p>

(fn)<a name="vc-update"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-update</h3>
Update the current fileset or branch.
You must be visiting a version controlled file, or in a `vc-dir' buffer.
On a distributed version control system, this runs a "pull"
operation to update the current branch, prompting for an argument
list if required.  Optional prefix ARG forces a prompt.</p>
<p>
On a non-distributed version control system, update the current
fileset to the tip revisions.  For each unchanged and unlocked
file, this simply replaces the work file with the latest revision
on its branch.  If the file contains changes, any changes in the
tip revision are merged into the working file.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="texinfo-format-region"></a>
<h3>Function: texinfo-format-region</h3>
Convert the current region of the Texinfo file to Info format.
This lets you see what that part of the file will look like in Info.

<p>
(fn REGION-BEGINNING REGION-END)<a name="browse-url-mosaic"></a>
<h3>Function: browse-url-mosaic</h3>
Ask the XMosaic WWW browser to load URL.</p>
<p>
Default to the URL around or before point.  The strings in variable
`browse-url-mosaic-arguments' are also passed to Mosaic and the
program is invoked according to the variable
`browse-url-mosaic-program'.</p>
<p>
When called interactively, if variable `browse-url-new-window-flag' is
non-nil, load the document in a new Mosaic window, otherwise use a
random existing one.  A non-nil interactive prefix argument reverses
the effect of `browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
When called non-interactively, optional second argument NEW-WINDOW is
used instead of `browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
(fn URL &optional NEW-WINDOW)<a name="flycheck-checker-get"></a>

<h3>Function: kill-visual-line</h3>
Kill the rest of the visual line.
With prefix argument ARG, kill that many visual lines from point.
If ARG is negative, kill visual lines backward.
If ARG is zero, kill the text before point on the current visual
line.</p>
<p>
If you want to append the killed line to the last killed text,
use C-M-w before C-k.</p>
<p>
If the buffer is read-only, Emacs will beep and refrain from deleting
the line, but put the line in the kill ring anyway.  This means that
you can use this command to copy text from a read-only buffer.
(If the variable `kill-read-only-ok' is non-nil, then this won't
even beep.)<a name="completion--string-equal-p"></a>
<h3>Function: completion--string-equal-p</h3></p>
<p>

(fn S1 S2)<a name="file-nlinks"></a>
<h3>Function: file-nlinks</h3>

<h3>Function: profiler-memory-start</h3>
Start/restart the memory profiler.
The memory profiler will take samples of the call-stack whenever a new
allocation takes place.  Note that most small allocations only trigger
the profiler occasionally.
See also `profiler-log-size' and `profiler-max-stack-depth'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="coding-system-aliases"></a>
<h3>Function: coding-system-aliases</h3>

<h3>Function: regexp-opt-group</h3>
Return a regexp to match a string in the sorted list STRINGS.
If PAREN non-nil, output regexp parentheses around returned regexp.
If LAX non-nil, don't output parentheses if it doesn't require them.
Merges keywords to avoid backtracking in Emacs's regexp matcher.<a name="count-matches"></a>
<h3>Function: count-matches</h3>
Print and return number of matches for REGEXP following point.
When called from Lisp and INTERACTIVE is omitted or nil, just return
the number, do not print it; if INTERACTIVE is t, the function behaves
in all respects as if it had been called interactively.</p>
<p>
If REGEXP contains upper case characters (excluding those preceded by `\')
and `search-upper-case' is non-nil, the matching is case-sensitive.</p>
<p>
Second and third arg RSTART and REND specify the region to operate on.</p>
<p>
Interactively, in Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, operate
on the contents of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the
end of (the accessible portion of) the buffer.</p>
<p>
This function starts looking for the next match from the end of
the previous match.  Hence, it ignores matches that overlap
a previously found match.<a name="epa-mail-decrypt"></a>
<h3>Function: epa-mail-decrypt</h3>
Decrypt OpenPGP armors in the current buffer.

Return an Emacs frame object.
PARMS is an alist of frame parameters.
If the parameters specify that the frame should not have a minibuffer,
and do not specify a specific minibuffer window to use,
then `default-minibuffer-frame' must be a frame whose minibuffer can
be shared by the new frame.</p>
<p>
This function is an internal primitive--use `make-frame' instead.</p>

<p>
Optional third arg NOCOPY non-nil means it is OK to return STRING itself
if the decoding operation is trivial.</p>
<p>
Optional fourth arg BUFFER non-nil means that the decoded text is
inserted in that buffer after point (point does not move).  In this
case, the return value is the length of the decoded text.</p>
<p>
This function sets `last-coding-system-used' to the precise coding system
used (which may be different from CODING-SYSTEM if CODING-SYSTEM is
not fully specified.)</p>

<h3>Function: gnutls-bye</h3>
Terminate current GnuTLS connection for process PROC.
The connection should have been initiated using `gnutls-handshake'.</p>
<p>
If CONT is not nil the TLS connection gets terminated and further
receives and sends will be disallowed.  If the return value is zero you
may continue using the connection.  If CONT is nil, GnuTLS actually
sends an alert containing a close request and waits for the peer to
reply with the same message.  In order to reuse the connection you
should wait for an EOF from the peer.</p>
<p>
This function may also return `gnutls-e-again', or
`gnutls-e-interrupted'.</p>
<p>
(fn PROC CONT)<a name="string-as-unibyte"></a>
<h3>Function: string-as-unibyte</h3>
Return a unibyte string with the same individual bytes as STRING.
If STRING is unibyte, the result is STRING itself.

<p>
(fn FN INITIAL-VALUE LIST)<a name="compilation-fake-loc"></a>
<h3>Function: compilation-fake-loc</h3>
Preassociate MARKER with FILE.
FILE should be ABSOLUTE-FILENAME or (RELATIVE-FILENAME . DIRNAME).
This is useful when you compile temporary files, but want
automatic translation of the messages to the real buffer from
which the temporary file came.  This may also affect previous messages
about FILE.</p>
<p>
Optional args LINE and COL default to 1 and beginning of
indentation respectively.  The marker is expected to reflect
this.  In the simplest case the marker points to the first line
of the region that was saved to the temp file.</p>
<p>
If you concatenate several regions into the temp file (e.g. a
header with variable assignments and a code region), you must
call this several times, once each for the last line of one
region and the first line of the next region.<a name="gnus-horizontal-recenter"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-horizontal-recenter</h3>
Recenter the current buffer horizontally.<a name="byte-recompile-directory"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-recompile-directory</h3>
Recompile every `.el' file in DIRECTORY that needs recompilation.
This happens when a `.elc' file exists but is older than the `.el' file.
Files in subdirectories of DIRECTORY are processed also.</p>
<p>
If the `.elc' file does not exist, normally this function *does not*
compile the corresponding `.el' file.  However, if the prefix argument
ARG is 0, that means do compile all those files.  A nonzero
ARG means ask the user, for each such `.el' file, whether to
compile it.  A nonzero ARG also means ask about each subdirectory
before scanning it.</p>
<p>
If the third argument FORCE is non-nil, recompile every `.el' file
that already has a `.elc' file.</p>

This file is not the file you visited; that changes only when you save.
Normally we run the normal hook `auto-save-hook' before saving.</p>
<p>
A non-nil NO-MESSAGE argument means do not print any message if successful.
A non-nil CURRENT-ONLY argument means save only current buffer.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional NO-MESSAGE CURRENT-ONLY)<a name="ert--results-update-stats-display-maybe"></a>
<h3>Function: ert--results-update-stats-display-maybe</h3>

(fn)<a name="find-file-at-point"></a>
<h3>Function: find-file-at-point</h3>
Find FILENAME, guessing a default from text around point.
If `ffap-url-regexp' is not nil, the FILENAME may also be an URL.
With a prefix, this command behaves exactly like `ffap-file-finder'.
If `ffap-require-prefix' is set, the prefix meaning is reversed.
See also the variables `ffap-dired-wildcards', `ffap-newfile-prompt',
and the functions `ffap-file-at-point' and `ffap-url-at-point'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FILENAME)<a name="electric-pair-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: electric-pair-mode</h3>
Toggle automatic parens pairing (Electric Pair mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Electric Pair mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Electric Pair mode is a global minor mode.  When enabled, typing
an open parenthesis automatically inserts the corresponding
closing parenthesis.  (Likewise for brackets, etc.)</p>
<p>

(fn)<a name="hack-local-variables-filter"></a>
<h3>Function: hack-local-variables-filter</h3>
Filter local variable settings, querying the user if necessary.
VARIABLES is the alist of variable-value settings.  This alist is
 filtered based on the values of `ignored-local-variables',
 `enable-local-eval', `enable-local-variables', and (if necessary)
 user interaction.  The results are added to
 `file-local-variables-alist', without applying them.
If these settings come from directory-local variables, then
DIR-NAME is the name of the associated directory.  Otherwise it is nil.<a name="window--in-direction-2"></a>
<h3>Function: window--in-direction-2</h3>
Support function for `window-in-direction'.<a name="kill-sentence"></a>
<h3>Function: kill-sentence</h3>
Kill from point to end of sentence.
With arg, repeat; negative arg -N means kill back to Nth start of sentence.<a name="flycheck-temp-file-system"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-temp-file-system</h3>
Create a temporary file named after FILENAME.</p>
<p>
If FILENAME is non-nil, this function creates a temporary
directory with `flycheck-temp-dir-system', and creates a file
with the same name as FILENAME in this directory.</p>
<p>
Otherwise this function creates a temporary file with
`flycheck-temp-prefix' and a random suffix.  The path of the file
is added to `flycheck-temporaries'.</p>
<p>
Add the path of the file to `flycheck-temporaries'.</p>
<p>
Return the path of the file.<a name="gnus-output-to-rmail"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-output-to-rmail</h3>

else cover the whole buffer.</p>
<p>
(fn START END)<a name="cl-union"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-union</h3>
Combine LIST1 and LIST2 using a set-union operation.
The resulting list contains all items that appear in either LIST1 or LIST2.
This is a non-destructive function; it makes a copy of the data if necessary
to avoid corrupting the original LIST1 and LIST2.</p>
<p>
Keywords supported:  :test :test-not :key</p>
<p>
(fn LIST1 LIST2 [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="face-documentation"></a>
<h3>Function: face-documentation</h3>

WINDOW is the window where the drop happened.
STRING is the uri-list as a string.  The URIs are separated by \r\n.<a name="mouse-yank-at-click"></a>
<h3>Function: mouse-yank-at-click</h3>
Insert the last stretch of killed text at the position clicked on.
Also move point to one end of the text thus inserted (normally the end),
and set mark at the beginning.
Prefix arguments are interpreted as with C-y.
If `mouse-yank-at-point' is non-nil, insert at point
regardless of where you click.</p>
<p>
(fn CLICK ARG)<a name="completion--done"></a>
<h3>Function: completion--done</h3></p>
<p>

(fn STRING &optional FINISHED MESSAGE)<a name="vc-root-diff"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-root-diff</h3>
Display diffs between VC-controlled whole tree revisions.
Normally, this compares the tree corresponding to the current
fileset with the working revision.
With a prefix argument HISTORIC, prompt for two revision
designators specifying which revisions to compare.</p>
<p>
The optional argument NOT-URGENT non-nil means it is ok to say no to
saving the buffer.</p>
<p>
(fn HISTORIC &optional NOT-URGENT)<a name="standard-display-european"></a>
<h3>Function: standard-display-european</h3>
Semi-obsolete way to toggle display of ISO 8859 European characters.</p>
<p>
This function is semi-obsolete; you probably don't need it, or else you
probably should use `set-language-environment' or `set-locale-environment'.</p>
<p>
This function enables European character display if ARG is positive,
disables it if negative.  Otherwise, it toggles European character display.</p>
<p>
When this mode is enabled, characters in the range of 160 to 255
display not as octal escapes, but as accented characters.  Codes 146
and 160 display as apostrophe and space, even though they are not the
ASCII codes for apostrophe and space.</p>
<p>
Enabling European character display with this command noninteractively
from Lisp code also selects Latin-1 as the language environment.
This provides increased compatibility for users who call this function
in `.emacs'.<a name="tty-handle-reverse-video"></a>
<h3>Function: tty-handle-reverse-video</h3>
Handle the reverse-video frame parameter for terminal frames.<a name="srecode-template-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: srecode-template-mode</h3>
Major-mode for writing SRecode macros.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="move-to-column"></a>
<h3>Function: move-to-column</h3>
Move point to column COLUMN in the current line.
Interactively, COLUMN is the value of prefix numeric argument.
The column of a character is calculated by adding together the widths
as displayed of the previous characters in the line.
This function ignores line-continuation;
there is no upper limit on the column number a character can have
and horizontal scrolling has no effect.</p>
<p>
If specified column is within a character, point goes after that character.
If it's past end of line, point goes to end of line.</p>
<p>
Optional second argument FORCE non-nil means if COLUMN is in the
middle of a tab character, change it to spaces.
In addition, if FORCE is t, and the line is too short to reach
COLUMN, add spaces/tabs to get there.</p>
<p>
The return value is the current column.</p>
<p>
(fn COLUMN &optional FORCE)<a name="byte-compile-report-error"></a>

URL    is the url you are requesting authorization to.  This can be either a
       string representing the URL, or the parsed representation returned by
       `url-generic-parse-url'
REALM  is the realm at a specific site we are looking for.  This should be a
       string specifying the exact realm, or nil or the symbol 'any' to
       specify that the filename portion of the URL should be used as the
       realm
TYPE   is the type of authentication to be returned.  This is either a string
       representing the type (basic, digest, etc), or nil or the symbol 'any'
       to specify that any authentication is acceptable.  If requesting 'any'
       the strongest matching authentication will be returned.  If this is
       wrong, it's no big deal, the error from the server will specify exactly
       what type of auth to use
PROMPT is boolean - specifies whether to ask the user for a username/password
       if one cannot be found in the cache<a name="display-planes"></a>
<h3>Function: display-planes</h3>
Return the number of planes supported by DISPLAY.<a name="kill-whole-line"></a>
<h3>Function: kill-whole-line</h3>
Kill current line.
With prefix ARG, kill that many lines starting from the current line.

Check if there is no current error more severe than LEVEL.<a name="x-handle-args"></a>
<h3>Function: x-handle-args</h3>
Process the X (or Nextstep) related command line options in ARGS.
This is done before the user's startup file is loaded.
Copies the options in ARGS to `x-invocation-args'.  It then extracts
the X (or Nextstep) options according to the handlers defined in
`command-line-x-option-alist' (or `command-line-ns-option-alist').
For example, `x-handle-switch' handles a switch like "-fg" and its
value "black".  This function returns ARGS minus the arguments that
have been processed.<a name="minibuffer-depth-indicate-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: minibuffer-depth-indicate-mode</h3>
Toggle Minibuffer Depth Indication mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Minibuffer Depth Indication
mode if ARG is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called
from Lisp, enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Minibuffer Depth Indication mode is a global minor mode.  When
enabled, any recursive use of the minibuffer will show the
recursion depth in the minibuffer prompt.  This is only useful if
`enable-recursive-minibuffers' is non-nil.</p>

<p>
(fn)<a name="font-lock-fillin-text-property"></a>
<h3>Function: font-lock-fillin-text-property</h3>

Arguments PROP and VALUE specify the property and value to put where none are
already in place.  Therefore existing property values are not overwritten.
Optional argument OBJECT is the string or buffer containing the text.<a name="pr-ps-fast-fire"></a>
<h3>Function: pr-ps-fast-fire</h3>
Fast fire function for PostScript printing.</p>
<p>
If a region is active, the region will be printed instead of the whole buffer.
Also if the current major-mode is defined in `pr-mode-alist', the settings in
`pr-mode-alist' will be used, that is, the current buffer or region will be
printed using `pr-ps-mode-ps-print'.</p>
<p>

Interactively, you have the following situations:</p>
<p>
   M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET
      The command prompts the user for a N-UP value and printing will
      immediately be done using the current active printer.</p>
<p>
   C-u   M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET
   C-u 0 M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET
      The command prompts the user for a N-UP value and also for a current
      PostScript printer, then printing will immediately be done using the new
      current active printer.</p>
<p>
   C-u 1 M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET
      The command prompts the user for a N-UP value and also for a file name,
      and saves the PostScript image in that file instead of sending it to the
      printer.</p>
<p>
   C-u 2 M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET
      The command prompts the user for a N-UP value, then for a current
      PostScript printer and, finally, for a file name.  Then change the active
      printer to that chosen by user and saves the PostScript image in
      that file instead of sending it to the printer.</p>
<p>

Noninteractively, the argument N-UP should be a positive integer greater than
zero and the argument SELECT is treated as follows:</p>
<p>
   If it's nil, send the image to the printer.</p>
<p>
   If it's a list or an integer lesser or equal to zero, the command prompts
   the user for a current PostScript printer, then printing will immediately
   be done using the new current active printer.</p>
<p>
   If it's an integer equal to 1, the command prompts the user for a file name
   and saves the PostScript image in that file instead of sending it to the
   printer.</p>
<p>
   If it's an integer greater or equal to 2, the command prompts the user for a
   current PostScript printer and for a file name.  Then change the active
   printer to that chosen by user and saves the PostScript image in that file
   instead of sending it to the printer.</p>
<p>
   If it's a symbol which it's defined in `pr-ps-printer-alist', it's the new
   active printer and printing will immediately be done using the new active
   printer.</p>
<p>
   Otherwise, send the image to the printer.</p>
<p>

Note that this command always behaves as if `pr-auto-region' and `pr-auto-mode'
are both set to t.</p>

<h3>Function: table-generate-source</h3>
Generate source of the current table in the specified language.
LANGUAGE is a symbol that specifies the language to describe the
structure of the table.  It must be either 'html, 'latex or 'cals.
The resulted source text is inserted into DEST-BUFFER and the buffer
object is returned.  When DEST-BUFFER is omitted or nil the default
buffer specified in `table-dest-buffer-name' is used.  In this case
the content of the default buffer is erased prior to the generation.
When DEST-BUFFER is non-nil it is expected to be either a destination

(fn FROM TO)<a name="sort-regexp-fields"></a>
<h3>Function: sort-regexp-fields</h3>
Sort the text in the region region lexicographically.
If called interactively, prompt for two regular expressions,
RECORD-REGEXP and KEY-REGEXP.</p>
<p>
RECORD-REGEXP specifies the textual units to be sorted.
  For example, to sort lines, RECORD-REGEXP would be "^.*$".</p>
<p>
KEY-REGEXP specifies the part of each record (i.e. each match for
  RECORD-REGEXP) to be used for sorting.
  If it is "\\digit", use the digit'th "\\(...\\)"
  match field specified by RECORD-REGEXP.
  If it is "\\&", use the whole record.
  Otherwise, KEY-REGEXP should be a regular expression with which
  to search within the record.  If a match for KEY-REGEXP is not
  found within a record, that record is ignored.</p>
<p>
With a negative prefix arg, sort in reverse order.</p>
<p>
The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects
the sort order.</p>
<p>
For example: to sort lines in the region by the first word on each line
 starting with the letter "f",
 RECORD-REGEXP would be "^.*$" and KEY would be "\\<f\\w*\\>"</p>
<p>
(fn REVERSE RECORD-REGEXP KEY-REGEXP BEG END)<a name="find-variable-other-window"></a>
<h3>Function: find-variable-other-window</h3>

<p>
(fn)<a name="button-get"></a>
<h3>Function: button-get</h3>
Get the property of button BUTTON named PROP.<a name="fontset-font"></a>
<h3>Function: fontset-font</h3>
Return a font name pattern for character CH in fontset NAME.
If NAME is t, find a pattern in the default fontset.
If NAME is nil, find a pattern in the fontset of the selected frame.</p>
<p>
The value has the form (FAMILY . REGISTRY), where FAMILY is a font
family name and REGISTRY is a font registry name.  This is actually
the first font name pattern for CH in the fontset or in the default
fontset.</p>
<p>
If the 2nd optional arg ALL is non-nil, return a list of all font name
patterns.</p>
<p>
(fn NAME CH &optional ALL)<a name="insert-file-contents"></a>
<h3>Function: insert-file-contents</h3>
Insert contents of file FILENAME after point.
Returns list of absolute file name and number of characters inserted.
If second argument VISIT is non-nil, the buffer's visited filename and
last save file modtime are set, and it is marked unmodified.  If
visiting and the file does not exist, visiting is completed before the
error is signaled.</p>
<p>
The optional third and fourth arguments BEG and END specify what portion
of the file to insert.  These arguments count bytes in the file, not
characters in the buffer.  If VISIT is non-nil, BEG and END must be nil.</p>
<p>
If optional fifth argument REPLACE is non-nil, replace the current
buffer contents (in the accessible portion) with the file contents.
This is better than simply deleting and inserting the whole thing
because (1) it preserves some marker positions and (2) it puts less data
in the undo list.  When REPLACE is non-nil, the second return value is
the number of characters that replace previous buffer contents.</p>
<p>
This function does code conversion according to the value of
`coding-system-for-read' or `file-coding-system-alist', and sets the
variable `last-coding-system-used' to the coding system actually used.</p>
<p>
In addition, this function decodes the inserted text from known formats
by calling `format-decode', which see.</p>

<p>
(fn TOPIC &optional RECENT-KEYS)<a name="window-line-height"></a>
<h3>Function: window-line-height</h3>
Return height in pixels of text line LINE in window WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
Return height of current line if LINE is omitted or nil.  Return height of
header or mode line if LINE is `header-line' or `mode-line'.
Otherwise, LINE is a text line number starting from 0.  A negative number
counts from the end of the window.</p>
<p>
Value is a list (HEIGHT VPOS YPOS OFFBOT), where HEIGHT is the height
in pixels of the visible part of the line, VPOS and YPOS are the
vertical position in lines and pixels of the line, relative to the top
of the first text line, and OFFBOT is the number of off-window pixels at
the bottom of the text line.  If there are off-window pixels at the top
of the (first) text line, YPOS is negative.</p>
<p>
Return nil if window display is not up-to-date.  In that case, use
`pos-visible-in-window-p' to obtain the information.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional LINE WINDOW)<a name="selected-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: selected-frame</h3>

(fn)<a name="custom-set-default"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-set-default</h3>
Default :set function for a customizable variable.
Normally, this sets the default value of VARIABLE to VALUE,
but if `custom-local-buffer' is non-nil,
this sets the local binding in that buffer instead.<a name="eieio-defgeneric-reset-generic-form-primary-only"></a>
<h3>Function: eieio-defgeneric-reset-generic-form-primary-only</h3>

<h3>Function: turn-on-flyspell</h3>
Unconditionally turn on Flyspell mode.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="text-scale-adjust"></a>
<h3>Function: text-scale-adjust</h3>
Adjust the height of the default face by INC.</p>
<p>
INC may be passed as a numeric prefix argument.</p>
<p>
The actual adjustment made depends on the final component of the
key-binding used to invoke the command, with all modifiers removed:</p>
<p>
   +, =   Increase the default face height by one step
   -      Decrease the default face height by one step
   0      Reset the default face height to the global default</p>
<p>
When adjusting with `+' or `-', continue to read input events and
further adjust the face height as long as the input event read
(with all modifiers removed) is `+' or `-'.</p>
<p>
When adjusting with `0', immediately finish.</p>
<p>
Each step scales the height of the default face by the variable
`text-scale-mode-step' (a negative number of steps decreases the
height by the same amount).  As a special case, an argument of 0
will remove any scaling currently active.</p>
<p>
This command is a special-purpose wrapper around the
`text-scale-increase' command which makes repetition convenient
even when it is bound in a non-top-level keymap.  For binding in
a top-level keymap, `text-scale-increase' or
`text-scale-decrease' may be more appropriate.</p>
<p>
(fn INC)<a name="substitute-env-vars"></a>
<h3>Function: substitute-env-vars</h3>
Substitute environment variables referred to in STRING.
`$FOO' where FOO is an environment variable name means to substitute
the value of that variable.  The variable name should be terminated
with a character not a letter, digit or underscore; otherwise, enclose
the entire variable name in braces.  For instance, in `ab$cd-x',
`$cd' is treated as an environment variable.</p>
<p>
Use `$$' to insert a single dollar sign.<a name="cdr"></a>
<h3>Function: cdr</h3>
Return the cdr of LIST.  If arg is nil, return nil.
Error if arg is not nil and not a cons cell.  See also `cdr-safe'.</p>

<h3>Function: version</h3>
Return string describing the version of Emacs that is running.
If optional argument HERE is non-nil, insert string at point.
Don't use this function in programs to choose actions according
to the system configuration; look at `system-configuration' instead.<a name="overlay-recenter"></a>
<h3>Function: overlay-recenter</h3>
Recenter the overlays of the current buffer around position POS.
That makes overlay lookup faster for positions near POS (but perhaps slower
for positions far away from POS).</p>
<p>
(fn POS)<a name="flycheck-handle-idle-change"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-handle-idle-change</h3>

<h3>Function: checkdoc-start</h3>
Start scanning the current buffer for documentation string style errors.
Only documentation strings are checked.
Use `checkdoc-continue' to continue checking if an error cannot be fixed.
Prefix argument TAKE-NOTES means to collect all the warning messages into
a separate buffer.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional TAKE-NOTES)<a name="not-modified"></a>
<h3>Function: not-modified</h3>
Mark current buffer as unmodified, not needing to be saved.
With prefix ARG, mark buffer as modified, so C-x C-s will save.</p>
<p>
It is not a good idea to use this function in Lisp programs, because it
prints a message in the minibuffer.  Instead, use `set-buffer-modified-p'.<a name="rectangle-number-lines"></a>
<h3>Function: rectangle-number-lines</h3>
Insert numbers in front of the region-rectangle.</p>
<p>
START-AT, if non-nil, should be a number from which to begin
counting.  FORMAT, if non-nil, should be a format string to pass
to `format' along with the line count.  When called interactively
with a prefix argument, prompt for START-AT and FORMAT.</p>
<p>
(fn START END START-AT &optional FORMAT)<a name="scroll-bar-scale"></a>
<h3>Function: scroll-bar-scale</h3>
Given a pair (NUM . DENOM) and WHOLE, return (/ (* NUM WHOLE) DENOM).
This is handy for scaling a position on a scroll bar into real units,
like buffer positions.  If SCROLL-BAR-POS is the (PORTION . WHOLE) pair
from a scroll bar event, then (scroll-bar-scale SCROLL-BAR-POS
(buffer-size)) is the position in the current buffer corresponding to
that scroll bar position.<a name="flycheck-clear-idle-change-timer"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-clear-idle-change-timer</h3>

If you call this function interactively, you can give indicator which
is currently activated with completion.<a name="text-property-any"></a>
<h3>Function: text-property-any</h3>
Check text from START to END for property PROPERTY equaling VALUE.
If so, return the position of the first character whose property PROPERTY
is `eq' to VALUE.  Otherwise return nil.
If the optional fifth argument OBJECT is a buffer (or nil, which means
the current buffer), START and END are buffer positions (integers or
markers).  If OBJECT is a string, START and END are 0-based indices into it.</p>
<p>
(fn START END PROPERTY VALUE &optional OBJECT)<a name="call-process"></a>
<h3>Function: call-process</h3>
Call PROGRAM synchronously in separate process.
The remaining arguments are optional.
The program's input comes from file INFILE (nil means `/dev/null').
Insert output in BUFFER before point; t means current buffer; nil for BUFFER
 means discard it; 0 means discard and don't wait; and `(:file FILE)', where
 FILE is a file name string, means that it should be written to that file
 (if the file already exists it is overwritten).
BUFFER can also have the form (REAL-BUFFER STDERR-FILE); in that case,
REAL-BUFFER says what to do with standard output, as above,
while STDERR-FILE says what to do with standard error in the child.
STDERR-FILE may be nil (discard standard error output),
t (mix it with ordinary output), or a file name string.</p>
<p>
Fourth arg DISPLAY non-nil means redisplay buffer as output is inserted.
Remaining arguments are strings passed as command arguments to PROGRAM.</p>
<p>
If executable PROGRAM can't be found as an executable, `call-process'
signals a Lisp error.  `call-process' reports errors in execution of
the program only through its return and output.</p>
<p>
If BUFFER is 0, `call-process' returns immediately with value nil.
Otherwise it waits for PROGRAM to terminate
and returns a numeric exit status or a signal description string.
If you quit, the process is killed with SIGINT, or SIGKILL if you quit again.</p>
<p>
(fn PROGRAM &optional INFILE BUFFER DISPLAY &rest ARGS)<a name="visited-file-modtime"></a>
<h3>Function: visited-file-modtime</h3>
Return the current buffer's recorded visited file modification time.
The value is a list of the form (HIGH LOW USEC PSEC), like the time values that
`file-attributes' returns.  If the current buffer has no recorded file
modification time, this function returns 0.  If the visited file
doesn't exist, HIGH will be -1.
See Info node `(elisp)Modification Time' for more details.</p>

If this tar file was written by GNU tar, then you will be able to edit
the user id as a string; otherwise, you must edit it as a number.
You can force editing as a number by calling this with a prefix arg.
This does not modify the disk image; you must save the tar file itself
for this to be permanent.<a name="byte-optimize-identity"></a>

<h3>Function: mm-decompress-buffer</h3>
Decompress buffer's contents, depending on jka-compr.
Only when FORCE is t or `auto-compression-mode' is enabled and FILENAME
agrees with `jka-compr-compression-info-list', decompression is done.
Signal an error if FORCE is neither nil nor t and compressed data are
not decompressed because `auto-compression-mode' is disabled.
If INPLACE is nil, return decompressed data or nil without modifying
the buffer.  Otherwise, replace the buffer's contents with the
decompressed data.  The buffer's multibyteness must be turned off.<a name="comint-next-matching-input-from-input"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-next-matching-input-from-input</h3>

<h3>Function: customize-set-variable</h3>
Set the default for VARIABLE to VALUE, and return VALUE.
VALUE is a Lisp object.</p>
<p>
If VARIABLE has a `custom-set' property, that is used for setting
VARIABLE, otherwise `set-default' is used.</p>
<p>
If VARIABLE has a `variable-interactive' property, that is used as if
it were the arg to `interactive' (which see) to interactively read the value.</p>
<p>
If VARIABLE has a `custom-type' property, it must be a widget and the
`:prompt-value' property of that widget will be used for reading the value.</p>
<p>
If given a prefix (or a COMMENT argument), also prompt for a comment.<a name="x-list-fonts"></a>
<h3>Function: x-list-fonts</h3>
Return a list of the names of available fonts matching PATTERN.
If optional arguments FACE and FRAME are specified, return only fonts
the same size as FACE on FRAME.</p>
<p>
PATTERN should be a string containing a font name in the XLFD,
Fontconfig, or GTK format.  A font name given in the XLFD format may
contain wildcard characters:
  the * character matches any substring, and
  the ? character matches any single character.
  PATTERN is case-insensitive.</p>
<p>
The return value is a list of strings, suitable as arguments to
`set-face-font'.</p>
<p>
Fonts Emacs can't use may or may not be excluded
even if they match PATTERN and FACE.
The optional fourth argument MAXIMUM sets a limit on how many
fonts to match.  The first MAXIMUM fonts are reported.
The optional fifth argument WIDTH, if specified, is a number of columns
occupied by a character of a font.  In that case, return only fonts
the WIDTH times as wide as FACE on FRAME.</p>
<p>

number of elements needs to be refreshed.</p>
<p>
(fn EWOC)<a name="cl-nsubstitute-if"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-nsubstitute-if</h3>

(fn NEW PREDICATE SEQ [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="tooltip-process-prompt-regexp"></a>
<h3>Function: tooltip-process-prompt-regexp</h3>
Return regexp matching the prompt of PROCESS at the end of a string.
The prompt is taken from the value of `comint-prompt-regexp' in
the buffer of PROCESS.<a name="unify-8859-on-decoding-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: unify-8859-on-decoding-mode</h3>
Exists only for backwards compatibility.<a name="comint-send-input"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-send-input</h3>
Send input to process.
After the process output mark, sends all text from the process mark to
point as input to the process.  Before the process output mark, calls
value of variable `comint-get-old-input' to retrieve old input, copies
it to the process mark, and sends it.</p>
<p>
This command also sends and inserts a final newline, unless
NO-NEWLINE is non-nil.</p>
<p>
Any history reference may be expanded depending on the value of the variable
`comint-input-autoexpand'.  The list of function names contained in the value
of `comint-input-filter-functions' is called on the input before sending it.
The input is entered into the input history ring, if the value of variable
`comint-input-filter' returns non-nil when called on the input.</p>
<p>
If variable `comint-eol-on-send' is non-nil, then point is moved to the
end of line before sending the input.</p>
<p>
After the input has been sent, if `comint-process-echoes' is non-nil,
then `comint-send-input' waits to see if the process outputs a string
matching the input, and if so, deletes that part of the output.
If ARTIFICIAL is non-nil, it inhibits such deletion.
Callers sending input not from the user should use ARTIFICIAL = t.</p>
<p>
The values of `comint-get-old-input', `comint-input-filter-functions', and
`comint-input-filter' are chosen according to the command interpreter running
in the buffer.  E.g.,</p>
<p>
If the interpreter is the csh,
    `comint-get-old-input' is the default:
	If `comint-use-prompt-regexp' is nil, then
	either return the current input field, if point is on an input
	field, or the current line, if point is on an output field.
	If `comint-use-prompt-regexp' is non-nil, then
	return the current line with any initial string matching the
	regexp `comint-prompt-regexp' removed.
    `comint-input-filter-functions' monitors input for "cd", "pushd", and
	"popd" commands.  When it sees one, it cd's the buffer.
    `comint-input-filter' is the default: returns t if the input isn't all white
	space.</p>
<p>
If the Comint is Lucid Common Lisp,
    `comint-get-old-input' snarfs the sexp ending at point.
    `comint-input-filter-functions' does nothing.
    `comint-input-filter' returns nil if the input matches input-filter-regexp,
	which matches (1) all whitespace (2) :a, :c, etc.</p>
<p>
Similarly for Soar, Scheme, etc.</p>

If SPECIFIED-TIME is given, it is the time to convert to float
instead of the current time.  The argument should have the form
(HIGH LOW) or (HIGH LOW USEC) or (HIGH LOW USEC PSEC).  Thus,
you can use times from `current-time' and from `file-attributes'.
SPECIFIED-TIME can also have the form (HIGH . LOW), but this is
considered obsolete.</p>

Recognize a table cell that contains current point.
Probe the cell dimension and prepare the cell information.  The
optional two arguments FORCE and NO-COPY are for internal use only and
must not be specified.  When the optional numeric prefix argument ARG
is negative the cell becomes inactive, meaning that the cell becomes

<h3>Function: xml-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing XML.</p>
<p>
M-x nxml-finish-element finishes the current element by inserting an end-tag.
C-c C-i closes a start-tag with `>' and then inserts a balancing end-tag
leaving point between the start-tag and end-tag.
M-x nxml-balanced-close-start-tag-block is similar but for block rather than inline elements:
the start-tag, point, and end-tag are all left on separate lines.
If `nxml-slash-auto-complete-flag' is non-nil, then inserting a `</'
automatically inserts the rest of the end-tag.</p>
<p>
M-x completion-at-point performs completion on the symbol preceding point.</p>
<p>
M-x nxml-dynamic-markup-word uses the contents of the current buffer
to choose a tag to put around the word preceding point.</p>
<p>
Sections of the document can be displayed in outline form.  The
variable `nxml-section-element-name-regexp' controls when an element
is recognized as a section.  The same key sequences that change
visibility in outline mode are used except that they start with C-c C-o
instead of C-c.</p>
<p>
Validation is provided by the related minor-mode `rng-validate-mode'.
This also makes completion schema- and context- sensitive.  Element
names, attribute names, attribute values and namespace URIs can all be
completed. By default, `rng-validate-mode' is automatically enabled.
You can toggle it using M-x rng-validate-mode or change the default by
customizing `rng-nxml-auto-validate-flag'.</p>
<p>
TAB indents the current line appropriately.
This can be customized using the variable `nxml-child-indent'
and the variable `nxml-attribute-indent'.</p>
<p>
M-x nxml-insert-named-char inserts a character reference using
the character's name (by default, the Unicode name).
C-u M-x nxml-insert-named-char inserts the character directly.</p>
<p>
The Emacs commands that normally operate on balanced expressions will
operate on XML markup items.  Thus C-M-f will move forward
across one markup item; C-M-b will move backward across
one markup item; C-M-k will kill the following markup item;
C-M-@ will mark the following markup item.  By default, each
tag each treated as a single markup item; to make the complete element
be treated as a single markup item, set the variable
`nxml-sexp-element-flag' to t.  For more details, see the function
`nxml-forward-balanced-item'.</p>
<p>
M-x nxml-backward-up-element and M-x nxml-down-element move up and down the element structure.</p>

<h3>Function: toggle-text-mode-auto-fill</h3>
Toggle whether to use Auto Fill in Text mode and related modes.
This command affects all buffers that use modes related to Text mode,
both existing buffers and buffers that you subsequently create.<a name="font-lock-compile-keywords"></a>
<h3>Function: font-lock-compile-keywords</h3>
Compile KEYWORDS into the form (t KEYWORDS COMPILED...)
Here each COMPILED is of the form (MATCHER HIGHLIGHT ...) as shown in the
`font-lock-keywords' doc string.
If SYNTACTIC-KEYWORDS is non-nil, it means these keywords are used for
`font-lock-syntactic-keywords' rather than for `font-lock-keywords'.<a name="image-type-auto-detected-p"></a>
<h3>Function: image-type-auto-detected-p</h3>
Return t if the current buffer contains an auto-detectable image.
This function is intended to be used from `magic-fallback-mode-alist'.</p>
<p>
The buffer is considered to contain an auto-detectable image if
its beginning matches an image type in `image-type-header-regexps',
and that image type is present in `image-type-auto-detectable' with a
non-nil value.  If that value is non-nil, but not t, then the image type
must be available.<a name="truncated-partial-width-window-p"></a>
<h3>Function: truncated-partial-width-window-p</h3>
Return non-nil if lines in WINDOW are specifically truncated due to its width.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.
Return nil if WINDOW is not a partial-width window
 (regardless of the value of `truncate-lines').
Otherwise, consult the value of `truncate-partial-width-windows'
 for the buffer shown in WINDOW.<a name="pr-toggle-ghostscript"></a>

WINDOW can be any window and defaults to the selected one.
Return VALUE.</p>
<p>
(fn WINDOW PARAMETER VALUE)<a name="ispell-get-word"></a>
<h3>Function: ispell-get-word</h3>
Return the word for spell-checking according to ispell syntax.
If optional argument FOLLOWING is non-nil or if `ispell-following-word'
is non-nil when called interactively, then the following word
(rather than preceding) is checked when the cursor is not over a word.
Optional second argument contains otherchars that can be included in word
many times (see the doc string of `ispell-dictionary-alist' for details
about otherchars).</p>
<p>
Word syntax is controlled by the definition of the chosen dictionary,
which is in `ispell-local-dictionary-alist' or `ispell-dictionary-alist'.<a name="byte-compile-arglist-signature"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-compile-arglist-signature</h3></p>

<h3>Function: customize-rogue</h3>
Customize all user variables modified outside customize.<a name="change-log-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: change-log-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing change logs; like Indented Text mode.
Prevents numeric backups and sets `left-margin' to 8 and `fill-column' to 74.
New log entries are usually made with M-x add-change-log-entry or C-x 4 a.
Each entry behaves as a paragraph, and the entries for one day as a page.
Runs `change-log-mode-hook'.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `change-log-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

(fn)<a name="start-process-shell-command"></a>
<h3>Function: start-process-shell-command</h3>
Start a program in a subprocess.  Return the process object for it.
NAME is name for process.  It is modified if necessary to make it unique.
BUFFER is the buffer (or buffer name) to associate with the process.
 Process output goes at end of that buffer, unless you specify
 an output stream or filter function to handle the output.
 BUFFER may be also nil, meaning that this process is not associated
 with any buffer
COMMAND is the shell command to run.</p>
<p>
An old calling convention accepted any number of arguments after COMMAND,
which were just concatenated to COMMAND.  This is still supported but strongly
discouraged.<a name="not"></a>
<h3>Function: not</h3>
Return t if OBJECT is nil.</p>

(fn WIDGET)<a name="ispell-accept-buffer-local-defs"></a>
<h3>Function: ispell-accept-buffer-local-defs</h3>
Load all buffer-local information, restarting Ispell when necessary.<a name="find-composition"></a>
<h3>Function: find-composition</h3>
Return information about a composition at or near buffer position POS.</p>
<p>
If the character at POS has `composition' property, the value is a list
(FROM TO VALID-P).</p>
<p>
FROM and TO specify the range of text that has the same `composition'
property, VALID-P is t if this composition is valid, and nil if not.</p>
<p>
If there's no composition at POS, and the optional 2nd argument LIMIT
is non-nil, search for a composition toward the position given by LIMIT.</p>
<p>
If no composition is found, return nil.</p>
<p>
Optional 3rd argument STRING, if non-nil, is a string to look for a
composition in; nil means the current buffer.</p>
<p>
If a valid composition is found and the optional 4th argument DETAIL-P
is non-nil, the return value is a list of the form</p>
<p>
   (FROM TO COMPONENTS RELATIVE-P MOD-FUNC WIDTH)</p>
<p>
COMPONENTS is a vector of integers, the meaning depends on RELATIVE-P.</p>
<p>
RELATIVE-P is t if the composition method is relative, else nil.</p>
<p>
If RELATIVE-P is t, COMPONENTS is a vector of characters to be
composed.  If RELATIVE-P is nil, COMPONENTS is a vector of characters
and composition rules as described in `compose-region'.</p>
<p>
MOD-FUNC is a modification function of the composition.</p>
<p>
WIDTH is a number of columns the composition occupies on the screen.</p>
<p>
When Automatic Composition mode is on, this function also finds a
chunk of text that is automatically composed.  If such a chunk is
found closer to POS than the position that has `composition'
property, the value is a list of FROM, TO, and a glyph-string
that specifies how the chunk is to be composed.  See the function
`composition-get-gstring' for the format of the glyph-string.<a name="show-paren-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: show-paren-mode</h3>
Toggle visualization of matching parens (Show Paren mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Show Paren mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Show Paren mode is a global minor mode.  When enabled, any
matching parenthesis is highlighted in `show-paren-style' after
`show-paren-delay' seconds of Emacs idle time.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="posn-string"></a>
<h3>Function: posn-string</h3>
Return the string object of POSITION.
Value is a cons (STRING . STRING-POS), or nil if not a string.
POSITION should be a list of the form returned by the `event-start'
and `event-end' functions.<a name="delete-dups"></a>
<h3>Function: delete-dups</h3>
Destructively remove `equal' duplicates from LIST.
Store the result in LIST and return it.  LIST must be a proper list.
Of several `equal' occurrences of an element in LIST, the first
one is kept.<a name="controlling-tty-p"></a>
<h3>Function: controlling-tty-p</h3>
Return non-nil if TERMINAL is the controlling tty of the Emacs process.</p>
<p>
TERMINAL can be a terminal object, a frame, or nil (meaning the
selected frame's terminal).  This function always returns nil if
TERMINAL is not on a tty device.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional TERMINAL)<a name="widget-restricted-sexp-match"></a>
<h3>Function: widget-restricted-sexp-match</h3></p>
<p>

(fn WIDGET VALUE)<a name="ring-remove+insert+extend"></a>
<h3>Function: ring-remove+insert+extend</h3>
`ring-remove' ITEM from RING, then `ring-insert+extend' it.
This ensures that there is only one ITEM on RING.</p>
<p>
If the RING is full, behavior depends on GROW-P:
  If GROW-P is non-nil, enlarge the ring to accommodate the new ITEM.
  If GROW-P is nil, dump the oldest item to make room for the new.<a name="cookie-snarf"></a>
<h3>Function: cookie-snarf</h3>
Reads in the PHRASE-FILE, returns it as a vector of strings.
Emit STARTMSG and ENDMSG before and after.  Caches the result; second

<p>
(fn PHRASE-FILE STARTMSG ENDMSG)<a name="conf-space-keywords"></a>
<h3>Function: conf-space-keywords</h3>
Enter Conf Space mode using regexp KEYWORDS to match the keywords.
See `conf-space-mode'.</p>
<p>
(fn KEYWORDS)<a name="plain-TeX-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: plain-TeX-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing files of input for plain TeX.
Makes $ and } display the characters they match.
Makes " insert `` when it seems to be the beginning of a quotation,
and '' when it appears to be the end; it inserts " only after a \.</p>
<p>
Use M-x tex-region to run TeX on the current region, plus a "header"
copied from the top of the file (containing macro definitions, etc.),
running TeX under a special subshell.  M-x tex-buffer does the whole buffer.
M-x tex-file saves the buffer and then processes the file.
M-x tex-print prints the .dvi file made by any of these.
M-x tex-view previews the .dvi file made by any of these.
M-x tex-bibtex-file runs bibtex on the file of the current buffer.</p>
<p>
Use M-x tex-validate-buffer to check buffer for paragraphs containing
mismatched $'s or braces.</p>
<p>
Special commands:</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `plain-tex-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

Mode variables:
tex-run-command
	Command string used by M-x tex-region or M-x tex-buffer.
tex-directory
	Directory in which to create temporary files for TeX jobs
	run by M-x tex-region or M-x tex-buffer.
tex-dvi-print-command
	Command string used by M-x tex-print to print a .dvi file.
tex-alt-dvi-print-command
	Alternative command string used by M-x tex-print (when given a prefix
	argument) to print a .dvi file.
tex-dvi-view-command
	Command string used by M-x tex-view to preview a .dvi file.
tex-show-queue-command
	Command string used by M-x tex-show-print-queue to show the print
	queue that M-x tex-print put your job on.</p>
<p>
Entering Plain-tex mode runs the hook `text-mode-hook', then the hook
`tex-mode-hook', and finally the hook `plain-tex-mode-hook'.  When the
special subshell is initiated, the hook `tex-shell-hook' is run.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="set-language-environment"></a>
<h3>Function: set-language-environment</h3>
Set up multilingual environment for using LANGUAGE-NAME.
This sets the coding system priority and the default input method
and sometimes other things.  LANGUAGE-NAME should be a string
which is the name of a language environment.  For example, "Latin-1"
specifies the character set for the major languages of Western Europe.</p>
<p>
If there is a prior value for `current-language-environment', this
runs the hook `exit-language-environment-hook'.  After setting up
the new language environment, it runs `set-language-environment-hook'.<a name="package-menu-mark-delete"></a>
<h3>Function: package-menu-mark-delete</h3>
Mark a package for deletion and move to the next line.<a name="doc-view-mode-p"></a>
<h3>Function: doc-view-mode-p</h3>
Return non-nil if document type TYPE is available for `doc-view'.
Document types are symbols like `dvi', `ps', `pdf', or `odf' (any
OpenDocument format).</p>
<p>
(fn TYPE)<a name="key-binding"></a>
<h3>Function: key-binding</h3>
Return the binding for command KEY in current keymaps.
KEY is a string or vector, a sequence of keystrokes.
The binding is probably a symbol with a function definition.</p>
<p>
Normally, `key-binding' ignores bindings for t, which act as default
bindings, used when nothing else in the keymap applies; this makes it
usable as a general function for probing keymaps.  However, if the
optional second argument ACCEPT-DEFAULT is non-nil, `key-binding' does
recognize the default bindings, just as `read-key-sequence' does.</p>
<p>
Like the normal command loop, `key-binding' will remap the command
resulting from looking up KEY by looking up the command in the
current keymaps.  However, if the optional third argument NO-REMAP
is non-nil, `key-binding' returns the unmapped command.</p>
<p>
If KEY is a key sequence initiated with the mouse, the used keymaps
will depend on the clicked mouse position with regard to the buffer
and possible local keymaps on strings.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument POSITION is non-nil, it specifies a mouse
position as returned by `event-start' and `event-end', and the lookup
occurs in the keymaps associated with it instead of KEY.  It can also
be a number or marker, in which case the keymap properties at the
specified buffer position instead of point are used.</p>
<p>
(fn KEY &optional ACCEPT-DEFAULT NO-REMAP POSITION)<a name="html-ordered-list"></a>
<h3>Function: html-ordered-list</h3>
HTML ordered list tags.</p>
<p>
This is a skeleton command (see `skeleton-insert').
Normally the skeleton text is inserted at point, with nothing "inside".
If there is a highlighted region, the skeleton text is wrapped
around the region text.</p>
<p>
A prefix argument ARG says to wrap the skeleton around the next ARG words.
A prefix argument of -1 says to wrap around region, even if not highlighted.
A prefix argument of zero says to wrap around zero words---that is, nothing.
This is a way of overriding the use of a highlighted region.<a name="apropos-parse-pattern"></a>
<h3>Function: apropos-parse-pattern</h3>
Rewrite a list of words to a regexp matching all permutations.
If PATTERN is a string, that means it is already a regexp.
This updates variables `apropos-pattern', `apropos-pattern-quoted',
`apropos-regexp', `apropos-words', and `apropos-all-words-regexp'.<a name="widget-children-value-delete"></a>
<h3>Function: widget-children-value-delete</h3>
Delete all :children and :buttons in WIDGET.</p>
<p>
(fn WIDGET)<a name="backup-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: backup-buffer</h3>
Make a backup of the disk file visited by the current buffer, if appropriate.
This is normally done before saving the buffer the first time.</p>
<p>
A backup may be done by renaming or by copying; see documentation of
variable `make-backup-files'.  If it's done by renaming, then the file is
no longer accessible under its old name.</p>
<p>
The value is non-nil after a backup was made by renaming.
It has the form (MODES SELINUXCONTEXT BACKUPNAME).
MODES is the result of `file-modes' on the original
file; this means that the caller, after saving the buffer, should change
the modes of the new file to agree with the old modes.
SELINUXCONTEXT is the result of `file-selinux-context' on the original
file; this means that the caller, after saving the buffer, should change
the SELinux context of the new file to agree with the old context.
BACKUPNAME is the backup file name, which is the old file renamed.<a name="-split-with"></a>
<h3>Function: -split-with</h3>
Return a list of ((-take-while PRED LIST) (-drop-while PRED LIST)), in no more than one pass through the list.</p>
<p>
(fn PRED LIST)<a name="debugger-frame-number"></a>
<h3>Function: debugger-frame-number</h3>
Return number of frames in backtrace before the one point points at.<a name="syntax-propertize-multiline"></a>
<h3>Function: syntax-propertize-multiline</h3>
Let `syntax-propertize' pay attention to the syntax-multiline property.</p>
<p>
(fn BEG END)<a name="skeleton-pair-insert-maybe"></a>
<h3>Function: skeleton-pair-insert-maybe</h3>
Insert the character you type ARG times.</p>
<p>
With no ARG, if `skeleton-pair' is non-nil, pairing can occur.  If the region
is visible the pair is wrapped around it depending on `skeleton-autowrap'.
Else, if `skeleton-pair-on-word' is non-nil or we are not before or inside a
word, and if `skeleton-pair-filter-function' returns nil, pairing is performed.
Pairing is also prohibited if we are right after a quoting character
such as backslash.</p>
<p>
If a match is found in `skeleton-pair-alist', that is inserted, else
the defaults are used.  These are (), [], {}, <> and `' for the
symmetrical ones, and the same character twice for the others.</p>
<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="iimage-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: iimage-mode</h3>
Toggle Iimage mode on or off.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Iimage mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil, and toggle it if ARG is `toggle'.</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `iimage-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

(fn &optional ARG)<a name="gnus-group-split-fancy"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-group-split-fancy</h3>
Uses information from group parameters in order to split mail.
It can be embedded into `nnmail-split-fancy' lists with the SPLIT</p>
<p>
(: gnus-group-split-fancy GROUPS NO-CROSSPOST CATCH-ALL)</p>
<p>
GROUPS may be a regular expression or a list of group names, that will
be used to select candidate groups.  If it is omitted or nil, all
existing groups are considered.</p>
<p>
if NO-CROSSPOST is omitted or nil, a & split will be returned,
otherwise, a | split, that does not allow crossposting, will be
returned.</p>
<p>
For each selected group, a SPLIT is composed like this: if SPLIT-SPEC
is specified, this split is returned as-is (unless it is nil: in this
case, the group is ignored).  Otherwise, if TO-ADDRESS, TO-LIST and/or
EXTRA-ALIASES are specified, a regexp that matches any of them is
constructed (extra-aliases may be a list).  Additionally, if
SPLIT-REGEXP is specified, the regexp will be extended so that it
matches this regexp too, and if SPLIT-EXCLUDE is specified, RESTRICT
clauses will be generated.</p>
<p>
If CATCH-ALL is nil, no catch-all handling is performed, regardless of
catch-all marks in group parameters.  Otherwise, if there is no
selected group whose SPLIT-REGEXP matches the empty string, nor is
there a selected group whose SPLIT-SPEC is 'catch-all, this fancy
split (say, a group name) will be appended to the returned SPLIT list,
as the last element of a '| SPLIT.</p>
<p>
For example, given the following group parameters:</p>
<p>
nnml:mail.bar:
((to-address . "bar@femail.com")
 (split-regexp . ".*@femail\\.com"))
nnml:mail.foo:
((to-list . "foo@nowhere.gov")
 (extra-aliases "foo@localhost" "foo-redist@home")
 (split-exclude "bugs-foo" "rambling-foo")
 (admin-address . "foo-request@nowhere.gov"))
nnml:mail.others:
((split-spec . catch-all))</p>
<p>
Calling (gnus-group-split-fancy nil nil "mail.others") returns:</p>
<p>
(| (& (any "\\(bar@femail\\.com\\|.*@femail\\.com\\)"
	   "mail.bar")
      (any "\\(foo@nowhere\\.gov\\|foo@localhost\\|foo-redist@home\\)"
	   - "bugs-foo" - "rambling-foo" "mail.foo"))
   "mail.others")</p>
<p>
(fn &optional GROUPS NO-CROSSPOST CATCH-ALL)<a name="bookmark-insert"></a>
<h3>Function: bookmark-insert</h3>
Insert the text of the file pointed to by bookmark BOOKMARK-NAME.
BOOKMARK-NAME is a bookmark name (a string), not a bookmark record.</p>
<p>
You may have a problem using this function if the value of variable
`bookmark-alist' is nil.  If that happens, you need to load in some
bookmarks.  See help on function `bookmark-load' for more about
this.</p>

<h3>Function: accept-process-output</h3>
Allow any pending output from subprocesses to be read by Emacs.
It is read into the process' buffers or given to their filter functions.
Non-nil arg PROCESS means do not return until some output has been received
from PROCESS.</p>
<p>
Non-nil second arg SECONDS and third arg MILLISEC are number of seconds
and milliseconds to wait; return after that much time whether or not
there is any subprocess output.  If SECONDS is a floating point number,
it specifies a fractional number of seconds to wait.
The MILLISEC argument is obsolete and should be avoided.</p>
<p>
If optional fourth arg JUST-THIS-ONE is non-nil, only accept output
from PROCESS, suspending reading output from other processes.
If JUST-THIS-ONE is an integer, don't run any timers either.
Return non-nil if we received any output before the timeout expired.</p>

Return a pair (BUFFER . POINT) pointing to the definition of FUNCTION.</p>
<p>
Finds the source file containing the definition of FUNCTION
in a buffer and the point of the definition.  The buffer is
not selected.  If the function definition can't be found in
the buffer, returns (BUFFER).</p>
<p>
If FUNCTION is a built-in function, this function normally
attempts to find it in the Emacs C sources; however, if LISP-ONLY
is non-nil, signal an error instead.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: url-copy-file</h3>
Copy URL to NEWNAME.  Both args must be strings.
Signals a `file-already-exists' error if file NEWNAME already exists,
unless a third argument OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS is supplied and non-nil.
A number as third arg means request confirmation if NEWNAME already exists.
This is what happens in interactive use with M-x.
Fourth arg KEEP-TIME non-nil means give the new file the same
last-modified time as the old one.  (This works on only some systems.)
Fifth arg PRESERVE-UID-GID is ignored.
A prefix arg makes KEEP-TIME non-nil.</p>

<h3>Function: ffap</h3>
Find FILENAME, guessing a default from text around point.
If `ffap-url-regexp' is not nil, the FILENAME may also be an URL.
With a prefix, this command behaves exactly like `ffap-file-finder'.
If `ffap-require-prefix' is set, the prefix meaning is reversed.
See also the variables `ffap-dired-wildcards', `ffap-newfile-prompt',

A region is a dotted pair (FROM . TO).  Both parameters are lists of
regions.  Each list must contain nonoverlapping, noncontiguous
regions, in descending order.  The result is also nonoverlapping,
noncontiguous, and in descending order.  The first element of MINUEND
can have a cdr of nil, indicating that the end of that region is not
yet known.</p>
<p>
(fn MINUEND SUBTRAHEND)<a name="put-text-property"></a>
<h3>Function: put-text-property</h3>
Set one property of the text from START to END.
The third and fourth arguments PROPERTY and VALUE
specify the property to add.
If the optional fifth argument OBJECT is a buffer (or nil, which means
the current buffer), START and END are buffer positions (integers or
markers).  If OBJECT is a string, START and END are 0-based indices into it.</p>
<p>
(fn START END PROPERTY VALUE &optional OBJECT)<a name="tty-suppress-bold-inverse-default-colors"></a>
<h3>Function: tty-suppress-bold-inverse-default-colors</h3>
Suppress/allow boldness of faces with inverse default colors.
SUPPRESS non-nil means suppress it.
This affects bold faces on TTYs whose foreground is the default background
color of the display and whose background is the default foreground color.
For such faces, the bold face attribute is ignored if this variable
is non-nil.</p>
<p>
(fn SUPPRESS)<a name="ispell-looking-back"></a>
<h3>Function: ispell-looking-back</h3>
Return non-nil if text before point matches regular expression REGEXP.
Like `looking-at' except matches before point, and is slower.
LIMIT if non-nil speeds up the search by specifying a minimum
starting position, to avoid checking matches that would start
before LIMIT.</p>
<p>
If GREEDY is non-nil, extend the match backwards as far as
possible, stopping when a single additional previous character
cannot be part of a match for REGEXP.  When the match is
extended, its starting position is allowed to occur before
LIMIT.<a name="cl-rem"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-rem</h3>
The remainder of X divided by Y, with the same sign as X.</p>
<p>
(fn X Y)<a name="get-other-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: get-other-frame</h3>
Return some frame other than the current frame.
Create one if necessary.  Note that the minibuffer frame, if separate,
is not considered (see `next-frame').<a name="completion--twq-try"></a>
<h3>Function: completion--twq-try</h3></p>
<p>

(fn STRING USTRING COMPLETION POINT UNQUOTE REQUOTE)<a name="symbol-function"></a>
<h3>Function: symbol-function</h3>
Return SYMBOL's function definition.  Error if that is void.</p>
<p>
(fn SYMBOL)<a name="apropos-false-hit-symbol"></a>
<h3>Function: apropos-false-hit-symbol</h3>
Return t if SYMBOL is not really matched by the current keywords.<a name="ewoc--node-prev"></a>
<h3>Function: ewoc--node-prev</h3>
Return the node before NODE, or nil if NODE is the first node.</p>
<p>
(fn DLL NODE)<a name="gnus-delete-alist"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-delete-alist</h3>
Delete from ALIST all elements whose car is `eq' to KEY.
Return the modified alist.
Elements of ALIST that are not conses are ignored.<a name="undo-elt-in-region"></a>
<h3>Function: undo-elt-in-region</h3>
Determine whether UNDO-ELT falls inside the region START ... END.
If it crosses the edge, we return nil.<a name="kill-ring-save"></a>
<h3>Function: kill-ring-save</h3>
Save the region as if killed, but don't kill it.
In Transient Mark mode, deactivate the mark.
If `interprogram-cut-function' is non-nil, also save the text for a window
system cut and paste.</p>
<p>
If you want to append the killed line to the last killed text,
use C-M-w before M-w.</p>
<p>
This command is similar to `copy-region-as-kill', except that it gives
visual feedback indicating the extent of the region being copied.<a name="auto-revert-tail-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: auto-revert-tail-mode</h3>
Toggle reverting tail of buffer when the file grows.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Auto-Revert Tail mode if ARG
is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,
enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When Auto Revert Tail mode is enabled, the tail of the file is
constantly followed, as with the shell command `tail -f'.  This
means that whenever the file grows on disk (presumably because
some background process is appending to it from time to time),
this is reflected in the current buffer.</p>
<p>
You can edit the buffer and turn this mode off and on again as
you please.  But make sure the background process has stopped
writing before you save the file!</p>
<p>
Use `auto-revert-mode' for changes other than appends!</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="help-do-xref"></a>
<h3>Function: help-do-xref</h3>
Call the help cross-reference function FUNCTION with args ARGS.

a proper [back] button.<a name="eudc-display-generic-binary"></a>
<h3>Function: eudc-display-generic-binary</h3>
Display a button for unidentified binary DATA.</p>
<p>
(fn DATA)<a name="scroll-up"></a>
<h3>Function: scroll-up</h3>
Scroll text of selected window upward ARG lines.
If ARG is omitted or nil, scroll upward by a near full screen.
A near full screen is `next-screen-context-lines' less than a full screen.
Negative ARG means scroll downward.
If ARG is the atom `-', scroll downward by nearly full screen.
When calling from a program, supply as argument a number, nil, or `-'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="select-message-coding-system"></a>
<h3>Function: select-message-coding-system</h3>
Return a coding system to encode the outgoing message of the current buffer.
It at first tries the first coding system found in these variables
in this order:
  (1) local value of `buffer-file-coding-system'
  (2) value of `sendmail-coding-system'
  (3) value of `default-sendmail-coding-system'
  (4) default value of `buffer-file-coding-system'
If the found coding system can't encode the current buffer,
or none of them are bound to a coding system,
it asks the user to select a proper coding system.<a name="read-file-name-default"></a>
<h3>Function: read-file-name-default</h3>
Default method for reading file names.
See `read-file-name' for the meaning of the arguments.</p>

<h3>Function: face-inverse-video-p</h3>
Return non-nil if FACE specifies a non-nil inverse-video.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.<a name="user-original-login-name"></a>
<h3>Function: user-original-login-name</h3>
Return the name under which the user logged in, as a string.
This is based on the effective uid, not the real uid.
Also, if the environment variables LOGNAME or USER are set,
that determines the value of this function.</p>
<p>
If optional argument UID is an integer or a float, return the login name
of the user with that uid, or nil if there is no such user.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional UID)<a name="eval"></a>
<h3>Function: eval</h3>
Evaluate FORM and return its value.
If LEXICAL is t, evaluate using lexical scoping.</p>
<p>
(fn FORM &optional LEXICAL)<a name="substitute-in-file-name"></a>
<h3>Function: substitute-in-file-name</h3>
Substitute environment variables referred to in FILENAME.
`$FOO' where FOO is an environment variable name means to substitute
the value of that variable.  The variable name should be terminated
with a character not a letter, digit or underscore; otherwise, enclose
the entire variable name in braces.</p>
<p>
If `/~' appears, all of FILENAME through that `/' is discarded.
If `//' appears, everything up to and including the first of
those `/' is discarded.</p>
<p>
(fn FILENAME)<a name="-every?"></a>
<h3>Function: -every?</h3>
Return t if (PRED x) is non-nil for all x in LIST, else nil.</p>

<h3>Function: cl--set-substring</h3></p>
<p>

(fn STR START END VAL)<a name="timer-set-time"></a>
<h3>Function: timer-set-time</h3>
Set the trigger time of TIMER to TIME.
TIME must be in the internal format returned by, e.g., `current-time'.
If optional third argument DELTA is a positive number, make the timer
fire repeatedly that many seconds apart.<a name="sql-sqlite"></a>
<h3>Function: sql-sqlite</h3>
Run sqlite as an inferior process.</p>
<p>
SQLite is free software.</p>
<p>
If buffer `*SQL*' exists but no process is running, make a new process.
If buffer exists and a process is running, just switch to buffer
`*SQL*'.</p>
<p>
Interpreter used comes from variable `sql-sqlite-program'.  Login uses
the variables `sql-user', `sql-password', `sql-database', and
`sql-server' as defaults, if set.  Additional command line parameters
can be stored in the list `sql-sqlite-options'.</p>
<p>
The buffer is put in SQL interactive mode, giving commands for sending
input.  See `sql-interactive-mode'.</p>
<p>
To set the buffer name directly, use C-u
before M-x sql-sqlite.  Once session has started,
M-x sql-rename-buffer can be called separately to rename the
buffer.</p>
<p>
To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the input and output to the process, use C-x RET c
before M-x sql-sqlite.  You can also specify this with C-x RET p
in the SQL buffer, after you start the process.
The default comes from `process-coding-system-alist' and
`default-process-coding-system'.</p>
<p>
(Type C-h m in the SQL buffer for a list of commands.)</p>
<p>
(fn &optional BUFFER)<a name="byte-compile-no-warnings"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-compile-no-warnings</h3></p>
<p>

<p>
(fn)<a name="org-insert-columns-dblock"></a>
<h3>Function: org-insert-columns-dblock</h3>
Create a dynamic block capturing a column view table.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="autoarg-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: autoarg-mode</h3>
Toggle Autoarg mode, a global minor mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Autoarg mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `autoarg-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
In Autoarg mode, digits are bound to `digit-argument', i.e. they
supply prefix arguments as C-DIGIT and M-DIGIT normally do.
Furthermore, C-DIGIT inserts DIGIT.
M-x autoarg-terminate terminates the prefix sequence and inserts
the digits of the autoarg sequence into the buffer.
Without a numeric prefix arg, the normal binding of M-x autoarg-terminate
is invoked, i.e. what it would be with Autoarg mode off.</p>
<p>
For example:
`6 9 M-x autoarg-terminate' inserts `69' into the buffer, as does `C-6 C-9'.
`6 9 a' inserts 69 `a's into the buffer.
`6 9 M-x autoarg-terminate M-x autoarg-terminate' inserts `69' into the buffer and
then invokes the normal binding of M-x autoarg-terminate.
`C-u M-x autoarg-terminate' invokes the normal binding of M-x autoarg-terminate four times.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `autoarg-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

(fn &optional ARG)<a name="make-terminal-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: make-terminal-frame</h3>
Create an additional terminal frame, possibly on another terminal.
This function takes one argument, an alist specifying frame parameters.</p>
<p>
You can create multiple frames on a single text terminal, but only one
of them (the selected terminal frame) is actually displayed.</p>
<p>
In practice, generally you don't need to specify any parameters,
except when you want to create a new frame on another terminal.
In that case, the `tty' parameter specifies the device file to open,
and the `tty-type' parameter specifies the terminal type.  Example:</p>
<p>
   (make-terminal-frame '((tty . "/dev/pts/5") (tty-type . "xterm")))</p>
<p>
Note that changing the size of one terminal frame automatically
affects all frames on the same terminal device.</p>
<p>
(fn PARMS)<a name="custom-command-apply"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-command-apply</h3>
Call function FUN on all widgets in `custom-options'.
If there is more than one widget, ask user for confirmation using

(fn)<a name="help-for-help"></a>
<h3>Function: help-for-help</h3>
Help command.<a name="use-region-p"></a>
<h3>Function: use-region-p</h3>
Return t if the region is active and it is appropriate to act on it.
This is used by commands that act specially on the region under
Transient Mark mode.</p>
<p>
The return value is t if Transient Mark mode is enabled and the
mark is active; furthermore, if `use-empty-active-region' is nil,
the region must not be empty.  Otherwise, the return value is nil.</p>
<p>
For some commands, it may be appropriate to ignore the value of
`use-empty-active-region'; in that case, use `region-active-p'.<a name="display-popup-menus-p"></a>
<h3>Function: display-popup-menus-p</h3>
Return non-nil if popup menus are supported on DISPLAY.
DISPLAY can be a display name, a frame, or nil (meaning the selected
frame's display).
Support for popup menus requires that the mouse be available.<a name="search-forward-regexp"></a>
<h3>Function: search-forward-regexp</h3>
Search forward from point for regular expression REGEXP.
Set point to the end of the occurrence found, and return point.
An optional second argument bounds the search; it is a buffer position.
The match found must not extend after that position.
Optional third argument, if t, means if fail just return nil (no error).
  If not nil and not t, move to limit of search and return nil.
Optional fourth argument is repeat count--search for successive occurrences.</p>
<p>
Search case-sensitivity is determined by the value of the variable
`case-fold-search', which see.</p>
<p>
See also the functions `match-beginning', `match-end', `match-string',
and `replace-match'.</p>
<p>
(fn REGEXP &optional BOUND NOERROR COUNT)<a name="string-as-multibyte"></a>
<h3>Function: string-as-multibyte</h3>
Return a multibyte string with the same individual bytes as STRING.
If STRING is multibyte, the result is STRING itself.
Otherwise it is a newly created string, with no text properties.</p>
<p>
If STRING is unibyte and contains an individual 8-bit byte (i.e. not
part of a correct utf-8 sequence), it is converted to the corresponding
multibyte character of charset `eight-bit'.
See also `string-to-multibyte'.</p>
<p>
Beware, this often doesn't really do what you think it does.
It is similar to (decode-coding-string STRING 'utf-8-emacs).
If you're not sure, whether to use `string-as-multibyte' or
`string-to-multibyte', use `string-to-multibyte'.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: widget-choice-action</h3></p>
<p>

(fn WIDGET &optional EVENT)<a name="flycheck-add-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-add-mode</h3>
To CHECKER add a new major MODE.</p>
<p>
CHECKER and MODE are symbols denoting a syntax checker and a
major mode respectively.</p>
<p>
Add MODE to the `:modes' property of CHECKER, so that CHECKER
will be used in buffers with MODE.<a name="shell-script-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: shell-script-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing shell scripts.
This mode works for many shells, since they all have roughly the same syntax,
as far as commands, arguments, variables, pipes, comments etc. are concerned.
Unless the file's magic number indicates the shell, your usual shell is
assumed.  Since filenames rarely give a clue, they are not further analyzed.</p>
<p>
This mode adapts to the variations between shells (see `sh-set-shell') by
means of an inheritance based feature lookup (see `sh-feature').  This
mechanism applies to all variables (including skeletons) that pertain to
shell-specific features.</p>
<p>
The default style of this mode is that of Rosenblatt's Korn shell book.
The syntax of the statements varies with the shell being used.  The
following commands are available, based on the current shell's syntax:</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `sh-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
M-x sh-case	 case statement
M-x sh-for	 for loop
M-x sh-function	 function definition
M-x sh-if	 if statement
M-x sh-indexed-loop	 indexed loop from 1 to n
M-x sh-while-getopts	 while getopts loop
M-x sh-repeat	 repeat loop
M-x sh-select	 select loop
M-x sh-until	 until loop
M-x sh-while	 while loop</p>
<p>
For sh and rc shells indentation commands are:
M-x sh-show-indent	Show the variable controlling this line's indentation.
M-x sh-set-indent	Set then variable controlling this line's indentation.
M-x sh-learn-line-indent	Change the indentation variable so this line
would indent to the way it currently is.
M-x sh-learn-buffer-indent  Set the indentation variables so the
buffer indents as it currently is indented.</p>
<p>

M-x backward-delete-char-untabify	 Delete backward one position, even if it was a tab.
C-j	 Delete unquoted space and indent new line same as this one.
M-x sh-end-of-command	 Go to end of successive commands.
M-x sh-beginning-of-command	 Go to beginning of successive commands.
M-x sh-set-shell	 Set this buffer's shell, and maybe its magic number.
M-x sh-execute-region	 Have optional header and region be executed in a subshell.</p>
<p>
`sh-electric-here-document-mode' controls whether insertion of two
unquoted < insert a here document.</p>
<p>
If you generally program a shell different from your login shell you can
set `sh-shell-file' accordingly.  If your shell's file name doesn't correctly
indicate what shell it is use `sh-alias-alist' to translate.</p>
<p>
If your shell gives error messages with line numbers, you can use M-x executable-interpret
with your script for an edit-interpret-debug cycle.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="get-text-property"></a>
<h3>Function: get-text-property</h3>
Return the value of POSITION's property PROP, in OBJECT.

<p>
(fn TYPE SEQ1 SEQ2 PREDICATE [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="insert-text-button"></a>
<h3>Function: insert-text-button</h3>
Insert a button with the label LABEL.
The remaining arguments form a sequence of PROPERTY VALUE pairs,
specifying properties to add to the button.
In addition, the keyword argument :type may be used to specify a
button-type from which to inherit other properties; see
`define-button-type'.</p>
<p>
This function is like `insert-button', except that the button is
actually part of the text instead of being a property of the buffer.
Creating large numbers of buttons can also be somewhat faster using
`insert-text-button'.</p>
<p>
Also see `make-text-button'.<a name="provide-theme"></a>
<h3>Function: provide-theme</h3>
Indicate that this file provides THEME.

(fn)<a name="window--resize-child-windows"></a>
<h3>Function: window--resize-child-windows</h3>
Resize child windows of window PARENT vertically by DELTA lines.
PARENT must be a vertically combined internal window.</p>
<p>
Optional argument HORIZONTAL non-nil means resize child windows of
PARENT horizontally by DELTA columns.  In this case PARENT must
be a horizontally combined internal window.</p>
<p>
WINDOW, if specified, must denote a child window of PARENT that
is resized by DELTA lines.</p>
<p>
Optional argument IGNORE non-nil means ignore restrictions
imposed by fixed size windows, `window-min-height' or
`window-min-width' settings.  If IGNORE equals `safe', live
windows may get as small as `window-safe-min-height' lines and
`window-safe-min-width' columns.  If IGNORE is a window, ignore
restrictions for that window only.  Any other non-nil value means
ignore all of the above restrictions for all windows.</p>
<p>
Optional arguments TRAIL and EDGE, when non-nil, restrict the set
of windows that shall be resized.  If TRAIL equals `before',
resize only windows on the left or above EDGE.  If TRAIL equals
`after', resize only windows on the right or below EDGE.  Also,
preferably only resize windows adjacent to EDGE.</p>
<p>
Return the symbol `normalized' if new normal sizes have been
already set by this routine.<a name="coding-system-priority-list"></a>
<h3>Function: coding-system-priority-list</h3>

<p>
  (while (re-search-forward "foo[ \t]+bar" nil t)
    (replace-match "foobar" nil nil))</p>
<p>
which will run faster and probably do exactly what you want.  Please

<h3>Function: Info-mode</h3>
Info mode provides commands for browsing through the Info documentation tree.
Documentation in Info is divided into "nodes", each of which discusses
one topic and contains references to other nodes which discuss related
topics.  Info has commands to follow the references and show you other nodes.</p>
<p>
h	Invoke the Info tutorial.
q	Quit Info: reselect previously selected buffer.</p>
<p>
Selecting other nodes:
<mouse-2>
	Follow a node reference you click on.
	  This works with menu items, cross references, and
	  the "next", "previous" and "up", depending on where you click.
RET	Follow a node reference near point, like <mouse-2>.
n	Move to the "next" node of this node.
p	Move to the "previous" node of this node.
^	Move "up" from this node.
m	Pick menu item specified by name (or abbreviation).
	  Picking a menu item causes another node to be selected.
d	Go to the Info directory node.
<	Go to the Top node of this file.
>	Go to the final node in this file.
[	Go backward one node, considering all nodes as forming one sequence.
]	Go forward one node, considering all nodes as forming one sequence.
TAB	Move cursor to next cross-reference or menu item.
C-M-i	Move cursor to previous cross-reference or menu item.
f	Follow a cross reference.  Reads name of reference.
l	Move back in history to the last node you were at.
r	Move forward in history to the node you returned from after using l.
L	Go to menu of visited nodes.
T	Go to table of contents of the current Info file.</p>
<p>
Moving within a node:
SPC	Normally, scroll forward a full screen.
	  Once you scroll far enough in a node that its menu appears on the
	  screen but after point, the next scroll moves into its first
	  subnode.  When after all menu items (or if there is no menu),
	  move up to the parent node.
DEL	Normally, scroll backward.  If the beginning of the buffer is
	  already visible, try to go to the previous menu entry, or up
	  if there is none.
b	Go to beginning of node.</p>
<p>
Advanced commands:
s	Search through this Info file for specified regexp,
	  and select the node in which the next occurrence is found.
S	Search through this Info file for specified regexp case-sensitively.
C-s, C-M-s	Use Isearch to search through multiple Info nodes.
i	Search for a topic in this manual's Index and go to index entry.
,	(comma) Move to the next match from a previous i command.
I	Look for a string and display the index node with results.
M-x info-apropos	Look for a string in the indices of all manuals.
g	Move to node specified by name.
	  You may include a filename as well, as (FILENAME)NODENAME.
1 .. 9	Pick first ... ninth item in node's menu.
	  Every third `*' is highlighted to help pick the right number.
c	Put name of current Info node in the kill ring.
M-n	Select a new cloned Info buffer in another window.
C-u C-h i	Move to new Info file with completion.
C-u N C-h i	Select Info buffer with prefix number in the name *info*<N>.</p>

<h3>Function: comment-quote-re</h3></p>
<p>

(fn STR UNP)<a name="fringe-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: fringe-mode</h3>
Set the default appearance of fringes on all frames.
When called interactively, query the user for MODE; valid values
are `no-fringes', `default', `left-only', `right-only', `minimal'
and `half-width'.  See `fringe-styles'.</p>
<p>
When used in a Lisp program, MODE should be one of these:
- nil, which means the default width (8 pixels).
- a cons cell (LEFT . RIGHT), where LEFT and RIGHT are
  respectively the left and right fringe widths in pixels, or
  nil (meaning to disable that fringe).
- a single integer, which specifies the pixel widths of both
  fringes.
This command may round up the left and right width specifications
to ensure that their sum is a multiple of the character width of
a frame.  It never rounds up a fringe width of 0.</p>
<p>
Fringe widths set by `set-window-fringes' override the default
fringe widths set by this command.  This command applies to all
frames that exist and frames to be created in the future.  If you
want to set the default appearance of fringes on the selected
frame only, see the command `set-fringe-style'.<a name="jit-lock-refontify"></a>
<h3>Function: jit-lock-refontify</h3>
Force refontification of the region BEG..END (default whole buffer).<a name="ange-ftp-completion-hook-function"></a>
<h3>Function: ange-ftp-completion-hook-function</h3>
Provides support for ange-ftp host name completion.
Runs the usual ange-ftp hook, but only for completion operations.<a name="locate-library"></a>
<h3>Function: locate-library</h3>
Show the precise file name of Emacs library LIBRARY.
LIBRARY should be a relative file name of the library, a string.
It can omit the suffix (a.k.a. file-name extension) if NOSUFFIX is
nil (which is the default, see below).
This command searches the directories in `load-path' like `M-x load-library'
to find the file that `M-x load-library RET LIBRARY RET' would load.
Optional second arg NOSUFFIX non-nil means don't add suffixes `load-suffixes'
to the specified name LIBRARY.</p>
<p>
If the optional third arg PATH is specified, that list of directories
is used instead of `load-path'.</p>
<p>
When called from a program, the file name is normally returned as a
string.  When run interactively, the argument INTERACTIVE-CALL is t,
and the file name is displayed in the echo area.<a name="lm-code-mark"></a>
<h3>Function: lm-code-mark</h3>
Return the buffer location of the `Code' start marker.<a name="byte-optimize-lapcode"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-optimize-lapcode</h3>

<h3>Function: string-to-number</h3>
Parse STRING as a decimal number and return the number.
This parses both integers and floating point numbers.
It ignores leading spaces and tabs, and all trailing chars.</p>
<p>
If BASE, interpret STRING as a number in that base.  If BASE isn't
present, base 10 is used.  BASE must be between 2 and 16 (inclusive).
If the base used is not 10, STRING is always parsed as integer.</p>
<p>
(fn STRING &optional BASE)<a name="Buffer-menu-1-window"></a>
<h3>Function: Buffer-menu-1-window</h3>
Select this line's buffer, alone, in full frame.<a name="locate-with-filter"></a>
<h3>Function: locate-with-filter</h3>
Run the executable program `locate' with a filter.
This function is similar to the function `locate', which see.
The difference is that, when invoked interactively, the present function
prompts for both SEARCH-STRING and FILTER.  It passes SEARCH-STRING
to the locate executable program.  It produces a `*Locate*' buffer
that lists only those lines in the output of the locate program that
contain a match for the regular expression FILTER; this is often useful
to constrain a big search.</p>
<p>
ARG is the interactive prefix arg, which has the same effect as in `locate'.</p>
<p>
When called from Lisp, this function is identical with `locate',
except that FILTER is not optional.</p>
<p>
(fn SEARCH-STRING FILTER &optional ARG)<a name="dired-unmark"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-unmark</h3>

<h3>Function: conf-mode-maybe</h3>
Select Conf mode or XML mode according to start of file.<a name="cancel-timer"></a>
<h3>Function: cancel-timer</h3>
Remove TIMER from the list of active timers.<a name="mail-header-fold-field"></a>
<h3>Function: mail-header-fold-field</h3>
Fold the current header field.<a name="isearch-lazy-highlight-new-loop"></a>
<h3>Function: isearch-lazy-highlight-new-loop</h3>
Cleanup any previous `lazy-highlight' loop and begin a new one.
BEG and END specify the bounds within which highlighting should occur.
This is called when `isearch-update' is invoked (which can cause the
search string to change or the window to scroll).  It is also used
by other Emacs features.<a name="mouse-set-region"></a>
<h3>Function: mouse-set-region</h3>
Set the region to the text dragged over, and copy to kill ring.
This should be bound to a mouse drag event.
See the `mouse-drag-copy-region' variable to control whether this
command alters the kill ring or not.</p>
<p>
(fn CLICK)<a name="count-screen-lines"></a>
<h3>Function: count-screen-lines</h3>
Return the number of screen lines in the region.
The number of screen lines may be different from the number of actual lines,
due to line breaking, display table, etc.</p>
<p>
Optional arguments BEG and END default to `point-min' and `point-max'
respectively.</p>
<p>
If region ends with a newline, ignore it unless optional third argument
COUNT-FINAL-NEWLINE is non-nil.</p>
<p>
The optional fourth argument WINDOW specifies the window used for obtaining
parameters such as width, horizontal scrolling, and so on.  The default is
to use the selected window's parameters.</p>
<p>
Like `vertical-motion', `count-screen-lines' always uses the current buffer,
regardless of which buffer is displayed in WINDOW.  This makes possible to use
`count-screen-lines' in any buffer, whether or not it is currently displayed
in some window.<a name="version-list-<="></a>
<h3>Function: version-list-<=</h3>
Return t if L1, a list specification of a version, is lower or equal to L2.</p>
<p>
Note that integer list (1) is equal to (1 0), (1 0 0), (1 0 0 0),
etc.  That is, the trailing zeroes are insignificant.  Also, integer
list (1) is greater than (1 -1) which is greater than (1 -2)
which is greater than (1 -3).<a name="read-minibuffer"></a>
<h3>Function: read-minibuffer</h3>
Return a Lisp object read using the minibuffer, unevaluated.
Prompt with PROMPT.  If non-nil, optional second arg INITIAL-CONTENTS
is a string to insert in the minibuffer before reading.
(INITIAL-CONTENTS can also be a cons of a string and an integer.
Such arguments are used as in `read-from-minibuffer'.)</p>
<p>
(fn PROMPT &optional INITIAL-CONTENTS)<a name="eieio-eval-default-p"></a>
<h3>Function: eieio-eval-default-p</h3>
Whether the default value VAL should be evaluated for use.<a name="menu-bar-showhide-fringe-menu-customize-reset"></a>
<h3>Function: menu-bar-showhide-fringe-menu-customize-reset</h3>
Reset the fringe mode: display fringes on both sides of a window.<a name="whois-reverse-lookup"></a>
<h3>Function: whois-reverse-lookup</h3></p>
<p>

(fn)<a name="ediff-patch-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: ediff-patch-buffer</h3>
Run Ediff by patching the buffer specified at prompt.
Without the optional prefix ARG, asks if the patch is in some buffer and
prompts for the buffer or a file, depending on the answer.
With ARG=1, assumes the patch is in a file and prompts for the file.
With ARG=2, assumes the patch is in a buffer and prompts for the buffer.
PATCH-BUF is an optional argument, which specifies the buffer that contains the
patch. If not given, the user is prompted according to the prefix argument.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG PATCH-BUF)<a name="edebug-eval-top-level-form"></a>
<h3>Function: edebug-eval-top-level-form</h3>
Evaluate the top level form point is in, stepping through with Edebug.
This is like `eval-defun' except that it steps the code for Edebug
before evaluating it.  It displays the value in the echo area
using `eval-expression' (which see).</p>
<p>
If you do this on a function definition such as a defun or defmacro,
it defines the function and instruments its definition for Edebug,
so it will do Edebug stepping when called later.  It displays
`Edebug: FUNCTION' in the echo area to indicate that FUNCTION is now
instrumented for Edebug.</p>
<p>
If the current defun is actually a call to `defvar' or `defcustom',
evaluating it this way resets the variable using its initial value
expression even if the variable already has some other value.
(Normally `defvar' and `defcustom' do not alter the value if there
already is one.)</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="posn-object"></a>
<h3>Function: posn-object</h3>
Return the object (image or string) of POSITION.
Value is a list (image ...) for an image object, a cons cell
(STRING . STRING-POS) for a string object, and nil for a buffer position.
POSITION should be a list of the form returned by the `event-start'
and `event-end' functions.<a name="whitespace-newline-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: whitespace-newline-mode</h3>
Toggle newline visualization (Whitespace Newline mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Whitespace Newline mode if ARG
is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,
enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Use `whitespace-newline-mode' only for NEWLINE visualization
exclusively.  For other visualizations, including NEWLINE
visualization together with (HARD) SPACEs and/or TABs, please,
use `whitespace-mode'.</p>
<p>
See also `whitespace-newline' and `whitespace-display-mappings'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="pkg-info-library-original-version"></a>
<h3>Function: pkg-info-library-original-version</h3>
Get the original version in the header of LIBRARY.</p>
<p>
The original version is stored in the X-Original-Version header.
This header is added by the MELPA package archive to preserve
upstream version numbers.</p>
<p>
LIBRARY is either a symbol denoting a named feature, or a library
name as string.</p>
<p>
If SHOW is non-nil, show the version in the minibuffer.</p>
<p>
Return the version from the header of LIBRARY as list.  Signal an
error if the LIBRARY was not found or had no X-Original-Version
header.</p>
<p>
See Info node `(elisp)Library Headers' for more information
about library headers.</p>
<p>
(fn LIBRARY &optional SHOW)<a name="profiler-start"></a>
<h3>Function: profiler-start</h3>
Start/restart profilers.
MODE can be one of `cpu', `mem', or `cpu+mem'.
If MODE is `cpu' or `cpu+mem', time-based profiler will be started.
Also, if MODE is `mem' or `cpu+mem', then memory profiler will be started.</p>
<p>
(fn MODE)<a name="lao-transcribe-single-roman-syllable-to-lao"></a>
<h3>Function: lao-transcribe-single-roman-syllable-to-lao</h3>
Transcribe a Romanized Lao syllable in the region FROM and TO to Lao string.
Only the first syllable is transcribed.
The value has the form: (START END LAO-STRING), where
START and END are the beginning and end positions of the Roman Lao syllable,
LAO-STRING is the Lao character transcription of it.</p>
<p>
Optional 3rd arg STR, if non-nil, is a string to search for Roman Lao
syllable.  In that case, FROM and TO are indexes to STR.</p>
<p>
(fn FROM TO &optional STR)<a name="ido-find-file"></a>
<h3>Function: ido-find-file</h3>
Edit file with name obtained via minibuffer.
The file is displayed according to `ido-default-file-method' -- the
default is to show it in the same window, unless it is already
visible in another frame.</p>
<p>
The file name is selected interactively by typing a substring.  As you
type in a string, all of the filenames matching the string are displayed
if substring-matching is used (default).  Look at `ido-enable-prefix' and
`ido-toggle-prefix'.  When you have found the filename you want, it can
then be selected.  As you type, most keys have their normal keybindings,
except for the following: 
Uses keymap `ido-file-completion-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

RET Select the file at the front of the list of matches.  If the
list is empty, possibly prompt to create new file.</p>
<p>
M-x ido-select-text Use the current input string verbatim.</p>
<p>
M-x ido-next-match Put the first element at the end of the list.
M-x ido-prev-match Put the last element at the start of the list.
M-x ido-complete Complete a common suffix to the current string that
matches all files.  If there is only one match, select that file.
If there is no common suffix, show a list of all matching files
in a separate window.
M-x ido-magic-delete-char Open the specified directory in Dired mode.
M-x ido-edit-input Edit input string (including directory).
M-x ido-prev-work-directory or M-x ido-next-work-directory go to previous/next directory in work directory history.
M-x ido-merge-work-directories search for file in the work directory history.
M-x ido-forget-work-directory removes current directory from the work directory history.
M-x ido-prev-work-file or M-x ido-next-work-file cycle through the work file history.
M-x ido-wide-find-file-or-pop-dir and M-x ido-wide-find-dir-or-delete-dir prompts and uses find to locate files or directories.
M-x ido-make-directory prompts for a directory to create in current directory.
M-x ido-fallback-command Fallback to non-ido version of current command.
M-x ido-toggle-regexp Toggle regexp searching.
M-x ido-toggle-prefix Toggle between substring and prefix matching.
M-x ido-toggle-case Toggle case-sensitive searching of file names.
M-x ido-toggle-literal Toggle literal reading of this file.
M-x ido-completion-help Show list of matching files in separate window.
M-x ido-toggle-ignore Toggle ignoring files listed in `ido-ignore-files'.</p>

<p>
(fn START END)<a name="eieio-generic-call-primary-only"></a>
<h3>Function: eieio-generic-call-primary-only</h3>
Call METHOD with ARGS for methods with only :PRIMARY implementations.
ARGS provides the context on which implementation to use.
This should only be called from a generic function.</p>
<p>
This method is like `eieio-generic-call', but only
implementations in the :PRIMARY slot are queried.  After many
years of use, it appears that over 90% of methods in use
have :PRIMARY implementations only.  We can therefore optimize
for this common case to improve performance.<a name="ansi-color-freeze-overlay"></a>
<h3>Function: ansi-color-freeze-overlay</h3>
Prevent OVERLAY from being extended.
This function can be used for the `modification-hooks' overlay
property.<a name="gnus-convert-png-to-face"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-convert-png-to-face</h3>
Convert FILE to a Face.
FILE should be a PNG file that's 48x48 and smaller than or equal to
726 bytes.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE)<a name="dirtrack-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: dirtrack-mode</h3>
Toggle directory tracking in shell buffers (Dirtrack mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Dirtrack mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
This method requires that your shell prompt contain the current
working directory at all times, and that you set the variable
`dirtrack-list' to match the prompt.</p>
<p>
This is an alternative to `shell-dirtrack-mode', which works by
tracking `cd' and similar commands which change the shell working
directory.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="set-goal-column"></a>
<h3>Function: set-goal-column</h3>
Set the current horizontal position as a goal for C-n and C-p.
Those commands will move to this position in the line moved to
rather than trying to keep the same horizontal position.
With a non-nil argument ARG, clears out the goal column
so that C-n and C-p resume vertical motion.
The goal column is stored in the variable `goal-column'.<a name="po-find-file-coding-system"></a>
<h3>Function: po-find-file-coding-system</h3>
Return a (DECODING . ENCODING) pair, according to PO file's charset.
Called through `file-coding-system-alist', before the file is visited for real.</p>
<p>
(fn ARG-LIST)<a name="char-table-p"></a>
<h3>Function: char-table-p</h3>
Return t if OBJECT is a char-table.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT)<a name="seq-find"></a>
<h3>Function: seq-find</h3>
Return the first element for which (PREDICATE element) is non-nil in SEQUENCE.
If no element is found, return DEFAULT.</p>
<p>
Note that `seq-find' has an ambiguity if the found element is
identical to DEFAULT, as it cannot be known if an element was
found or not.</p>
<p>
(fn PREDICATE SEQUENCE &optional DEFAULT)<a name="list-load-path-shadows"></a>
<h3>Function: list-load-path-shadows</h3>
Display a list of Emacs Lisp files that shadow other files.</p>
<p>
If STRINGP is non-nil, returns any shadows as a string.
Otherwise, if interactive shows any shadows in a `*Shadows*' buffer;
else prints messages listing any shadows.</p>
<p>
This function lists potential load path problems.  Directories in
the `load-path' variable are searched, in order, for Emacs Lisp
files.  When a previously encountered file name is found again, a
message is displayed indicating that the later file is "hidden" by
the earlier.</p>
<p>
For example, suppose `load-path' is set to</p>
<p>
("/usr/gnu/emacs/site-lisp" "/usr/gnu/emacs/share/emacs/19.30/lisp")</p>
<p>
and that each of these directories contains a file called XXX.el.  Then
XXX.el in the site-lisp directory is referred to by all of:
(require 'XXX), (autoload .... "XXX"), (load-library "XXX") etc.</p>
<p>
The first XXX.el file prevents Emacs from seeing the second (unless
the second is loaded explicitly via `load-file').</p>
<p>
When not intended, such shadowings can be the source of subtle
problems.  For example, the above situation may have arisen because the
XXX package was not distributed with versions of Emacs prior to
19.30.  An Emacs maintainer downloaded XXX from elsewhere and installed
it.  Later, XXX was updated and included in the Emacs distribution.
Unless the Emacs maintainer checks for this, the new version of XXX
will be hidden behind the old (which may no longer work with the new
Emacs version).</p>
<p>
This function performs these checks and flags all possible
shadowings.  Because a .el file may exist without a corresponding .elc
(or vice-versa), these suffixes are essentially ignored.  A file
XXX.elc in an early directory (that does not contain XXX.el) is
considered to shadow a later file XXX.el, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>
Shadowings are located by calling the (non-interactive) companion
function, `load-path-shadows-find'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional STRINGP)<a name="rst-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: rst-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing reStructuredText documents.</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `rst-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

Turning on `rst-mode' calls the normal hooks `text-mode-hook'
and `rst-mode-hook'.  This mode also supports font-lock
highlighting.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `rst-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

(fn)<a name="align"></a>
<h3>Function: align</h3>
Attempt to align a region based on a set of alignment rules.
BEG and END mark the region.  If BEG and END are specifically set to
nil (this can only be done programmatically), the beginning and end of
the current alignment section will be calculated based on the location
of point, and the value of `align-region-separate' (or possibly each
rule's `separate' attribute).</p>
<p>
If SEPARATE is non-nil, it overrides the value of
`align-region-separate' for all rules, except those that have their
`separate' attribute set.</p>
<p>
RULES and EXCLUDE-RULES, if either is non-nil, will replace the
default rule lists defined in `align-rules-list' and
`align-exclude-rules-list'.  See `align-rules-list' for more details
on the format of these lists.</p>

<p>
(fn BUFFER-A BUFFER-B &optional STARTUP-HOOKS JOB-NAME)<a name="describe-face"></a>
<h3>Function: describe-face</h3>
Display the properties of face FACE on FRAME.
Interactively, FACE defaults to the faces of the character after point
and FRAME defaults to the selected frame.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.<a name="mark-whole-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: mark-whole-buffer</h3>
Put point at beginning and mark at end of buffer.
If narrowing is in effect, only uses the accessible part of the buffer.
You probably should not use this function in Lisp programs;
it is usually a mistake for a Lisp function to use any subroutine
that uses or sets the mark.<a name="get-language-info"></a>
<h3>Function: get-language-info</h3>
Return information listed under KEY for language environment LANG-ENV.
KEY is a symbol denoting the kind of information.
For a list of useful values for KEY and their meanings,

<h3>Function: set-mouse-position</h3>
Move the mouse pointer to the center of character cell (X,Y) in FRAME.
Coordinates are relative to the frame, not a window,
so the coordinates of the top left character in the frame
may be nonzero due to left-hand scroll bars or the menu bar.</p>
<p>
The position is given in character cells, where (0, 0) is the
upper-left corner of the frame, X is the horizontal offset, and Y is
the vertical offset.</p>
<p>
This function is a no-op for an X frame that is not visible.
If you have just created a frame, you must wait for it to become visible

<h3>Function: define-abbrev-table</h3>
Define TABLENAME (a symbol) as an abbrev table name.
Define abbrevs in it according to DEFINITIONS, which is a list of elements
of the form (ABBREVNAME EXPANSION ...) that are passed to `define-abbrev'.
PROPS is a property list to apply to the table.
Properties with special meaning:
- `:parents' contains a list of abbrev tables from which this table inherits
  abbreviations.
- `:case-fixed' non-nil means that abbreviations are looked up without
  case-folding, and the expansion is not capitalized/upcased.
- `:regexp' is a regular expression that specifies how to extract the
  name of the abbrev before point.  The submatch 1 is treated
  as the potential name of an abbrev.  If :regexp is nil, the default
  behavior uses `backward-word' and `forward-word' to extract the name
  of the abbrev, which can therefore only be a single word.
- `:enable-function' can be set to a function of no argument which returns
  non-nil if and only if the abbrevs in this table should be used for this
  instance of `expand-abbrev'.</p>

- FORM is a piece of Elisp code after macroexpansion.
- ENV is an alist mapping each enclosing lexical variable to its info.
   I.e. each element has the form (VAR . (READ MUTATED CAPTURED CALLED)).
This function does not return anything but instead fills the
`cconv-captured+mutated' and `cconv-lambda-candidates' variables
and updates the data stored in ENV.</p>

(fn FORM ENV)<a name="prefer-coding-system"></a>
<h3>Function: prefer-coding-system</h3>
Add CODING-SYSTEM at the front of the priority list for automatic detection.
This also sets the following coding systems:
  o coding system of a newly created buffer
  o default coding system for subprocess I/O
This also sets the following values:
  o default value used as `file-name-coding-system' for converting file names
  o default value for the command `set-terminal-coding-system'
  o default value for the command `set-keyboard-coding-system'</p>
<p>
If CODING-SYSTEM specifies a certain type of EOL conversion, the coding
systems set by this function will use that type of EOL conversion.</p>
<p>
A coding system that requires automatic detection of text+encoding
(e.g. undecided, unix) can't be preferred.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: map-y-or-n-p</h3>
Ask a series of boolean questions.
Takes args PROMPTER ACTOR LIST, and optional args HELP and ACTION-ALIST.</p>
<p>
LIST is a list of objects, or a function of no arguments to return the next
object or nil.</p>
<p>
If PROMPTER is a string, the prompt is (format PROMPTER OBJECT).  If not
a string, PROMPTER is a function of one arg (an object from LIST), which
returns a string to be used as the prompt for that object.  If the return
value is not a string, it may be nil to ignore the object or non-nil to act
on the object without asking the user.</p>
<p>
ACTOR is a function of one arg (an object from LIST),
which gets called with each object that the user answers `yes' for.</p>
<p>
If HELP is given, it is a list (OBJECT OBJECTS ACTION),
where OBJECT is a string giving the singular noun for an elt of LIST;
OBJECTS is the plural noun for elts of LIST, and ACTION is a transitive
verb describing ACTOR.  The default is ("object" "objects" "act on").</p>
<p>
At the prompts, the user may enter y, Y, or SPC to act on that object;
n, N, or DEL to skip that object; ! to act on all following objects;
ESC or q to exit (skip all following objects); . (period) to act on the
current object and then exit; or C-h to get help.</p>
<p>
If ACTION-ALIST is given, it is an alist (KEY FUNCTION HELP) of extra keys
that will be accepted.  KEY is a character; FUNCTION is a function of one
arg (an object from LIST); HELP is a string.  When the user hits KEY,
FUNCTION is called.  If it returns non-nil, the object is considered
"acted upon", and the next object from LIST is processed.  If it returns
nil, the prompt is repeated for the same object.</p>
<p>
Final optional argument NO-CURSOR-IN-ECHO-AREA non-nil says not to set
`cursor-in-echo-area' while prompting.</p>
<p>
This function uses `query-replace-map' to define the standard responses,
but not all of the responses which `query-replace' understands
are meaningful here.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: lax-plist-put</h3>
Change value in PLIST of PROP to VAL, comparing with `equal'.
PLIST is a property list, which is a list of the form
(PROP1 VALUE1 PROP2 VALUE2 ...).  PROP and VAL are any objects.
If PROP is already a property on the list, its value is set to VAL,
otherwise the new PROP VAL pair is added.  The new plist is returned;
use `(setq x (lax-plist-put x prop val))' to be sure to use the new value.
The PLIST is modified by side effects.</p>

the beginning of the result if column START-COLUMN appears in the
middle of a character in STR.</p>
<p>
If PADDING is nil, no padding is added in these cases, so
the resulting string may be narrower than END-COLUMN.</p>
<p>
If ELLIPSIS is non-nil, it should be a string which will replace the
end of STR (including any padding) if it extends beyond END-COLUMN,
unless the display width of STR is equal to or less than the display

It depends on `pr-print-using-ghostscript'.</p>
<p>
Interactively, the command prompts for N-UP printing number, a directory, a
file name regexp for matching and, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the
command prompts the user for a file name, and saves the PostScript image in
that file instead of saving it in a temporary file.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, if N-UP is nil, prompts for N-UP printing number.  If DIR is
nil, prompts for DIRectory.  If FILE-REGEXP is nil, prompts for
FILE(name)-REGEXP.  The argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it's nil,
save the image in a temporary file.  If FILENAME is a string, save the
PostScript image in a file with that name.  If FILENAME is t, prompts for a
file name.</p>

<h3>Function: read-input</h3>
Read a string from the minibuffer, prompting with string PROMPT.
If non-nil, second arg INITIAL-INPUT is a string to insert before reading.
  This argument has been superseded by DEFAULT-VALUE and should normally
  be nil in new code.  It behaves as in `read-from-minibuffer'.  See the
  documentation string of that function for details.
The third arg HISTORY, if non-nil, specifies a history list
  and optionally the initial position in the list.
See `read-from-minibuffer' for details of HISTORY argument.
Fourth arg DEFAULT-VALUE is the default value or the list of default values.
 If non-nil, it is used for history commands, and as the value (or the first
 element of the list of default values) to return if the user enters the
 empty string.
Fifth arg INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD, if non-nil, means the minibuffer inherits

<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="format-annotate-region"></a>
<h3>Function: format-annotate-region</h3>
Generate annotations for text properties in the region.
Search for changes between FROM and TO, and describe them with a list of
annotations as defined by alist TRANSLATIONS and FORMAT-FN.  IGNORE lists text
properties not to consider; any text properties that are neither ignored nor
listed in TRANSLATIONS are warned about.
If you actually want to modify the region, give the return value of this
function to `format-insert-annotations'.</p>
<p>
Format of the TRANSLATIONS argument:</p>
<p>
Each element is a list whose car is a PROPERTY, and the following
elements have the form (VALUE ANNOTATIONS...).
Whenever the property takes on the value VALUE, the annotations
(as formatted by FORMAT-FN) are inserted into the file.
When the property stops having that value, the matching negated annotation
will be inserted (it may actually be closed earlier and reopened, if
necessary, to keep proper nesting).</p>
<p>
If VALUE is a list, then each element of the list is dealt with
separately.</p>
<p>
If a VALUE is numeric, then it is assumed that there is a single annotation
and each occurrence of it increments the value of the property by that number.
Thus, given the entry (left-margin (4 "indent")), if the left margin
changes from 4 to 12, two <indent> annotations will be generated.</p>
<p>
If the VALUE is nil, then instead of annotations, a function should be
specified.  This function is used as a default: it is called for all
transitions not explicitly listed in the table.  The function is called with
two arguments, the OLD and NEW values of the property.  It should return
a cons cell (CLOSE . OPEN) as `format-annotate-single-property-change' does.</p>
<p>
The same TRANSLATIONS structure can be used in reverse for reading files.<a name="widget-image-find"></a>
<h3>Function: widget-image-find</h3>
Create a graphical button from IMAGE.
IMAGE should either already be an image, or be a file name sans

<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="ccl-execute"></a>
<h3>Function: ccl-execute</h3>
Execute CCL-PROGRAM with registers initialized by REGISTERS.</p>
<p>
CCL-PROGRAM is a CCL program name (symbol)
or compiled code generated by `ccl-compile' (for backward compatibility.
In the latter case, the execution overhead is bigger than in the former).
No I/O commands should appear in CCL-PROGRAM.</p>
<p>
REGISTERS is a vector of [R0 R1 ... R7] where RN is an initial value
for the Nth register.</p>
<p>
As side effect, each element of REGISTERS holds the value of
the corresponding register after the execution.</p>
<p>
See the documentation of `define-ccl-program' for a definition of CCL
programs.</p>
<p>
(fn CCL-PROG REG)<a name="gnus-frame-or-window-display-name"></a>

(fn WIDGET)<a name="gnus-agentize"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-agentize</h3>
Allow Gnus to be an offline newsreader.</p>
<p>
The gnus-agentize function is now called internally by gnus when
gnus-agent is set.  If you wish to avoid calling gnus-agentize,
customize gnus-agent to nil.</p>
<p>
This will modify the `gnus-setup-news-hook', and
`message-send-mail-real-function' variables, and install the Gnus agent
minor mode in all Gnus buffers.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="window-vscroll"></a>
<h3>Function: window-vscroll</h3>
Return the amount by which WINDOW is scrolled vertically.
If WINDOW is omitted or nil, it defaults to the selected window.

<p>
(fn &rest IGNORE)<a name="pr-ps-directory-preview"></a>
<h3>Function: pr-ps-directory-preview</h3>
Preview directory using ghostview.</p>
<p>
Interactively, the command prompts for N-UP printing number, a directory, a
file name regexp for matching and, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the
command prompts the user for a file name, and saves the PostScript image in
that file instead of saving it in a temporary file.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, if N-UP is nil, prompts for N-UP printing number.  If DIR is
nil, prompts for DIRectory.  If FILE-REGEXP is nil, prompts for
FILE(name)-REGEXP.  The argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it's nil,
save the image in a temporary file.  If FILENAME is a string, save the
PostScript image in a file with that name.  If FILENAME is t, prompts for a
file name.</p>
<p>
See also documentation for `pr-list-directory'.</p>

(fn S &optional ARG REFERENCE-BUFFER)<a name="serial-process-configure"></a>
<h3>Function: serial-process-configure</h3>
Configure speed, bytesize, etc. of a serial process.</p>
<p>
Arguments are specified as keyword/argument pairs.  Attributes that
are not given are re-initialized from the process's current
configuration (available via the function `process-contact') or set to
reasonable default values.  The following arguments are defined:</p>
<p>
:process PROCESS
:name NAME
:buffer BUFFER
:port PORT
-- Any of these arguments can be given to identify the process that is
to be configured.  If none of these arguments is given, the current
buffer's process is used.</p>
<p>
:speed SPEED -- SPEED is the speed of the serial port in bits per
second, also called baud rate.  Any value can be given for SPEED, but
most serial ports work only at a few defined values between 1200 and
115200, with 9600 being the most common value.  If SPEED is nil, the
serial port is not configured any further, i.e., all other arguments
are ignored.  This may be useful for special serial ports such as
Bluetooth-to-serial converters which can only be configured through AT
commands.  A value of nil for SPEED can be used only when passed
through `make-serial-process' or `serial-term'.</p>
<p>
:bytesize BYTESIZE -- BYTESIZE is the number of bits per byte, which
can be 7 or 8.  If BYTESIZE is not given or nil, a value of 8 is used.</p>
<p>
:parity PARITY -- PARITY can be nil (don't use parity), the symbol
`odd' (use odd parity), or the symbol `even' (use even parity).  If
PARITY is not given, no parity is used.</p>
<p>
:stopbits STOPBITS -- STOPBITS is the number of stopbits used to
terminate a byte transmission.  STOPBITS can be 1 or 2.  If STOPBITS
is not given or nil, 1 stopbit is used.</p>
<p>
:flowcontrol FLOWCONTROL -- FLOWCONTROL determines the type of
flowcontrol to be used, which is either nil (don't use flowcontrol),
the symbol `hw' (use RTS/CTS hardware flowcontrol), or the symbol `sw'
(use XON/XOFF software flowcontrol).  If FLOWCONTROL is not given, no
flowcontrol is used.</p>
<p>
`serial-process-configure' is called by `make-serial-process' for the
initial configuration of the serial port.</p>
<p>
Examples:</p>
<p>
(serial-process-configure :process "/dev/ttyS0" :speed 1200)</p>
<p>
(serial-process-configure
    :buffer "COM1" :stopbits 1 :parity 'odd :flowcontrol 'hw)</p>
<p>
(serial-process-configure :port "\\.\COM13" :bytesize 7)</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: ewoc-create</h3>
Create an empty ewoc.</p>
<p>
The ewoc will be inserted in the current buffer at the current position.</p>

PRETTY-PRINTER should be a function that takes one argument, an
element, and inserts a string representing it in the buffer (at
point).  The string PRETTY-PRINTER inserts may be empty or span
several lines.  The PRETTY-PRINTER should use `insert', and not
`insert-before-markers'.</p>
<p>
Optional second and third arguments HEADER and FOOTER are strings,
possibly empty, that will always be present at the top and bottom,
respectively, of the ewoc.</p>
<p>
Normally, a newline is automatically inserted after the header,
the footer and every node's printed representation.  Optional
fourth arg NOSEP non-nil inhibits this.</p>

<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="split-window-right"></a>
<h3>Function: split-window-right</h3>
Split the selected window into two side-by-side windows.
The selected window is on the left.  The newly split-off window
is on the right, and displays the same buffer.  Return the new
window.</p>
<p>
If optional argument SIZE is omitted or nil, both windows get the
same width, or close to it.  If SIZE is positive, the left-hand
(selected) window gets SIZE columns.  If SIZE is negative, the
right-hand (new) window gets -SIZE columns.  Here, SIZE includes
the width of the window's scroll bar; if there are no scroll
bars, it includes the width of the divider column to the window's
right, if any.<a name="flycheck-clear"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-clear</h3>
Clear all errors in the current buffer.</p>
<p>
With prefix arg or SHALL-INTERRUPT non-nil, also interrupt the
current syntax check.<a name="url-get-url-at-point"></a>
<h3>Function: url-get-url-at-point</h3>
Get the URL closest to point, but don't change position.
Has a preference for looking backward when not directly on a symbol.<a name="ring-previous"></a>
<h3>Function: ring-previous</h3>
Return the previous item in the RING, before ITEM.
Raise error if ITEM is not in the RING.<a name="setenv-internal"></a>
<h3>Function: setenv-internal</h3>

<h3>Function: custom-variable-save</h3>
Save value of variable edited by widget WIDGET.<a name="flycheck-c/c++-quoted-include-directory"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-c/c++-quoted-include-directory</h3>
Get the directory for quoted includes.</p>
<p>
C/C++ compiles typicall look up includes with quotation marks in
the directory of the file being compiled.  However, since
Flycheck uses temporary copies for syntax checking, it needs to
explicitly determine the directory for quoted includes.</p>
<p>
This function determines the directory by looking at function
`buffer-file-name', or if that is nil, at `default-directory'.<a name="unjustify-region"></a>
<h3>Function: unjustify-region</h3>
Remove justification whitespace from region.
For centered or right-justified regions, this function removes any indentation
past the left margin from each line.  For full-justified lines, it removes
extra spaces between words.  It does nothing in other justification modes.
Arguments BEGIN and END are optional; default is the whole buffer.<a name="table-recognize"></a>
<h3>Function: table-recognize</h3>
Recognize all tables within the current buffer and activate them.
Scans the entire buffer and recognizes valid table cells.  If the
optional numeric prefix argument ARG is negative the tables in the
buffer become inactive, meaning the tables become plain text and loses
all the table specific features.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="metamail-region"></a>
<h3>Function: metamail-region</h3>
Process current region through 'metamail'.
Optional argument VIEWMODE specifies the value of the
EMACS_VIEW_MODE environment variable (defaulted to 1).
Optional argument BUFFER specifies a buffer to be filled (nil
means current).
Optional argument NODISPLAY non-nil means buffer is not
redisplayed as output is inserted.</p>
<p>
(fn BEG END &optional VIEWMODE BUFFER NODISPLAY)<a name="apply-macro-to-region-lines"></a>
<h3>Function: apply-macro-to-region-lines</h3>
Apply last keyboard macro to all lines in the region.
For each line that begins in the region, move to the beginning of
the line, and run the last keyboard macro.</p>
<p>
When called from lisp, this function takes two arguments TOP and
BOTTOM, describing the current region.  TOP must be before BOTTOM.
The optional third argument MACRO specifies a keyboard macro to
execute.</p>
<p>
This is useful for quoting or unquoting included text, adding and
removing comments, or producing tables where the entries are regular.</p>
<p>
For example, in Usenet articles, sections of text quoted from another
author are indented, or have each line start with `>'.  To quote a
section of text, define a keyboard macro which inserts `>', put point
and mark at opposite ends of the quoted section, and use
`C-x C-k r' to mark the entire section.</p>
<p>
Suppose you wanted to build a keyword table in C where each entry
looked like this:</p>
<p>
    { "foo", foo_data, foo_function },
    { "bar", bar_data, bar_function },
    { "baz", baz_data, baz_function },</p>
<p>
You could enter the names in this format:</p>
<p>
    foo
    bar
    baz</p>
<p>
and write a macro to massage a word into a table entry:</p>
<p>
    \C-x (
       \M-d { "\C-y", \C-y_data, \C-y_function },
    \C-x )</p>
<p>
and then select the region of un-tablified names and use
`C-x C-k r' to build the table from the names.<a name="get-file-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: get-file-buffer</h3>
Return the buffer visiting file FILENAME (a string).
The buffer's `buffer-file-name' must match exactly the expansion of FILENAME.

typographic style information of a font, e.g. ``sans''.</p>
<p>
`:registry'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a string or a symbol specifying the charset registry and
encoding of a font, e.g. ``iso8859-1''.</p>
<p>
`:size'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a non-negative integer or a floating point number
specifying the font size.  It specifies the font size in pixels (if
VALUE is an integer), or in points (if VALUE is a float).</p>
<p>
`:name'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a string of XLFD-style or fontconfig-style font name.</p>
<p>
`:script'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a symbol representing a script that the font must
support.  It may be a symbol representing a subgroup of a script
listed in the variable `script-representative-chars'.</p>
<p>
`:lang'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a symbol of two-letter ISO-639 language names,
e.g. `ja'.</p>
<p>
`:otf'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a list (SCRIPT-TAG LANGSYS-TAG GSUB [ GPOS ]) to specify
required OpenType features.</p>
<p>
  SCRIPT-TAG: OpenType script tag symbol (e.g. `deva').
  LANGSYS-TAG: OpenType language system tag symbol,
     or nil for the default language system.
  GSUB: List of OpenType GSUB feature tag symbols, or nil if none required.
  GPOS: List of OpenType GPOS feature tag symbols, or nil if none required.</p>
<p>
GSUB and GPOS may contain `nil' element.  In such a case, the font
must not have any of the remaining elements.</p>
<p>
For instance, if the VALUE is `(thai nil nil (mark))', the font must
be an OpenType font whose GPOS table of `thai' script's default
language system must contain `mark' feature.</p>

(fn &optional ARG)<a name="remove-text-properties"></a>
<h3>Function: remove-text-properties</h3>
Remove some properties from text from START to END.
The third argument PROPERTIES is a property list
whose property names specify the properties to remove.
(The values stored in PROPERTIES are ignored.)
If the optional fourth argument OBJECT is a buffer (or nil, which means
the current buffer), START and END are buffer positions (integers or
markers).  If OBJECT is a string, START and END are 0-based indices into it.
Return t if any property was actually removed, nil otherwise.</p>
<p>
Use `set-text-properties' if you want to remove all text properties.</p>
<p>

(fn)<a name="window--resizable"></a>
<h3>Function: window--resizable</h3>
Return DELTA if WINDOW can be resized vertically by DELTA lines.
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.
Optional argument HORIZONTAL non-nil means return DELTA if WINDOW
can be resized horizontally by DELTA columns.  A return value of
zero means that WINDOW is not resizable.</p>
<p>
DELTA positive means WINDOW shall be enlarged by DELTA lines or
columns.  If WINDOW cannot be enlarged by DELTA lines or columns,
return the maximum value in the range 0..DELTA by which WINDOW
can be enlarged.</p>
<p>
DELTA negative means WINDOW shall be shrunk by -DELTA lines or
columns.  If WINDOW cannot be shrunk by -DELTA lines or columns,
return the minimum value in the range DELTA..0 that can be used
for shrinking WINDOW.</p>
<p>
Optional argument IGNORE non-nil means ignore restrictions
imposed by fixed size windows, `window-min-height' or
`window-min-width' settings.  If IGNORE is a window, ignore
restrictions for that window only.  If IGNORE equals `safe',
live windows may get as small as `window-safe-min-height' lines
and `window-safe-min-width' columns.  Any other non-nil value

<h3>Function: byte-compile-lambda</h3>
Byte-compile a lambda-expression and return a valid function.
The value is usually a compiled function but may be the original
lambda-expression.
When ADD-LAMBDA is non-nil, the symbol `lambda' is added as head
of the list FUN and `byte-compile-set-symbol-position' is not called.
Use this feature to avoid calling `byte-compile-set-symbol-position'
for symbols generated by the byte compiler itself.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: make-translation-table</h3>
Make a translation table from arguments.
A translation table is a char table intended for character
translation in CCL programs.</p>
<p>
Each argument is a list of elements of the form (FROM . TO), where FROM
is a character to be translated to TO.</p>
<p>
The arguments and forms in each argument are processed in the given
order, and if a previous form already translates TO to some other
character, say TO-ALT, FROM is also translated to TO-ALT.<a name="subregexp-context-p"></a>
<h3>Function: subregexp-context-p</h3>
Return non-nil if POS is in a normal subregexp context in REGEXP.
A subregexp context is one where a sub-regexp can appear.
A non-subregexp context is for example within brackets, or within a
repetition bounds operator `\{...\}', or right after a `\'.
If START is non-nil, it should be a position in REGEXP, smaller
than POS, and known to be in a subregexp context.<a name="Buffer-menu-view"></a>

<p>
(fn LIST PREDICATE)<a name="dash--match-kv-1"></a>
<h3>Function: dash--match-kv-1</h3>
Match MATCH-FORM against SOURCE of type TYPE.</p>
<p>
MATCH-FORM is a proper list of the form (key1 place1 ... keyN
placeN).  Each placeK is either a symbol, which gets bound to the
value of keyK retrieved from the key-value store, or another
match form which gets destructured recursively.</p>
<p>
SOURCE is a key-value store of type TYPE, which can be a plist,
an alist or a hash table.</p>

<p>
This stores EXP (without evaluating it) as the saved value for SYMBOL.
If NOW is present and non-nil, then also evaluate EXP and set
the default value for the SYMBOL to the value of EXP.</p>
<p>
REQUEST is a list of features we must require in order to
handle SYMBOL properly.
COMMENT is a comment string about SYMBOL.<a name="make-progress-reporter"></a>
<h3>Function: make-progress-reporter</h3>
Return progress reporter object for use with `progress-reporter-update'.</p>
<p>
MESSAGE is shown in the echo area, with a status indicator
appended to the end.  When you call `progress-reporter-done', the
word "done" is printed after the MESSAGE.  You can change the
MESSAGE of an existing progress reporter by calling
`progress-reporter-force-update'.</p>
<p>
MIN-VALUE and MAX-VALUE, if non-nil, are starting (0% complete)
and final (100% complete) states of operation; the latter should
be larger.  In this case, the status message shows the percentage
progress.</p>
<p>
If MIN-VALUE and/or MAX-VALUE is omitted or nil, the status
message shows a "spinning", non-numeric indicator.</p>
<p>
Optional CURRENT-VALUE is the initial progress; the default is
MIN-VALUE.
Optional MIN-CHANGE is the minimal change in percents to report;
the default is 1%.
CURRENT-VALUE and MIN-CHANGE do not have any effect if MIN-VALUE
and/or MAX-VALUE are nil.</p>
<p>
Optional MIN-TIME specifies the minimum interval time between
echo area updates (default is 0.2 seconds.)  If the function
`float-time' is not present, time is not tracked at all.  If the
OS is not capable of measuring fractions of seconds, this
parameter is effectively rounded up.<a name="minibuffer-completion-contents"></a>

<p>
(fn)<a name="gnus-float-time"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-float-time</h3>
Return the current time, as a float number of seconds since the epoch.
If SPECIFIED-TIME is given, it is the time to convert to float
instead of the current time.  The argument should have the form
(HIGH LOW) or (HIGH LOW USEC) or (HIGH LOW USEC PSEC).  Thus,
you can use times from `current-time' and from `file-attributes'.
SPECIFIED-TIME can also have the form (HIGH . LOW), but this is
considered obsolete.</p>
<p>
WARNING: Since the result is floating point, it may not be exact.
If precise time stamps are required, use either `current-time',
or (if you need time as a string) `format-time-string'.</p>

<h3>Function: dired-do-rename-regexp</h3>
Rename selected files whose names match REGEXP to NEWNAME.</p>
<p>
With non-zero prefix argument ARG, the command operates on the next ARG
files.  Otherwise, it operates on all the marked files, or the current
file if none are marked.</p>
<p>
As each match is found, the user must type a character saying
  what to do with it.  For directions, type C-h at that time.
NEWNAME may contain \<n> or \& as in `query-replace-regexp'.
REGEXP defaults to the last regexp used.</p>
<p>
With a zero prefix arg, renaming by regexp affects the absolute file name.
Normally, only the non-directory part of the file name is used and changed.<a name="tildify-region"></a>
<h3>Function: tildify-region</h3>
Add hard spaces in the region between BEG and END.

<p>
(fn BEG END)<a name="list-holidays"></a>
<h3>Function: list-holidays</h3>
Display holidays for years Y1 to Y2 (inclusive).
Y2 defaults to Y1.  The optional list of holidays L defaults to
`calendar-holidays'.  If you want to control what holidays are
displayed, use a different list.  For example,</p>
<p>
  (list-holidays 2006 2006
    (append holiday-general-holidays holiday-local-holidays))</p>
<p>
will display holidays for the year 2006 defined in the two

(fn &optional FORCE REPORT-IF-BOGUS)<a name="spam-initialize"></a>
<h3>Function: spam-initialize</h3>
Install the spam.el hooks and do other initialization.
When SYMBOLS is given, set those variables to t.  This is so you
can call `spam-initialize' before you set spam-use-* variables on
explicitly, and matters only if you need the extra headers
installed through `spam-necessary-extra-headers'.</p>
<p>
(fn &rest SYMBOLS)<a name="browse-url-cci"></a>
<h3>Function: browse-url-cci</h3>
Ask the XMosaic WWW browser to load URL.
Default to the URL around or before point.</p>
<p>
This function only works for XMosaic version 2.5 or later.  You must
select `CCI' from XMosaic's File menu, set the CCI Port Address to the
value of variable `browse-url-CCI-port', and enable `Accept requests'.</p>
<p>
When called interactively, if variable `browse-url-new-window-flag' is
non-nil, load the document in a new browser window, otherwise use a
random existing one.  A non-nil interactive prefix argument reverses
the effect of `browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
When called non-interactively, optional second argument NEW-WINDOW is
used instead of `browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
(fn URL &optional NEW-WINDOW)<a name="floor"></a>
<h3>Function: floor</h3>
Return the largest integer no greater than ARG.
This rounds the value towards -inf.

<h3>Function: rfc2047-encode-string</h3>
Encode words in STRING.
By default, the string is treated as containing addresses (see
`rfc2047-encoding-type').<a name="regexp-builder"></a>
<h3>Function: regexp-builder</h3>
Construct a regexp interactively.
This command makes the current buffer the "target" buffer of
the regexp builder.  It displays a buffer named "*RE-Builder*"
in another window, initially containing an empty regexp.</p>
<p>
As you edit the regexp in the "*RE-Builder*" buffer, the
matching parts of the target buffer will be highlighted.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: flycheck-overlays-in</h3>
Get all Flycheck overlays between BEG and END.<a name="mm-string-make-unibyte"></a>
<h3>Function: mm-string-make-unibyte</h3>
Return the unibyte equivalent of STRING.
Multibyte character codes are converted to unibyte according to
`nonascii-translation-table' or, if that is nil, `nonascii-insert-offset'.
If the lookup in the translation table fails, this function takes just
the low 8 bits of each character.</p>
<p>
(fn STRING)<a name="adjust-window-trailing-edge"></a>
<h3>Function: adjust-window-trailing-edge</h3>
Move WINDOW's bottom edge by DELTA lines.
Optional argument HORIZONTAL non-nil means move WINDOW's right
edge by DELTA columns.  WINDOW must be a valid window and
defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
If DELTA is greater than zero, move the edge downwards or to the
right.  If DELTA is less than zero, move the edge upwards or to
the left.  If the edge can't be moved by DELTA lines or columns,
move it as far as possible in the desired direction.<a name="backward-page"></a>
<h3>Function: backward-page</h3>
Move backward to page boundary.  With arg, repeat, or go fwd if negative.
A page boundary is any line whose beginning matches the regexp
`page-delimiter'.<a name="mm-encode-coding-region"></a>
<h3>Function: mm-encode-coding-region</h3>
Encode the current region by specified coding system.
When called from a program, takes four arguments:
        START, END, CODING-SYSTEM and DESTINATION.
START and END are buffer positions.</p>
<p>
Optional 4th arguments DESTINATION specifies where the encoded text goes.
If nil, the region between START and END is replace by the encoded text.
If buffer, the encoded text is inserted in that buffer after point (point
does not move).
In those cases, the length of the encoded text is returned.
If DESTINATION is t, the encoded text is returned.</p>
<p>
This function sets `last-coding-system-used' to the precise coding system
used (which may be different from CODING-SYSTEM if CODING-SYSTEM is
not fully specified.)</p>
<p>
(fn START END CODING-SYSTEM &optional DESTINATION)<a name="caaaar"></a>

With prefix argument KILL non-nil, kill the buffer instead of
burying it.</p>
<p>
According to information stored in WINDOW's `quit-restore' window
parameter either (1) delete WINDOW and its frame, (2) delete
WINDOW, (3) restore the buffer previously displayed in WINDOW,
or (4) make WINDOW display some other buffer than the present
one.  If non-nil, reset `quit-restore' parameter to nil.<a name="internal-describe-syntax-value"></a>
<h3>Function: internal-describe-syntax-value</h3>
Insert a description of the internal syntax description SYNTAX at point.</p>
<p>
(fn SYNTAX)<a name="executable-interpret"></a>
<h3>Function: executable-interpret</h3>

While script runs asynchronously, you can use the C-x `
command to find the next error.  The buffer is also in `comint-mode' and
`compilation-shell-minor-mode', so that you can answer any prompts.</p>
<p>
(fn COMMAND)<a name="file-relative-name"></a>
<h3>Function: file-relative-name</h3>
Convert FILENAME to be relative to DIRECTORY (default: `default-directory').
This function returns a relative file name which is equivalent to FILENAME
when used with that default directory as the default.

<h3>Function: holiday-list</h3>
Display holidays for years Y1 to Y2 (inclusive).
Y2 defaults to Y1.  The optional list of holidays L defaults to
`calendar-holidays'.  If you want to control what holidays are
displayed, use a different list.  For example,</p>
<p>
  (list-holidays 2006 2006
    (append holiday-general-holidays holiday-local-holidays))</p>
<p>
will display holidays for the year 2006 defined in the two
mentioned lists, and nothing else.</p>
<p>
When called interactively, this command offers a choice of
holidays, based on the variables `holiday-solar-holidays' etc.  See the
documentation of `calendar-holidays' for a list of the variables
that control the choices, as well as a description of the format
of a holiday list.</p>
<p>

<p>

(fn FORM A LIST &rest KEYS)<a name="ps-spool-region-with-faces"></a>
<h3>Function: ps-spool-region-with-faces</h3>
Generate a PostScript image of the region and spool locally.
Like `ps-spool-region', but includes font, color, and underline information in
the generated image.  This command works only if you are using a window system,
so it has a way to determine color values.</p>
<p>
Use the command `ps-despool' to send the spooled images to the printer.</p>
<p>
(fn FROM TO)<a name="find-file-other-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: find-file-other-frame</h3>
Edit file FILENAME, in another frame.</p>
<p>
Like C-x C-f (which see), but creates a new frame or reuses
an existing one.  See the function `display-buffer'.</p>
<p>
Interactively, the default if you just type RET is the current directory,
but the visited file name is available through the minibuffer history:
type M-n to pull it into the minibuffer.</p>
<p>
Interactively, or if WILDCARDS is non-nil in a call from Lisp,
expand wildcards (if any) and visit multiple files.<a name="ctext-post-read-conversion"></a>
<h3>Function: ctext-post-read-conversion</h3>
Decode LEN characters encoded as Compound Text with Extended Segments.<a name="custom-menu-filter"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-menu-filter</h3>

<p>
(fn N LIST)<a name="dired-add-entry"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-add-entry</h3>
Add a new dired entry for FILENAME.
Optionally mark it with MARKER-CHAR (a character, else uses
`dired-marker-char').  Note that this adds the entry `out of order'
if files are sorted by time, etc.
Skips files that match `dired-trivial-filenames'.
Exposes hidden subdirectories if a file is added there.</p>
<p>
If `dired-x' is loaded and `dired-omit-mode' is enabled, skips
files matching `dired-omit-regexp'.<a name="vc-git-working-revision"></a>

Return the value of CODING-SYSTEM's `post-read-conversion' property.<a name="dbus-message-internal"></a>
<h3>Function: dbus-message-internal</h3>
Send a D-Bus message.
This is an internal function, it shall not be used outside dbus.el.</p>
<p>
The following usages are expected:</p>
<p>
`dbus-call-method', `dbus-call-method-asynchronously':
  (dbus-message-internal

<p>
(fn &rest REST)<a name="try-completion"></a>
<h3>Function: try-completion</h3>
Return common substring of all completions of STRING in COLLECTION.
Test each possible completion specified by COLLECTION
to see if it begins with STRING.  The possible completions may be
strings or symbols.  Symbols are converted to strings before testing,
see `symbol-name'.
All that match STRING are compared together; the longest initial sequence
common to all these matches is the return value.
If there is no match at all, the return value is nil.
For a unique match which is exact, the return value is t.</p>
<p>
If COLLECTION is an alist, the keys (cars of elements) are the
possible completions.  If an element is not a cons cell, then the
element itself is the possible completion.
If COLLECTION is a hash-table, all the keys that are strings or symbols
are the possible completions.
If COLLECTION is an obarray, the names of all symbols in the obarray
are the possible completions.</p>
<p>
COLLECTION can also be a function to do the completion itself.
It receives three arguments: the values STRING, PREDICATE and nil.
Whatever it returns becomes the value of `try-completion'.</p>
<p>
If optional third argument PREDICATE is non-nil,
it is used to test each possible match.
The match is a candidate only if PREDICATE returns non-nil.
The argument given to PREDICATE is the alist element
or the symbol from the obarray.  If COLLECTION is a hash-table,
predicate is called with two arguments: the key and the value.
Additionally to this predicate, `completion-regexp-list'
is used to further constrain the set of candidates.</p>
<p>
(fn STRING COLLECTION &optional PREDICATE)<a name="flycheck-checker-at-point"></a>

Return non-nil if SPEC does not match VALUE.<a name="one-window-p"></a>
<h3>Function: one-window-p</h3>
Return non-nil if the selected window is the only window.
Optional arg NOMINI non-nil means don't count the minibuffer
even if it is active.  Otherwise, the minibuffer is counted
when it is active.</p>
<p>
Optional argument ALL-FRAMES specifies the set of frames to
consider, see also `next-window'.  ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted
means consider windows on the selected frame only, plus the
minibuffer window if specified by the NOMINI argument.  If the
minibuffer counts, consider all windows on all frames that share
that minibuffer too.  The remaining non-nil values of ALL-FRAMES
with a special meaning are:</p>
<p>
- t means consider all windows on all existing frames.</p>
<p>
- `visible' means consider all windows on all visible frames on
  the current terminal.</p>
<p>
- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible
  and iconified frames on the current terminal.</p>
<p>
- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.</p>
<p>
Anything else means consider all windows on the selected frame
and no others.<a name="flycheck-describe-checker"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-describe-checker</h3>
Display the documentation of CHECKER.</p>
<p>
CHECKER is a checker symbol.</p>
<p>
Pop up a help buffer with the documentation of CHECKER.<a name="view-file-other-window"></a>
<h3>Function: view-file-other-window</h3>
View FILE in View mode in another window.
When done, return that window to its previous buffer, and kill the
buffer visiting FILE if unmodified and if it wasn't visited before.</p>
<p>
Emacs commands editing the buffer contents are not available; instead,
a special set of commands (mostly letters and punctuation)
are defined for moving around in the buffer.
Space scrolls forward, Delete scrolls backward.
For a list of all View commands, type H or h while viewing.</p>
<p>
This command runs the normal hook `view-mode-hook'.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE)<a name="pr-despool-ps-print"></a>
<h3>Function: pr-despool-ps-print</h3>
Send the spooled PostScript to the printer or use ghostscript to print it.</p>
<p>
Interactively, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the
user for a file name, and saves the spooled PostScript image in that file
instead of sending it to the printer.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, the argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it is nil,
send the image to the printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save the PostScript
image in a file with that name.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FILENAME)<a name="icalendar-export-file"></a>
<h3>Function: icalendar-export-file</h3>
Export diary file to iCalendar format.
All diary entries in the file DIARY-FILENAME are converted to iCalendar
format.  The result is appended to the file ICAL-FILENAME.</p>

<h3>Function: idl-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing CORBA's IDL, PSDL and CIDL code.
To submit a problem report, enter `M-x c-submit-bug-report' from an
idl-mode buffer.  This automatically sets up a mail buffer with
version information already added.  You just need to add a description
of the problem, including a reproducible test case, and send the
message.</p>
<p>
To see what version of CC Mode you are running, enter `M-x c-version'.</p>
<p>
The hook `c-mode-common-hook' is run with no args at mode
initialization, then `idl-mode-hook'.</p>

Return all parents of CLASS in breadth-first order.<a name="multiple-value-list"></a>
<h3>Function: multiple-value-list</h3>
Return a list of the multiple values produced by EXPRESSION.
This handles multiple values in Common Lisp style, but it does not
work right when EXPRESSION calls an ordinary Emacs Lisp function
that returns just one value.</p>
<p>
(fn EXPRESSION)<a name="union"></a>
<h3>Function: union</h3>
Combine LIST1 and LIST2 using a set-union operation.
The resulting list contains all items that appear in either LIST1 or LIST2.
This is a non-destructive function; it makes a copy of the data if necessary
to avoid corrupting the original LIST1 and LIST2.</p>

Keywords supported:  :test :test-not :key</p>
<p>
(fn LIST1 LIST2 [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="eventp"></a>
<h3>Function: eventp</h3>
True if the argument is an event object.<a name="gnus-match-substitute-replacement"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-match-substitute-replacement</h3>
Return REPLACEMENT as it will be inserted by `replace-match'.
In other words, all back-references in the form `\&' and `\N'
are substituted with actual strings matched by the last search.
Optional FIXEDCASE, LITERAL, STRING and SUBEXP have the same
meaning as for `replace-match'.<a name="frame-face-alist"></a>
<h3>Function: frame-face-alist</h3>
Return an alist of frame-local faces defined on FRAME.
For internal use only.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FRAME)<a name="object-add-to-list"></a>
<h3>Function: object-add-to-list</h3>
In OBJECT's SLOT, add ITEM to the list of elements.
Optional argument APPEND indicates we need to append to the list.
If ITEM already exists in the list in SLOT, then it is not added.
Comparison is done with `equal' through the `member' function call.
If SLOT is unbound, bind it to the list containing ITEM.<a name="help-print-return-message"></a>
<h3>Function: help-print-return-message</h3>
Display or return message saying how to restore windows after help command.
This function assumes that `standard-output' is the help buffer.
It computes a message, and applies the optional argument FUNCTION to it.
If FUNCTION is nil, it applies `message', thus displaying the message.
In addition, this function sets up `help-return-method', which see, that
specifies what to do when the user exits the help buffer.<a name="undo-make-selective-list"></a>
<h3>Function: undo-make-selective-list</h3>
Return a list of undo elements for the region START to END.
The elements come from `buffer-undo-list', but we keep only
the elements inside this region, and discard those outside this region.
If we find an element that crosses an edge of this region,
we stop and ignore all further elements.<a name="completion--replace"></a>
<h3>Function: completion--replace</h3>
Replace the buffer text between BEG and END with NEWTEXT.
Moves point to the end of the new text.</p>

If there is neither a user setting nor a default for FACE, return nil.<a name="set-fill-column"></a>
<h3>Function: set-fill-column</h3>
Set `fill-column' to specified argument.
Use C-u followed by a number to specify a column.
Just C-u as argument means to use the current column.<a name="write-region"></a>
<h3>Function: write-region</h3>
Write current region into specified file.
When called from a program, requires three arguments:
START, END and FILENAME.  START and END are normally buffer positions
specifying the part of the buffer to write.
If START is nil, that means to use the entire buffer contents.
If START is a string, then output that string to the file
instead of any buffer contents; END is ignored.</p>
<p>
Optional fourth argument APPEND if non-nil means
  append to existing file contents (if any).  If it is an integer,
  seek to that offset in the file before writing.
Optional fifth argument VISIT, if t or a string, means
  set the last-save-file-modtime of buffer to this file's modtime
  and mark buffer not modified.
If VISIT is a string, it is a second file name;
  the output goes to FILENAME, but the buffer is marked as visiting VISIT.
  VISIT is also the file name to lock and unlock for clash detection.
If VISIT is neither t nor nil nor a string,
  that means do not display the "Wrote file" message.
The optional sixth arg LOCKNAME, if non-nil, specifies the name to
  use for locking and unlocking, overriding FILENAME and VISIT.
The optional seventh arg MUSTBENEW, if non-nil, insists on a check
  for an existing file with the same name.  If MUSTBENEW is `excl',
  that means to get an error if the file already exists; never overwrite.
  If MUSTBENEW is neither nil nor `excl', that means ask for
  confirmation before overwriting, but do go ahead and overwrite the file
  if the user confirms.</p>
<p>
This does code conversion according to the value of
`coding-system-for-write', `buffer-file-coding-system', or
`file-coding-system-alist', and sets the variable
`last-coding-system-used' to the coding system actually used.</p>
<p>
This calls `write-region-annotate-functions' at the start, and
`write-region-post-annotation-function' at the end.</p>

Semantic mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
In Semantic mode, Emacs parses the buffers you visit for their
semantic content.  This information is used by a variety of
auxiliary minor modes, listed in `semantic-default-submodes';
all the minor modes in this list are also enabled when you enable
Semantic mode.</p>

<p>
(fn)<a name="occur"></a>
<h3>Function: occur</h3>
Show all lines in the current buffer containing a match for REGEXP.
If a match spreads across multiple lines, all those lines are shown.</p>
<p>
Each line is displayed with NLINES lines before and after, or -NLINES
before if NLINES is negative.
NLINES defaults to `list-matching-lines-default-context-lines'.
Interactively it is the prefix arg.</p>
<p>
The lines are shown in a buffer named `*Occur*'.
It serves as a menu to find any of the occurrences in this buffer.
C-h m in that buffer will explain how.</p>
<p>
If REGEXP contains upper case characters (excluding those preceded by `\')
and `search-upper-case' is non-nil, the matching is case-sensitive.</p>
<p>
When NLINES is a string or when the function is called
interactively with prefix argument without a number (`C-u' alone
as prefix) the matching strings are collected into the `*Occur*'
buffer by using NLINES as a replacement regexp.  NLINES may
contain \& and \N which convention follows `replace-match'.
For example, providing "defun\s +\(\S +\)" for REGEXP and
"\1" for NLINES collects all the function names in a lisp
program.  When there is no parenthesized subexpressions in REGEXP
the entire match is collected.  In any case the searched buffer
is not modified.<a name="newline-and-indent"></a>
<h3>Function: newline-and-indent</h3>
Insert a newline, then indent according to major mode.
Indentation is done using the value of `indent-line-function'.

<h3>Function: substitute-command-keys</h3>
Substitute key descriptions for command names in STRING.
Each substring of the form \[COMMAND] is replaced by either a
keystroke sequence that invokes COMMAND, or "M-x COMMAND" if COMMAND
is not on any keys.</p>
<p>
Each substring of the form \{MAPVAR} is replaced by a summary of
the value of MAPVAR as a keymap.  This summary is similar to the one
produced by `describe-bindings'.  The summary ends in two newlines
(used by the helper function `help-make-xrefs' to find the end of the
summary).</p>
<p>
Each substring of the form \<MAPVAR> specifies the use of MAPVAR
as the keymap for future \[COMMAND] substrings.
\= quotes the following character and is discarded;
thus, \=\= puts \= into the output, and \=\[ puts \[ into the output.</p>

the `kbd-help' property at point.  If `kbd-help' does not produce
a string, but the `help-echo' property does, then that string is
printed instead.</p>
<p>
A numeric argument ARG prevents display of a message in case
there is no help.  While ARG can be used interactively, it is
mainly meant for use from Lisp.</p>

If they are in the windows's left or right marginal areas, `left-margin'
  or `right-margin' is returned.</p>
<p>
(fn COORDINATES WINDOW)<a name="-mapcat"></a>
<h3>Function: -mapcat</h3>
Return the concatenation of the result of mapping FN over LIST.
Thus function FN should return a list.</p>
<p>
(fn FN LIST)<a name="clipboard-kill-ring-save"></a>
<h3>Function: clipboard-kill-ring-save</h3>
Copy region to kill ring, and save in the X clipboard.<a name="isearch-yank-char-in-minibuffer"></a>
<h3>Function: isearch-yank-char-in-minibuffer</h3>
Pull next character from buffer into end of search string in minibuffer.<a name="vc-merge"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-merge</h3>
Perform a version control merge operation.
You must be visiting a version controlled file, or in a `vc-dir' buffer.
On a distributed version control system, this runs a "merge"
operation to incorporate changes from another branch onto the
current branch, prompting for an argument list.</p>
<p>
On a non-distributed version control system, this merges changes
between two revisions into the current fileset.  This asks for
two revisions to merge from in the minibuffer.  If the first
revision is a branch number, then merge all changes from that
branch.  If the first revision is empty, merge the most recent
changes from the current branch.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="sql-solid"></a>
<h3>Function: sql-solid</h3>
Run solsql by Solid as an inferior process.</p>
<p>
If buffer `*SQL*' exists but no process is running, make a new process.
If buffer exists and a process is running, just switch to buffer
`*SQL*'.</p>
<p>
Interpreter used comes from variable `sql-solid-program'.  Login uses
the variables `sql-user', `sql-password', and `sql-server' as
defaults, if set.</p>
<p>
The buffer is put in SQL interactive mode, giving commands for sending
input.  See `sql-interactive-mode'.</p>
<p>
To set the buffer name directly, use C-u
before M-x sql-solid.  Once session has started,
M-x sql-rename-buffer can be called separately to rename the
buffer.</p>
<p>
To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the input and output to the process, use C-x RET c
before M-x sql-solid.  You can also specify this with C-x RET p
in the SQL buffer, after you start the process.
The default comes from `process-coding-system-alist' and
`default-process-coding-system'.</p>
<p>
(Type C-h m in the SQL buffer for a list of commands.)</p>
<p>
(fn &optional BUFFER)<a name="scan-buf-next-region"></a>
<h3>Function: scan-buf-next-region</h3>
Go to the start of the next region with non-nil help-echo.
Print the help found there using `display-local-help'.  Adjacent
areas with different non-nil help-echo properties are considered
different regions.</p>
<p>
With numeric argument ARG, move to the start of the ARGth next
help-echo region.  If ARG is negative, move backward.  If point
is already in a help-echo region, then that region does not count
toward ARG.  If ARG is 0 and point is inside a help-echo region,
move to the start of that region.  If ARG is 0 and point is not
in such a region, just print a message to that effect.  If there
are not enough regions to move over, an error results and the
number of available regions is mentioned in the error message.</p>
<p>
A potentially confusing subtlety is that point can be in a
help-echo region without any local help being available.  This is
because `help-echo' can be a function evaluating to nil.  This
rarely happens in practice.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="ebnf-merge-style"></a>

<p>
(fn FORM)<a name="byte-compile-unbind"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-compile-unbind</h3>
Emit byte-codes to unbind the variables bound by CLAUSES.
CLAUSES is a `let'-style variable binding list.  INIT-LEXENV should be a
lexical-environment alist describing the positions of the init value that
have been pushed on the stack.  If PRESERVE-BODY-VALUE is true,
then an additional value on the top of the stack, above any lexical binding
slots, is preserved, so it will be on the top of the stack after all
binding slots have been popped.</p>
<p>
(fn CLAUSES INIT-LEXENV &optional PRESERVE-BODY-VALUE)<a name="make-backup-file-name-1"></a>
<h3>Function: make-backup-file-name-1</h3>
Subroutine of `make-backup-file-name' and `find-backup-file-name'.<a name="string-match"></a>
<h3>Function: string-match</h3>
Return index of start of first match for REGEXP in STRING, or nil.
Matching ignores case if `case-fold-search' is non-nil.
If third arg START is non-nil, start search at that index in STRING.
For index of first char beyond the match, do (match-end 0).
`match-end' and `match-beginning' also give indices of substrings
matched by parenthesis constructs in the pattern.</p>
<p>
You can use the function `match-string' to extract the substrings
matched by the parenthesis constructions in REGEXP.</p>
<p>

and is not in the header line or a tag table.<a name="vc-insert-file"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-insert-file</h3>
Insert the contents of FILE into the current buffer.</p>
<p>
Optional argument LIMIT is a regexp.  If present, the file is inserted
in chunks of size BLOCKSIZE (default 8 kByte), until the first
occurrence of LIMIT is found.  Anything from the start of that occurrence
to the end of the buffer is then deleted.  The function returns
non-nil if FILE exists and its contents were successfully inserted.<a name="isearch-printing-char"></a>

<h3>Function: woman</h3>
Browse UN*X man page for TOPIC (Without using external Man program).
The major browsing mode used is essentially the standard Man mode.
Choose the filename for the man page using completion, based on the
topic selected from the directories specified in `woman-manpath' and
`woman-path'.  The directory expansions and topics are cached for
speed, but a non-nil interactive argument forces the caches to be
updated (e.g. to re-interpret the current directory).</p>
<p>
Used non-interactively, arguments are optional: if given then TOPIC
should be a topic string and non-nil RE-CACHE forces re-caching.</p>

<h3>Function: next-file</h3>
Select next file among files in current tags table.</p>
<p>
A first argument of t (prefix arg, if interactive) initializes to the
beginning of the list of files in the tags table.  If the argument is
neither nil nor t, it is evalled to initialize the list of files.</p>
<p>
Non-nil second argument NOVISIT means use a temporary buffer
 to save time and avoid uninteresting warnings.</p>
<p>
Value is nil if the file was already visited;
if the file was newly read in, the value is the filename.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional INITIALIZE NOVISIT)<a name="string-make-multibyte"></a>
<h3>Function: string-make-multibyte</h3>
Return the multibyte equivalent of STRING.
If STRING is unibyte and contains non-ASCII characters, the function
`unibyte-char-to-multibyte' is used to convert each unibyte character
to a multibyte character.  In this case, the returned string is a
newly created string with no text properties.  If STRING is multibyte
or entirely ASCII, it is returned unchanged.  In particular, when
STRING is unibyte and entirely ASCII, the returned string is unibyte.
(When the characters are all ASCII, Emacs primitives will treat the
string the same way whether it is unibyte or multibyte.)</p>

(fn START END)<a name="timeclock-in"></a>
<h3>Function: timeclock-in</h3>
Clock in, recording the current time moment in the timelog.
With a numeric prefix ARG, record the fact that today has only that
many hours in it to be worked.  If ARG is a non-numeric prefix argument
(non-nil, but not a number), 0 is assumed (working on a holiday or
weekend).  *If not called interactively, ARG should be the number of
_seconds_ worked today*.  This feature only has effect the first time
this function is called within a day.</p>
<p>
PROJECT is the project being clocked into.  If PROJECT is nil, and
FIND-PROJECT is non-nil -- or the user calls `timeclock-in'
interactively -- call the function `timeclock-get-project-function' to
discover the name of the project.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG PROJECT FIND-PROJECT)<a name="dired-change-marks"></a>

(fn)<a name="version-list-="></a>
<h3>Function: version-list-=</h3>
Return t if L1, a list specification of a version, is equal to L2.</p>
<p>
Note that a version specified by the list (1) is equal to (1 0),
(1 0 0), (1 0 0 0), etc.  That is, the trailing zeros are insignificant.
Also, a version given by the list (1) is higher than (1 -1), which in
turn is higher than (1 -2), which is higher than (1 -3).<a name="other-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: other-buffer</h3>
Return most recently selected buffer other than BUFFER.
Buffers not visible in windows are preferred to visible buffers, unless
optional second argument VISIBLE-OK is non-nil.  Ignore the argument
BUFFER unless it denotes a live buffer.  If the optional third argument
FRAME is non-nil, use that frame's buffer list instead of the selected
frame's buffer list.</p>
<p>
The buffer is found by scanning the selected or specified frame's buffer
list first, followed by the list of all buffers.  If no other buffer
exists, return the buffer `*scratch*' (creating it if necessary).</p>
<p>
(fn &optional BUFFER VISIBLE-OK FRAME)<a name="dired-query"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-query</h3>
Format PROMPT with ARGS, query user, and store the result in SYM.
The return value is either nil or t.</p>
<p>
The user may type y or SPC to accept once; n or DEL to skip once;
! to accept this and subsequent queries; or q or ESC to decline
this and subsequent queries.</p>
<p>
If SYM is already bound to a non-nil value, this function may
return automatically without querying the user.  If SYM is !,
return t; if SYM is q or ESC, return nil.<a name="coding-system-from-name"></a>
<h3>Function: coding-system-from-name</h3>

(fn HANDLE)<a name="emacs-lock-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: emacs-lock-mode</h3>
Toggle Emacs Lock mode in the current buffer.
If called with a plain prefix argument, ask for the locking mode
to be used.  With any other prefix ARG, turn mode on if ARG is
positive, off otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode if
ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Initially, if the user does not pass an explicit locking mode, it
defaults to `emacs-lock-default-locking-mode' (which see);
afterwards, the locking mode most recently set on the buffer is
used instead.</p>
<p>
When called from Elisp code, ARG can be any locking mode:</p>
<p>
 exit   -- Emacs cannot exit while the buffer is locked
 kill   -- the buffer cannot be killed, but Emacs can exit as usual
 all    -- the buffer is locked against both actions</p>
<p>
Other values are interpreted as usual.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="awk-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: awk-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing AWK code.
To submit a problem report, enter `M-x c-submit-bug-report' from an
awk-mode buffer.  This automatically sets up a mail buffer with version
information already added.  You just need to add a description of the
problem, including a reproducible test case, and send the message.</p>
<p>
To see what version of CC Mode you are running, enter `M-x c-version'.</p>
<p>
The hook `c-mode-common-hook' is run with no args at mode
initialization, then `awk-mode-hook'.</p>

<p>
Note that a version specified by the list (1) is equal to (1 0),
(1 0 0), (1 0 0 0), etc.  That is, the trailing zeros are insignificant.
Also, a version given by the list (1) is higher than (1 -1), which in
turn is higher than (1 -2), which is higher than (1 -3).<a name="flycheck-elixir--check-for-dogma"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-elixir--check-for-dogma</h3>

(fn STRING TABLE PRED POINT)<a name="uudecode-decode-region"></a>
<h3>Function: uudecode-decode-region</h3>
Uudecode region between START and END.
If FILE-NAME is non-nil, save the result to FILE-NAME.</p>
<p>
(fn START END &optional FILE-NAME)<a name="skeleton-insert"></a>
<h3>Function: skeleton-insert</h3>
Insert the complex statement skeleton SKELETON describes very concisely.</p>
<p>
With optional second argument REGIONS, wrap first interesting point
(`_') in skeleton around next REGIONS words, if REGIONS is positive.
If REGIONS is negative, wrap REGIONS preceding interregions into first
REGIONS interesting positions (successive `_'s) in skeleton.</p>
<p>
An interregion is the stretch of text between two contiguous marked
points.  If you marked A B C [] (where [] is the cursor) in
alphabetical order, the 3 interregions are simply the last 3 regions.
But if you marked B A [] C, the interregions are B-A, A-[], []-C.</p>
<p>
The optional third argument STR, if specified, is the value for the
variable `str' within the skeleton.  When this is non-nil, the
interactor gets ignored, and this should be a valid skeleton element.</p>
<p>
SKELETON is made up as (INTERACTOR ELEMENT ...).  INTERACTOR may be nil if
not needed, a prompt-string or an expression for complex read functions.</p>
<p>
If ELEMENT is a string or a character it gets inserted (see also
`skeleton-transformation-function').  Other possibilities are:</p>
<p>
	\n	go to next line and indent according to mode
	_	interesting point, interregion here
	-	interesting point, no interregion interaction, overrides
		interesting point set by _
	>	indent line (or interregion if > _) according to major mode
	@	add position to `skeleton-positions'
	&	do next ELEMENT if previous moved point
	|	do next ELEMENT if previous didn't move point
	-num	delete num preceding characters (see `skeleton-untabify')
	resume:	skipped, continue here if quit is signaled
	nil	skipped</p>
<p>
After termination, point will be positioned at the last occurrence of -
or at the first occurrence of _ or at the end of the inserted text.</p>
<p>
Further elements can be defined via `skeleton-further-elements'.  ELEMENT may
itself be a SKELETON with an INTERACTOR.  The user is prompted repeatedly for
different inputs.  The SKELETON is processed as often as the user enters a
non-empty string.  C-g terminates skeleton insertion, but
continues after `resume:' and positions at `_' if any.  If INTERACTOR in such
a subskeleton is a prompt-string which contains a ".. %s .." it is
formatted with `skeleton-subprompt'.  Such an INTERACTOR may also be a list of
strings with the subskeleton being repeated once for each string.</p>
<p>
Quoted Lisp expressions are evaluated for their side-effects.
Other Lisp expressions are evaluated and the value treated as above.
Note that expressions may not return t since this implies an
endless loop.  Modes can define other symbols by locally setting them
to any valid skeleton element.  The following local variables are
available:</p>
<p>
	str	first time: read a string according to INTERACTOR
		then: insert previously read string once more
	help	help-form during interaction with the user or nil
	input	initial input (string or cons with index) while reading str
	v1, v2	local variables for memorizing anything you want</p>
<p>
When done with skeleton, but before going back to `_'-point call
`skeleton-end-hook' if that is non-nil.</p>

<h3>Function: mh-folder-mode</h3>
Major MH-E mode for "editing" an MH folder scan listing.
Uses keymap `mh-folder-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

You can show the message the cursor is pointing to, and step through
the messages. Messages can be marked for deletion or refiling into
another folder; these commands are executed all at once with a
separate command.</p>
<p>
Options that control this mode can be changed with
M-x customize-group; specify the "mh" group. In particular, please
see the `mh-scan-format-file' option if you wish to modify scan's
format.</p>
<p>
When a folder is visited, the hook `mh-folder-mode-hook' is run.</p>
<p>
Ranges
======
Many commands that operate on individual messages, such as
`mh-forward' or `mh-refile-msg' take a RANGE argument. This argument
can be used in several ways.</p>
<p>
If you provide the prefix argument (C-u) to
these commands, then you will be prompted for the message range.
This can be any valid MH range which can include messages,
sequences, and the abbreviations (described in the mh(1) man
page):</p>
<p>
<num1>-<num2>
    Indicates all messages in the range <num1> to <num2>, inclusive.
    The range must be nonempty.</p>
<p>
<num>:N
<num>:+N
<num>:-N
    Up to N messages beginning with (or ending with) message num. Num
    may be any of the predefined symbols: first, prev, cur, next or
    last.</p>
<p>
first:N
prev:N
next:N
last:N
    The first, previous, next or last messages, if they exist.</p>
<p>
all
    All of the messages.</p>
<p>
For example, a range that shows all of these things is `1 2 3
5-10 last:5 unseen'.</p>
<p>
If the option `transient-mark-mode' is set to t and you set a
region in the MH-Folder buffer, then the MH-E command will
perform the operation on all messages in that region.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `mh-folder-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>

(fn)<a name="set-window-text-height"></a>
<h3>Function: set-window-text-height</h3>
Set the height in lines of the text display area of WINDOW to HEIGHT.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.
HEIGHT doesn't include the mode line or header line, if any, or
any partial-height lines in the text display area.</p>
<p>
Note that the current implementation of this function cannot
always set the height exactly, but attempts to be conservative,
by allocating more lines than are actually needed in the case

<h3>Function: process-file-shell-command</h3>
Process files synchronously in a separate process.
Similar to `call-process-shell-command', but calls `process-file'.<a name="where-is-internal"></a>
<h3>Function: where-is-internal</h3>
Return list of keys that invoke DEFINITION.
If KEYMAP is a keymap, search only KEYMAP and the global keymap.
If KEYMAP is nil, search all the currently active keymaps, except
 for `overriding-local-map' (which is ignored).
If KEYMAP is a list of keymaps, search only those keymaps.</p>
<p>
If optional 3rd arg FIRSTONLY is non-nil, return the first key sequence found,
rather than a list of all possible key sequences.
If FIRSTONLY is the symbol `non-ascii', return the first binding found,
no matter what it is.
If FIRSTONLY has another non-nil value, prefer bindings
that use the modifier key specified in `where-is-preferred-modifier'
(or their meta variants) and entirely reject menu bindings.</p>
<p>
If optional 4th arg NOINDIRECT is non-nil, don't follow indirections
to other keymaps or slots.  This makes it possible to search for an
indirect definition itself.</p>
<p>
The optional 5th arg NO-REMAP alters how command remapping is handled:</p>
<p>
- If another command OTHER-COMMAND is remapped to DEFINITION, normally
  search for the bindings of OTHER-COMMAND and include them in the
  returned list.  But if NO-REMAP is non-nil, include the vector
  [remap OTHER-COMMAND] in the returned list instead, without
  searching for those other bindings.</p>
<p>
- If DEFINITION is remapped to OTHER-COMMAND, normally return the
  bindings for OTHER-COMMAND.  But if NO-REMAP is non-nil, return the
  bindings for DEFINITION instead, ignoring its remapping.</p>
<p>
(fn DEFINITION &optional KEYMAP FIRSTONLY NOINDIRECT NO-REMAP)<a name="byte-compile-file-form-require"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-compile-file-form-require</h3></p>
<p>

(fn FORM)<a name="dired-do-shell-command"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-do-shell-command</h3>
Run a shell command COMMAND on the marked files.
If no files are marked or a numeric prefix arg is given,
the next ARG files are used.  Just C-u means the current file.
The prompt mentions the file(s) or the marker, as appropriate.</p>
<p>
If there is a `*' in COMMAND, surrounded by whitespace, this runs
COMMAND just once with the entire file list substituted there.</p>
<p>
If there is no `*', but there is a `?' in COMMAND, surrounded by
whitespace, this runs COMMAND on each file individually with the
file name substituted for `?'.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, this runs COMMAND on each file individually with the
file name added at the end of COMMAND (separated by a space).</p>
<p>
`*' and `?' when not surrounded by whitespace have no special
significance for `dired-do-shell-command', and are passed through
normally to the shell, but you must confirm first.</p>
<p>
If you want to use `*' as a shell wildcard with whitespace around
it, write `*""' in place of just `*'.  This is equivalent to just
`*' in the shell, but avoids Dired's special handling.</p>
<p>
If COMMAND ends in `&', `;', or `;&', it is executed in the
background asynchronously, and the output appears in the buffer
`*Async Shell Command*'.  When operating on multiple files and COMMAND
ends in `&', the shell command is executed on each file in parallel.
However, when COMMAND ends in `;' or `;&' then commands are executed
in the background on each file sequentially waiting for each command
to terminate before running the next command.  You can also use
`dired-do-async-shell-command' that automatically adds `&'.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, COMMAND is executed synchronously, and the output
appears in the buffer `*Shell Command Output*'.</p>
<p>
This feature does not try to redisplay Dired buffers afterward, as
there's no telling what files COMMAND may have changed.
Type M-x dired-do-redisplay to redisplay the marked files.</p>
<p>
When COMMAND runs, its working directory is the top-level directory
of the Dired buffer, so output files usually are created there
instead of in a subdir.</p>
<p>
In a noninteractive call (from Lisp code), you must specify
the list of file names explicitly with the FILE-LIST argument, which
can be produced by `dired-get-marked-files', for example.<a name="locale-charset-match-p"></a>
<h3>Function: locale-charset-match-p</h3>
Whether charset names (strings) CHARSET1 and CHARSET2 are equivalent.
Matching is done ignoring case and any hyphens and underscores in the
names.  E.g. `ISO_8859-1' and `iso88591' both match `iso-8859-1'.<a name="windmove-up"></a>
<h3>Function: windmove-up</h3>
Select the window above the current one.
With no prefix argument, or with prefix argument equal to zero, "up"
is relative to the position of point in the window; otherwise it is
relative to the left edge (for positive ARG) or the right edge (for
negative ARG) of the current window.
If no window is at the desired location, an error is signaled.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: ebnf-eps-directory</h3>
Generate EPS files from EBNF files in DIRECTORY.</p>
<p>
If DIRECTORY is nil, it's used `default-directory'.</p>
<p>
The files in DIRECTORY that matches `ebnf-file-suffix-regexp' (which see) are
processed.</p>
<p>
See also `ebnf-eps-buffer'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional DIRECTORY)<a name="intern"></a>
<h3>Function: intern</h3>
Return the canonical symbol whose name is STRING.
If there is none, one is created by this function and returned.
A second optional argument specifies the obarray to use;
it defaults to the value of `obarray'.</p>
<p>
(fn STRING &optional OBARRAY)<a name="widget-add-documentation-string-button"></a>
<h3>Function: widget-add-documentation-string-button</h3>
Insert a new `documentation-string' widget based on WIDGET.
The new widget becomes a child of WIDGET, and is also added to
its `:buttons' list.  The documentation string is found from
WIDGET using the function `widget-docstring'.
Optional ARGS specifies additional keyword arguments for the
`documentation-string' widget.</p>
<p>
(fn WIDGET &rest ARGS)<a name="flycheck-error-list-previous-error"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-error-list-previous-error</h3>
Go to the N'th previous error in the error list.<a name="ert--results-test-at-point-allow-redefinition"></a>
<h3>Function: ert--results-test-at-point-allow-redefinition</h3>
Look up the test at point, and check whether it has been redefined.</p>
<p>
To be used in the ERT results buffer.</p>
<p>
Returns a list of two elements: the test (or nil) and a symbol
specifying whether the test has been redefined.</p>
<p>
If a new test has been defined with the same name as the test at
point, replaces the test at point with the new test, and returns
the new test and the symbol `redefined'.</p>
<p>
If the test has been deleted, returns the old test and the symbol
`deleted'.</p>
<p>
If the test is still current, returns the test and the symbol nil.</p>
<p>
If there is no test at point, returns a list with two nils.<a name="comint-preinput-scroll-to-bottom"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-preinput-scroll-to-bottom</h3>
Go to the end of buffer in all windows showing it.
Movement occurs if point in the selected window is not after the process mark,
and `this-command' is an insertion command.  Insertion commands recognized
are `self-insert-command', `comint-magic-space', `yank', and `hilit-yank'.
Depends on the value of `comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-input'.</p>
<p>
This function should be a pre-command hook.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="package-strip-version"></a>
<h3>Function: package-strip-version</h3>
Strip the version from a combined package name and version.
E.g., if given "quux-23.0", will return "quux"<a name="rfc822-goto-eoh"></a>
<h3>Function: rfc822-goto-eoh</h3>
If the buffer starts with a mail header, move point to the header's end.
Otherwise, moves to `point-min'.
The end of the header is the start of the next line, if there is one,
else the end of the last line.  This function obeys RFC822.<a name="undo-elt-crosses-region"></a>
<h3>Function: undo-elt-crosses-region</h3>
Test whether UNDO-ELT crosses one edge of that region START ... END.
This assumes we have already decided that UNDO-ELT
is not *inside* the region START...END.<a name="org-capture"></a>
<h3>Function: org-capture</h3>
Capture something.</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `org-capture-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
This will let you select a template from `org-capture-templates', and then
file the newly captured information.  The text is immediately inserted
at the target location, and an indirect buffer is shown where you can
edit it.  Pressing M-x org-capture-finalize brings you back to the previous state
of Emacs, so that you can continue your work.</p>
<p>
When called interactively with a C-u prefix argument GOTO, don't capture
anything, just go to the file/headline where the selected template
stores its notes.  With a double prefix argument C-u C-u, go to the last note
stored.</p>
<p>
When called with a `C-0' (zero) prefix, insert a template at point.</p>
<p>
Lisp programs can set KEYS to a string associated with a template
in `org-capture-templates'.  In this case, interactive selection
will be bypassed.</p>
<p>
If `org-capture-use-agenda-date' is non-nil, capturing from the
agenda will use the date at point as the default date.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional GOTO KEYS)<a name="gnus-treat-mail-gravatar"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-treat-mail-gravatar</h3>
Display gravatars in the Cc and To headers.
If gravatars are already displayed, remove them.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FORCE)<a name="frame-parameters"></a>
<h3>Function: frame-parameters</h3>
Return the parameters-alist of frame FRAME.
It is a list of elements of the form (PARM . VALUE), where PARM is a symbol.
The meaningful PARMs depend on the kind of frame.
If FRAME is omitted, return information on the currently selected frame.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FRAME)<a name="slot-exists-p"></a>
<h3>Function: slot-exists-p</h3>
Return non-nil if OBJECT-OR-CLASS has SLOT.<a name="dired-glob-regexp"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-glob-regexp</h3>
Convert glob-pattern PATTERN to a regular expression.</p>
<p>
(fn PATTERN)<a name="debugger-reenable"></a>
<h3>Function: debugger-reenable</h3>
Turn all debug-on-entry functions back on.
This function is put on `post-command-hook' by `debugger-jump' and
removes itself from that hook.<a name="rot13-other-window"></a>
<h3>Function: rot13-other-window</h3>
Display current buffer in ROT13 in another window.
The text itself is not modified, only the way it is displayed is affected.</p>
<p>
To terminate the ROT13 display, delete that window.  As long as that window
is not deleted, any buffer displayed in it will become instantly encoded
in ROT13.</p>
<p>
See also `toggle-rot13-mode'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="cyrillic-encode-alternativnyj-char"></a>
<h3>Function: cyrillic-encode-alternativnyj-char</h3>
Return ALTERNATIVNYJ external character code of CHAR if appropriate.</p>
<p>
(fn CHAR)<a name="revert-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: revert-buffer</h3>
Replace current buffer text with the text of the visited file on disk.
This undoes all changes since the file was visited or saved.
With a prefix argument, offer to revert from latest auto-save file, if
that is more recent than the visited file.</p>
<p>
This command also implements an interface for special buffers
that contain text which doesn't come from a file, but reflects
some other data instead (e.g. Dired buffers, `buffer-list'
buffers).  This is done via the variable `revert-buffer-function'.
In these cases, it should reconstruct the buffer contents from the
appropriate data.</p>
<p>
When called from Lisp, the first argument is IGNORE-AUTO; only offer
to revert from the auto-save file when this is nil.  Note that the
sense of this argument is the reverse of the prefix argument, for the
sake of backward compatibility.  IGNORE-AUTO is optional, defaulting
to nil.</p>
<p>
Optional second argument NOCONFIRM means don't ask for confirmation
at all.  (The variable `revert-without-query' offers another way to
revert buffers without querying for confirmation.)</p>
<p>
Optional third argument PRESERVE-MODES non-nil means don't alter
the files modes.  Normally we reinitialize them using `normal-mode'.</p>
<p>
This function binds `revert-buffer-in-progress-p' non-nil while it operates.</p>
<p>
If the value of `revert-buffer-function' is non-nil, it is called to
do all the work for this command.  Otherwise, the hooks
`before-revert-hook' and `after-revert-hook' are run at the beginning
and the end, and if `revert-buffer-insert-file-contents-function' is
non-nil, it is called instead of rereading visited file contents.<a name="mkdir"></a>
<h3>Function: mkdir</h3>
Create the directory DIR and optionally any nonexistent parent dirs.
If DIR already exists as a directory, signal an error, unless
PARENTS is non-nil.</p>
<p>
Interactively, the default choice of directory to create is the
current buffer's default directory.  That is useful when you have
visited a file in a nonexistent directory.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, the second (optional) argument PARENTS, if
non-nil, says whether to create parent directories that don't
exist.  Interactively, this happens by default.</p>
<p>
If creating the directory or directories fail, an error will be
raised.<a name="frame-root-window"></a>
<h3>Function: frame-root-window</h3>
Return the root window of FRAME-OR-WINDOW.
If omitted, FRAME-OR-WINDOW defaults to the currently selected frame.
With a frame argument, return that frame's root window.
With a window argument, return the root window of that window's frame.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FRAME-OR-WINDOW)<a name="member*"></a>
<h3>Function: member*</h3>
Find the first occurrence of ITEM in LIST.
Return the sublist of LIST whose car is ITEM.</p>
<p>
Keywords supported:  :test :test-not :key</p>
<p>
(fn ITEM LIST [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="goto-next-locus"></a>
<h3>Function: goto-next-locus</h3>
Visit next `next-error' message and corresponding source code.</p>
<p>
If all the error messages parsed so far have been processed already,
the message buffer is checked for new ones.</p>
<p>
A prefix ARG specifies how many error messages to move;
negative means move back to previous error messages.
Just C-u as a prefix means reparse the error message buffer
and start at the first error.</p>
<p>
The RESET argument specifies that we should restart from the beginning.</p>
<p>
C-x ` normally uses the most recently started
compilation, grep, or occur buffer.  It can also operate on any
buffer with output from the M-x compile, M-x grep commands, or,
more generally, on any buffer in Compilation mode or with
Compilation Minor mode enabled, or any buffer in which
`next-error-function' is bound to an appropriate function.
To specify use of a particular buffer for error messages, type
C-x ` in that buffer when it is the only one displayed
in the current frame.</p>
<p>
Once C-x ` has chosen the buffer for error messages, it
runs `next-error-hook' with `run-hooks', and stays with that buffer
until you use it in some other buffer which uses Compilation mode
or Compilation Minor mode.</p>
<p>
To control which errors are matched, customize the variable
`compilation-error-regexp-alist'.<a name="subword-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: subword-mode</h3>
Toggle subword movement and editing (Subword mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Subword mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Subword mode is a buffer-local minor mode.  Enabling it remaps
word-based editing commands to subword-based commands that handle
symbols with mixed uppercase and lowercase letters,
e.g. "GtkWidget", "EmacsFrameClass", "NSGraphicsContext".</p>
<p>
Here we call these mixed case symbols `nomenclatures'.  Each
capitalized (or completely uppercase) part of a nomenclature is
called a `subword'.  Here are some examples:</p>
<p>
  Nomenclature           Subwords
  ===========================================================
  GtkWindow          =>  "Gtk" and "Window"
  EmacsFrameClass    =>  "Emacs", "Frame" and "Class"
  NSGraphicsContext  =>  "NS", "Graphics" and "Context"</p>
<p>
The subword oriented commands activated in this minor mode recognize
subwords in a nomenclature to move between subwords and to edit them
as words.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `subword-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

(fn &optional ARG)<a name="mouse-autoselect-window-start"></a>
<h3>Function: mouse-autoselect-window-start</h3>
Start delayed window autoselection.
MOUSE-POSITION is the last position where the mouse was seen as returned
by `mouse-position'.  Optional argument WINDOW non-nil denotes the
window where the mouse was seen.  Optional argument SUSPEND non-nil
means suspend autoselection.<a name="format-decode-region"></a>

Return non-nil if DISPLAY's screen supports the SaveUnder feature.<a name="global-auto-composition-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: global-auto-composition-mode</h3>
Toggle Auto Composition mode in all buffers.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable it if ARG is positive, and
disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable it if ARG is
omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
For more information on Auto Composition mode, see
`auto-composition-mode' .<a name="vc-cvs-registered"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-cvs-registered</h3>
Return non-nil if file F is registered with CVS.<a name="tool-bar-add-item"></a>
<h3>Function: tool-bar-add-item</h3>
Add an item to the tool bar.
ICON names the image, DEF is the key definition and KEY is a symbol
for the fake function key in the menu keymap.  Remaining arguments
PROPS are additional items to add to the menu item specification.  See
Info node `(elisp)Tool Bar'.  Items are added from left to right.</p>
<p>
ICON is the base name of a file containing the image to use.  The
function will first try to use low-color/ICON.xpm if `display-color-cells'
is less or equal to 256, then ICON.xpm, then ICON.pbm, and finally
ICON.xbm, using `find-image'.</p>
<p>
Use this function only to make bindings in the global value of `tool-bar-map'.
To define items in any other map, use `tool-bar-local-item'.<a name="x-handle-named-frame-geometry"></a>

<h3>Function: pcomplete-entries</h3>
Complete against a list of directory candidates.
If REGEXP is non-nil, it is a regular expression used to refine the
match (files not matching the REGEXP will be excluded).
If PREDICATE is non-nil, it will also be used to refine the match
(files for which the PREDICATE returns nil will be excluded).
If no directory information can be extracted from the completed
component, `default-directory' is used as the basis for completion.</p>

<h3>Function: flycheck-dequalify-error-ids</h3>
De-qualify error ids in ERRORS.</p>
<p>
Remove all qualifications from error ids in ERRORS, by stripping
all leading dotted components from error IDs.  For instance, if
the error ID is com.foo.E100, replace it with E100.</p>

<p>
(fn INTEGER)<a name="facemenu-read-color"></a>
<h3>Function: facemenu-read-color</h3>
Read a color name or RGB triplet.
Completion is available for color names, but not for RGB triplets.</p>
<p>
RGB triplets have the form "#RRGGBB".  Each of the R, G, and B
components can have one to four digits, but all three components
must have the same number of digits.  Each digit is a hex value
between 0 and F; either upper case or lower case for A through F
are acceptable.</p>
<p>
In addition to standard color names and RGB hex values, the
following are available as color candidates.  In each case, the
corresponding color is used.</p>
<p>
 * `foreground at point'   - foreground under the cursor
 * `background at point'   - background under the cursor</p>
<p>
Optional arg PROMPT is the prompt; if nil, use a default prompt.</p>
<p>
Interactively, or with optional arg CONVERT-TO-RGB-P non-nil,
convert an input color name to an RGB hex string.  Return the RGB
hex string.</p>
<p>
If optional arg ALLOW-EMPTY-NAME is non-nil, the user is allowed
to enter an empty color name (the empty string).</p>

<p>
(fn)<a name="print"></a>
<h3>Function: print</h3>
Output the printed representation of OBJECT, with newlines around it.
Quoting characters are printed when needed to make output that `read'
can handle, whenever this is possible.  For complex objects, the behavior
is controlled by `print-level' and `print-length', which see.</p>
<p>
OBJECT is any of the Lisp data types: a number, a string, a symbol,
a list, a buffer, a window, a frame, etc.</p>
<p>
A printed representation of an object is text which describes that object.</p>
<p>
Optional argument PRINTCHARFUN is the output stream, which can be one
of these:</p>
<p>
   - a buffer, in which case output is inserted into that buffer at point;
   - a marker, in which case output is inserted at marker's position;
   - a function, in which case that function is called once for each
     character of OBJECT's printed representation;
   - a symbol, in which case that symbol's function definition is called; or
   - t, in which case the output is displayed in the echo area.</p>
<p>
If PRINTCHARFUN is omitted, the value of `standard-output' (which see)
is used instead.</p>
<p>

PROP is `theme-face' for a face, `theme-value' for a variable.</p>
<p>
MODE can be either the symbol `set' or the symbol `reset'.  If it is the
symbol `set', then VALUE is the value to use.  If it is the symbol
`reset', then SYMBOL will be removed from THEME (VALUE is ignored).</p>
<p>

<p>
(fn FONT PROP VAL)<a name="file-name-as-directory"></a>
<h3>Function: file-name-as-directory</h3>
Return a string representing the file name FILE interpreted as a directory.
This operation exists because a directory is also a file, but its name as
a directory is different from its name as a file.
The result can be used as the value of `default-directory'
or passed as second argument to `expand-file-name'.
For a Unix-syntax file name, just appends a slash.</p>

(fn &optional FRAME)<a name="make-temp-name"></a>
<h3>Function: make-temp-name</h3>
Generate temporary file name (string) starting with PREFIX (a string).
The Emacs process number forms part of the result,
so there is no danger of generating a name being used by another process.</p>
<p>
In addition, this function makes an attempt to choose a name
which has no existing file.  To make this work,
PREFIX should be an absolute file name.</p>
<p>
There is a race condition between calling `make-temp-name' and creating the
file which opens all kinds of security holes.  For that reason, you should
probably use `make-temp-file' instead, except in three circumstances:</p>
<p>
* If you are creating the file in the user's home directory.
* If you are creating a directory rather than an ordinary file.
* If you are taking special precautions as `make-temp-file' does.</p>

If called with a prefix asks for the FILE to compile, otherwise uses
the value of `fortune-file'.  This currently cannot handle directories.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FILE)<a name="find-change-log"></a>
<h3>Function: find-change-log</h3>
Find a change log file for M-x add-change-log-entry and return the name.</p>
<p>
Optional arg FILE-NAME specifies the file to use.
If FILE-NAME is nil, use the value of `change-log-default-name'.
If `change-log-default-name' is nil, behave as though it were 'ChangeLog'
(or whatever we use on this operating system).</p>
<p>
If `change-log-default-name' contains a leading directory component, then
simply find it in the current directory.  Otherwise, search in the current
directory and its successive parents for a file so named.</p>
<p>
Once a file is found, `change-log-default-name' is set locally in the
current buffer to the complete file name.
Optional arg BUFFER-FILE overrides `buffer-file-name'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FILE-NAME BUFFER-FILE)<a name="set-window-fringes"></a>
<h3>Function: set-window-fringes</h3>
Set the fringe widths of window WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
Second arg LEFT-WIDTH specifies the number of pixels to reserve for
the left fringe.  Optional third arg RIGHT-WIDTH specifies the right
fringe width.  If a fringe width arg is nil, that means to use the
frame's default fringe width.  Default fringe widths can be set with
the command `set-fringe-style'.
If optional fourth arg OUTSIDE-MARGINS is non-nil, draw the fringes
outside of the display margins.  By default, fringes are drawn between
display marginal areas and the text area.</p>
<p>
(fn WINDOW LEFT-WIDTH &optional RIGHT-WIDTH OUTSIDE-MARGINS)<a name="ert--print-backtrace"></a>
<h3>Function: ert--print-backtrace</h3>
Format the backtrace BACKTRACE to the current buffer.<a name="ewoc--insert-new-node"></a>
<h3>Function: ewoc--insert-new-node</h3>
Insert before NODE a new node for DATA, displayed by PRETTY-PRINTER.
Fourth arg DLL -- from `(ewoc--dll EWOC)' -- is for internal purposes.
Call PRETTY-PRINTER with point at NODE's start, thus pushing back
NODE and leaving the new node's start there.  Return the new node.</p>
<p>
(fn NODE DATA PRETTY-PRINTER DLL)<a name="auth-source-read-char-choice"></a>
<h3>Function: auth-source-read-char-choice</h3>
Read one of CHOICES by `read-char-choice', or `read-char'.
`dropdown-list' support is disabled because it doesn't work reliably.
Only one of CHOICES will be returned.  The PROMPT is augmented
with "[a/b/c] " if CHOICES is '(?a ?b ?c).<a name="dired-unmark-all-marks"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-unmark-all-marks</h3>
Remove all marks from all files in the dired buffer.</p>

(fn)<a name="isearch-fallback"></a>
<h3>Function: isearch-fallback</h3>
Return point to previous successful match to allow regexp liberalization.</p>
<p>
Respects C-s and C-r by stopping at `isearch-barrier' as needed.</p>
<p>
Do nothing if a backslash is escaping the liberalizing character.
If WANT-BACKSLASH is non-nil, invert this behavior (for \} and \|).</p>
<p>
Do nothing if regexp has recently been invalid unless optional
ALLOW-INVALID non-nil.</p>
<p>
If optional TO-BARRIER non-nil, ignore previous matches and go exactly
to the barrier.<a name="smtpmail-send-it"></a>

(fn)<a name="next-button"></a>
<h3>Function: next-button</h3>
Return the next button after position POS in the current buffer.
If COUNT-CURRENT is non-nil, count any button at POS in the search,
instead of starting at the next button.<a name="check-coding-systems-region"></a>
<h3>Function: check-coding-systems-region</h3>
Check if the region is encodable by coding systems.</p>
<p>
START and END are buffer positions specifying the region.
CODING-SYSTEM-LIST is a list of coding systems to check.</p>
<p>
The value is an alist ((CODING-SYSTEM POS0 POS1 ...) ...), where
CODING-SYSTEM is a member of CODING-SYSTEM-LIST and can't encode the
whole region, POS0, POS1, ... are buffer positions where non-encodable
characters are found.</p>
<p>
If all coding systems in CODING-SYSTEM-LIST can encode the region, the
value is nil.</p>
<p>
START may be a string.  In that case, check if the string is
encodable, and the value contains indices to the string instead of
buffer positions.  END is ignored.</p>
<p>
If the current buffer (or START if it is a string) is unibyte, the value
is nil.</p>
<p>
(fn START END CODING-SYSTEM-LIST)<a name="url-http-activate-callback"></a>
<h3>Function: url-http-activate-callback</h3>
Activate callback specified when this buffer was created.<a name="vc-git-diff"></a>

(fn FILES &optional REV1 REV2 BUFFER)<a name="with-timeout-suspend"></a>
<h3>Function: with-timeout-suspend</h3>
Stop the clock for `with-timeout'.  Used by debuggers.
The idea is that the time you spend in the debugger should not
count against these timeouts.</p>
<p>
The value is a list that the debugger can pass to `with-timeout-unsuspend'
when it exits, to make these timers start counting again.<a name="cvs-status-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: cvs-status-mode</h3>
Mode used for cvs status output.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="save-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: save-buffer</h3>
Save current buffer in visited file if modified.
Variations are described below.</p>
<p>
By default, makes the previous version into a backup file
 if previously requested or if this is the first save.
Prefixed with one C-u, marks this version
 to become a backup when the next save is done.
Prefixed with two C-u's,
 unconditionally makes the previous version into a backup file.
Prefixed with three C-u's, marks this version
 to become a backup when the next save is done,
 and unconditionally makes the previous version into a backup file.</p>
<p>
With a numeric argument of 0, never make the previous version
into a backup file.</p>
<p>
If a file's name is FOO, the names of its numbered backup versions are
 FOO.~i~ for various integers i.  A non-numbered backup file is called FOO~.
Numeric backups (rather than FOO~) will be made if value of
 `version-control' is not the atom `never' and either there are already
 numeric versions of the file being backed up, or `version-control' is
 non-nil.
We don't want excessive versions piling up, so there are variables
 `kept-old-versions', which tells Emacs how many oldest versions to keep,
 and `kept-new-versions', which tells how many newest versions to keep.
 Defaults are 2 old versions and 2 new.
`dired-kept-versions' controls dired's clean-directory (.) command.
If `delete-old-versions' is nil, system will query user
 before trimming versions.  Otherwise it does it silently.</p>
<p>
If `vc-make-backup-files' is nil, which is the default,
 no backup files are made for files managed by version control.
 (This is because the version control system itself records previous versions.)</p>
<p>
See the subroutine `basic-save-buffer' for more information.<a name="previous-matching-history-element"></a>
<h3>Function: previous-matching-history-element</h3>
Find the previous history element that matches REGEXP.
(Previous history elements refer to earlier actions.)
With prefix argument N, search for Nth previous match.
If N is negative, find the next or Nth next match.
Normally, history elements are matched case-insensitively if
`case-fold-search' is non-nil, but an uppercase letter in REGEXP
makes the search case-sensitive.
See also `minibuffer-history-case-insensitive-variables'.<a name="princ"></a>
<h3>Function: princ</h3>
Output the printed representation of OBJECT, any Lisp object.
No quoting characters are used; no delimiters are printed around
the contents of strings.</p>
<p>
OBJECT is any of the Lisp data types: a number, a string, a symbol,
a list, a buffer, a window, a frame, etc.</p>
<p>
A printed representation of an object is text which describes that object.</p>
<p>
Optional argument PRINTCHARFUN is the output stream, which can be one
of these:</p>
<p>
   - a buffer, in which case output is inserted into that buffer at point;
   - a marker, in which case output is inserted at marker's position;
   - a function, in which case that function is called once for each
     character of OBJECT's printed representation;
   - a symbol, in which case that symbol's function definition is called; or
   - t, in which case the output is displayed in the echo area.</p>
<p>
If PRINTCHARFUN is omitted, the value of `standard-output' (which see)
is used instead.</p>

can take care of filling.  JUSTIFY is used as in `fill-paragraph'.<a name="japanese-zenkaku"></a>
<h3>Function: japanese-zenkaku</h3>
Convert argument to `zenkaku' and return that.
The argument may be a character or string.  The result has the same type.
The argument object is not altered--the value is a copy.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJ)<a name="seq-copy"></a>
<h3>Function: seq-copy</h3>
Return a copy of a list, vector, string or char-table.

WORKING-REVISION and LIMIT.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WORKING-REVISION LIMIT)<a name="display-time-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: display-time-mode</h3>
Toggle display of time, load level, and mail flag in mode lines.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Display Time mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
it if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When Display Time mode is enabled, it updates every minute (you
can control the number of seconds between updates by customizing
`display-time-interval').  If `display-time-day-and-date' is
non-nil, the current day and date are displayed as well.  This
runs the normal hook `display-time-hook' after each update.<a name="cperl-perldoc-at-point"></a>
<h3>Function: cperl-perldoc-at-point</h3>
Run a `perldoc' on the word around point.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="bs-show"></a>
<h3>Function: bs-show</h3>
Make a menu of buffers so you can manipulate buffers or the buffer list.</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `bs-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
There are many key commands similar to `Buffer-menu-mode' for
manipulating the buffer list and the buffers themselves.
User can move with [up] or [down], select a buffer
by M-x bs-select or [SPC]</p>
<p>
Type M-x bs-kill to leave Buffer Selection Menu without a selection.
Type M-x bs-help after invocation to get help on commands available.

name of buffer configuration.</p>
<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="macroexpand"></a>
<h3>Function: macroexpand</h3>
Return result of expanding macros at top level of FORM.
If FORM is not a macro call, it is returned unchanged.
Otherwise, the macro is expanded and the expansion is considered
in place of FORM.  When a non-macro-call results, it is returned.</p>
<p>
The second optional arg ENVIRONMENT specifies an environment of macro
definitions to shadow the loaded ones for use in file byte-compilation.</p>
<p>
(fn FORM &optional ENVIRONMENT)<a name="Info-final-node"></a>

<p>
(fn WINDOW PARAMETER)<a name="string-to-multibyte"></a>
<h3>Function: string-to-multibyte</h3>
Return a multibyte string with the same individual chars as STRING.
If STRING is multibyte, the result is STRING itself.
Otherwise it is a newly created string, with no text properties.</p>
<p>
If STRING is unibyte and contains an 8-bit byte, it is converted to
the corresponding multibyte character of charset `eight-bit'.</p>
<p>
This differs from `string-as-multibyte' by converting each byte of a correct
utf-8 sequence to an eight-bit character, not just bytes that don't form a
correct sequence.</p>

The detection takes into account the coding system priorities for the
language environment LANG-ENV.<a name="decode-time"></a>
<h3>Function: decode-time</h3>
Decode a time value as (SEC MINUTE HOUR DAY MONTH YEAR DOW DST ZONE).
The optional SPECIFIED-TIME should be a list of (HIGH LOW . IGNORED),
as from `current-time' and `file-attributes', or nil to use the
current time.  The obsolete form (HIGH . LOW) is also still accepted.
The list has the following nine members: SEC is an integer between 0
and 60; SEC is 60 for a leap second, which only some operating systems
support.  MINUTE is an integer between 0 and 59.  HOUR is an integer
between 0 and 23.  DAY is an integer between 1 and 31.  MONTH is an
integer between 1 and 12.  YEAR is an integer indicating the
four-digit year.  DOW is the day of week, an integer between 0 and 6,
where 0 is Sunday.  DST is t if daylight saving time is in effect,
otherwise nil.  ZONE is an integer indicating the number of seconds
east of Greenwich.  (Note that Common Lisp has different meanings for
DOW and ZONE.)</p>

<h3>Function: winner-edges</h3>
Return a list of the edge coordinates of WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
The returned list has the form (LEFT TOP RIGHT BOTTOM).  TOP and BOTTOM
count by lines, and LEFT and RIGHT count by columns, all relative to 0,
0 at top left corner of frame.</p>
<p>
RIGHT is one more than the rightmost column occupied by WINDOW.  BOTTOM
is one more than the bottommost row occupied by WINDOW.  The edges
include the space used by WINDOW's scroll bar, display margins, fringes,
header line, and/or mode line.  For the edges of just the text area, use
`window-inside-edges'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WINDOW)<a name="coerce"></a>
<h3>Function: coerce</h3>
Coerce OBJECT to type TYPE.
TYPE is a Common Lisp type specifier.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT TYPE)<a name="insert-abbrev-table-description"></a>
<h3>Function: insert-abbrev-table-description</h3>
Insert before point a full description of abbrev table named NAME.
NAME is a symbol whose value is an abbrev table.
If optional 2nd arg READABLE is non-nil, a human-readable description
is inserted.  Otherwise the description is an expression,
a call to `define-abbrev-table', which would
define the abbrev table NAME exactly as it is currently defined.</p>
<p>
Abbrevs marked as "system abbrevs" are omitted.</p>
<p>
(fn NAME &optional READABLE)<a name="which-function-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: which-function-mode</h3>
Toggle mode line display of current function (Which Function mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Which Function mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Which Function mode is a global minor mode.  When enabled, the
current function name is continuously displayed in the mode line,
in certain major modes.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="pr-txt-fast-fire"></a>
<h3>Function: pr-txt-fast-fire</h3>
Fast fire function for text printing.</p>
<p>
If a region is active, the region will be printed instead of the whole buffer.
Also if the current major-mode is defined in `pr-mode-alist', the settings in
`pr-mode-alist' will be used, that is, the current buffer or region will be
printed using `pr-txt-mode'.</p>
<p>
Interactively, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the
user for a new active text printer.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, the argument SELECT-PRINTER is treated as follows:</p>
<p>
   If it's nil, the printing is sent to the current active text printer.</p>
<p>
   If it's a symbol which it's defined in `pr-txt-printer-alist', it's the new
   active printer and printing will immediately be done using the new active
   printer.</p>
<p>
   If it's non-nil, the command prompts the user for a new active text printer.</p>
<p>
Note that this command always behaves as if `pr-auto-region' and `pr-auto-mode'
are both set to t.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional SELECT-PRINTER)<a name="x-defined-colors"></a>
<h3>Function: x-defined-colors</h3>
Return a list of colors supported for a particular frame.
The argument FRAME specifies which frame to try.
The value may be different for frames on different display types.
If FRAME doesn't support colors, the value is nil.
If FRAME is nil, that stands for the selected frame.<a name="shrink-window"></a>
<h3>Function: shrink-window</h3>
Make the selected window DELTA lines smaller.
Interactively, if no argument is given, make the selected window
one line smaller.  If optional argument HORIZONTAL is non-nil,
make selected window narrower by DELTA columns.  If DELTA is
negative, enlarge selected window by -DELTA lines or columns.
Also see the `window-min-height' variable.<a name="read-string"></a>
<h3>Function: read-string</h3>
Read a string from the minibuffer, prompting with string PROMPT.
If non-nil, second arg INITIAL-INPUT is a string to insert before reading.
  This argument has been superseded by DEFAULT-VALUE and should normally
  be nil in new code.  It behaves as in `read-from-minibuffer'.  See the
  documentation string of that function for details.
The third arg HISTORY, if non-nil, specifies a history list
  and optionally the initial position in the list.
See `read-from-minibuffer' for details of HISTORY argument.
Fourth arg DEFAULT-VALUE is the default value or the list of default values.
 If non-nil, it is used for history commands, and as the value (or the first
 element of the list of default values) to return if the user enters the
 empty string.
Fifth arg INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD, if non-nil, means the minibuffer inherits
 the current input method and the setting of `enable-multibyte-characters'.</p>
<p>
(fn PROMPT &optional INITIAL-INPUT HISTORY DEFAULT-VALUE INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD)<a name="widget-default-active"></a>

Perform `undo', ignoring the buffer's read-only status.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="end-of-visual-line"></a>
<h3>Function: end-of-visual-line</h3>
Move point to end of current visual line.
With argument N not nil or 1, move forward N - 1 visual lines first.
If point reaches the beginning or end of buffer, it stops there.
To ignore intangibility, bind `inhibit-point-motion-hooks' to t.<a name="cperl-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: cperl-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing Perl code.
Expression and list commands understand all C brackets.
Tab indents for Perl code.
Paragraphs are separated by blank lines only.
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.</p>
<p>
Various characters in Perl almost always come in pairs: {}, (), [],
sometimes <>.  When the user types the first, she gets the second as
well, with optional special formatting done on {}.  (Disabled by
default.)  You can always quote (with C-q) the left
"paren" to avoid the expansion.  The processing of < is special,
since most the time you mean "less".  CPerl mode tries to guess
whether you want to type pair <>, and inserts is if it
appropriate.  You can set `cperl-electric-parens-string' to the string that
contains the parens from the above list you want to be electrical.
Electricity of parens is controlled by `cperl-electric-parens'.
You may also set `cperl-electric-parens-mark' to have electric parens
look for active mark and "embrace" a region if possible.'</p>
<p>
CPerl mode provides expansion of the Perl control constructs:</p>
<p>
   if, else, elsif, unless, while, until, continue, do,
   for, foreach, formy and foreachmy.</p>
<p>
and POD directives (Disabled by default, see `cperl-electric-keywords'.)</p>
<p>
The user types the keyword immediately followed by a space, which
causes the construct to be expanded, and the point is positioned where
she is most likely to want to be.  E.g., when the user types a space
following "if" the following appears in the buffer: if () { or if ()
} { } and the cursor is between the parentheses.  The user can then
type some boolean expression within the parens.  Having done that,
typing M-x cperl-linefeed places you - appropriately indented - on a
new line between the braces (if you typed M-x cperl-linefeed in a POD
directive line, then appropriate number of new lines is inserted).</p>
<p>
If CPerl decides that you want to insert "English" style construct like</p>
<p>
            bite if angry;</p>
<p>
it will not do any expansion.  See also help on variable
`cperl-extra-newline-before-brace'.  (Note that one can switch the
help message on expansion by setting `cperl-message-electric-keyword'
to nil.)</p>
<p>
M-x cperl-linefeed is a convenience replacement for typing carriage
return.  It places you in the next line with proper indentation, or if
you type it inside the inline block of control construct, like</p>
<p>
            foreach (@lines) {print; print}</p>
<p>
and you are on a boundary of a statement inside braces, it will
transform the construct into a multiline and will place you into an
appropriately indented blank line.  If you need a usual
`newline-and-indent' behavior, it is on C-j,
see documentation on `cperl-electric-linefeed'.</p>
<p>
Use M-x cperl-invert-if-unless to change a construction of the form</p>
<p>
	    if (A) { B }</p>
<p>
into</p>
<p>
            B if A;</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `cperl-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

Setting the variable `cperl-font-lock' to t switches on font-lock-mode
(even with older Emacsen), `cperl-electric-lbrace-space' to t switches
on electric space between $ and {, `cperl-electric-parens-string' is
the string that contains parentheses that should be electric in CPerl
(see also `cperl-electric-parens-mark' and `cperl-electric-parens'),
setting `cperl-electric-keywords' enables electric expansion of
control structures in CPerl.  `cperl-electric-linefeed' governs which
one of two linefeed behavior is preferable.  You can enable all these
options simultaneously (recommended mode of use) by setting
`cperl-hairy' to t.  In this case you can switch separate options off
by setting them to `null'.  Note that one may undo the extra
whitespace inserted by semis and braces in `auto-newline'-mode by
consequent M-x cperl-electric-backspace.</p>
<p>
If your site has perl5 documentation in info format, you can use commands
M-x cperl-info-on-current-command and M-x cperl-info-on-command to access it.
These keys run commands `cperl-info-on-current-command' and
`cperl-info-on-command', which one is which is controlled by variable
`cperl-info-on-command-no-prompt' and `cperl-clobber-lisp-bindings'
(in turn affected by `cperl-hairy').</p>
<p>
Even if you have no info-format documentation, short one-liner-style
help is available on M-x cperl-get-help, and one can run perldoc or
man via menu.</p>
<p>
It is possible to show this help automatically after some idle time.
This is regulated by variable `cperl-lazy-help-time'.  Default with
`cperl-hairy' (if the value of `cperl-lazy-help-time' is nil) is 5
secs idle time .  It is also possible to switch this on/off from the
menu, or via M-x cperl-toggle-autohelp.  Requires `run-with-idle-timer'.</p>
<p>
Use M-x cperl-lineup to vertically lineup some construction - put the
beginning of the region at the start of construction, and make region
span the needed amount of lines.</p>
<p>
Variables `cperl-pod-here-scan', `cperl-pod-here-fontify',
`cperl-pod-face', `cperl-pod-head-face' control processing of POD and
here-docs sections.  With capable Emaxen results of scan are used
for indentation too, otherwise they are used for highlighting only.</p>
<p>
Variables controlling indentation style:
 `cperl-tab-always-indent'
    Non-nil means TAB in CPerl mode should always reindent the current line,
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 `cperl-indent-left-aligned-comments'
    Non-nil means that the comment starting in leftmost column should indent.
 `cperl-auto-newline'
    Non-nil means automatically newline before and after braces,
    and after colons and semicolons, inserted in Perl code.  The following
    M-x cperl-electric-backspace will remove the inserted whitespace.
    Insertion after colons requires both this variable and
    `cperl-auto-newline-after-colon' set.
 `cperl-auto-newline-after-colon'
    Non-nil means automatically newline even after colons.
    Subject to `cperl-auto-newline' setting.
 `cperl-indent-level'
    Indentation of Perl statements within surrounding block.
    The surrounding block's indentation is the indentation
    of the line on which the open-brace appears.
 `cperl-continued-statement-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a substatement, such as the
    then-clause of an if, or body of a while, or just a statement continuation.
 `cperl-continued-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a brace that starts a substatement.
    This is in addition to `cperl-continued-statement-offset'.
 `cperl-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation for line if it starts with an open brace.
 `cperl-brace-imaginary-offset'
    An open brace following other text is treated as if it the line started
    this far to the right of the actual line indentation.
 `cperl-label-offset'
    Extra indentation for line that is a label.
 `cperl-min-label-indent'
    Minimal indentation for line that is a label.</p>
<p>
Settings for classic indent-styles: K&R BSD=C++ GNU PerlStyle=Whitesmith
  `cperl-indent-level'                5   4       2   4
  `cperl-brace-offset'                0   0       0   0

  `cperl-label-offset'               -5  -4      -2  -4
  `cperl-continued-statement-offset'  5   4       2   4</p>
<p>
CPerl knows several indentation styles, and may bulk set the
corresponding variables.  Use M-x cperl-set-style to do this.  Use
M-x cperl-set-style-back to restore the memorized preexisting values
(both available from menu).  See examples in `cperl-style-examples'.</p>
<p>
Part of the indentation style is how different parts of if/elsif/else
statements are broken into lines; in CPerl, this is reflected on how
templates for these constructs are created (controlled by
`cperl-extra-newline-before-brace'), and how reflow-logic should treat
"continuation" blocks of else/elsif/continue, controlled by the same
variable, and by `cperl-extra-newline-before-brace-multiline',
`cperl-merge-trailing-else', `cperl-indent-region-fix-constructs'.</p>
<p>
If `cperl-indent-level' is 0, the statement after opening brace in
column 0 is indented on
`cperl-brace-offset'+`cperl-continued-statement-offset'.</p>
<p>
Turning on CPerl mode calls the hooks in the variable `cperl-mode-hook'
with no args.</p>
<p>
DO NOT FORGET to read micro-docs (available from `Perl' menu)
or as help on variables `cperl-tips', `cperl-problems',
`cperl-praise', `cperl-speed'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="fancy-splash-insert"></a>
<h3>Function: fancy-splash-insert</h3>
Insert text into the current buffer, with faces.
Arguments from ARGS should be either strings; functions called
with no args that return a string; pairs `:face FACE', where FACE
is a face specification usable with `put-text-property'; or pairs
`:link LINK' where LINK is a list of arguments to pass to
`insert-button', of the form (LABEL ACTION [HELP-ECHO]), which
specifies the button's label, `action' property and help-echo string.
FACE and LINK can also be functions, which are evaluated to obtain
a face or button specification.</p>
<p>
(fn &rest ARGS)<a name="insert-parentheses"></a>
<h3>Function: insert-parentheses</h3>
Enclose following ARG sexps in parentheses.
Leave point after open-paren.
A negative ARG encloses the preceding ARG sexps instead.
No argument is equivalent to zero: just insert `()' and leave point between.
If `parens-require-spaces' is non-nil, this command also inserts a space
before and after, depending on the surrounding characters.
If region is active, insert enclosing characters at region boundaries.</p>
<p>
This command assumes point is not in a string or comment.<a name="default-value"></a>
<h3>Function: default-value</h3>
Return SYMBOL's default value.
This is the value that is seen in buffers that do not have their own values
for this variable.  The default value is meaningful for variables with
local bindings in certain buffers.</p>
<p>
(fn SYMBOL)<a name="byte-compile-output-file-form"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-compile-output-file-form</h3></p>
<p>

(fn FORM)<a name="next-error-follow-minor-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: next-error-follow-minor-mode</h3>
Minor mode for compilation, occur and diff modes.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable mode if ARG is positive, and
disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable mode if ARG is
omitted or nil.
When turned on, cursor motion in the compilation, grep, occur or diff
buffer causes automatic display of the corresponding source code location.<a name="combine-and-quote-strings"></a>
<h3>Function: combine-and-quote-strings</h3>
Concatenate the STRINGS, adding the SEPARATOR (default " ").
This tries to quote the strings to avoid ambiguity such that
  (split-string-and-unquote (combine-and-quote-strings strs)) == strs
Only some SEPARATORs will work properly.<a name="set-process-plist"></a>
<h3>Function: set-process-plist</h3>
Replace the plist of PROCESS with PLIST.  Returns PLIST.</p>
<p>

(fn LIST)<a name="view-echo-area-messages"></a>
<h3>Function: view-echo-area-messages</h3>
View the log of recent echo-area messages: the `*Messages*' buffer.
The number of messages retained in that buffer
is specified by the variable `message-log-max'.<a name="pcomplete/chgrp"></a>
<h3>Function: pcomplete/chgrp</h3>
Completion for the `chgrp' command.<a name="pcmpl-gnu-bzipped-files"></a>
<h3>Function: pcmpl-gnu-bzipped-files</h3>
Find all zipped or unzipped files: the inverse of UNZIP-P.</p>
<p>
(fn UNZIP-P)<a name="turn-off-flyspell"></a>
<h3>Function: turn-off-flyspell</h3>
Unconditionally turn off Flyspell mode.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="comint-previous-matching-input-string"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-previous-matching-input-string</h3>
Return the string matching REGEXP ARG places along the input ring.
Moves relative to `comint-input-ring-index'.</p>
<p>
(fn REGEXP ARG)<a name="display-time-world-display"></a>
<h3>Function: display-time-world-display</h3>
Replace current buffer text with times in various zones, based on ALIST.<a name="customize-apropos-faces"></a>

Customize all loaded faces matching REGEXP.<a name="fringe-bitmaps-at-pos"></a>
<h3>Function: fringe-bitmaps-at-pos</h3>
Return fringe bitmaps of row containing position POS in window WINDOW.
If WINDOW is nil, use selected window.  If POS is nil, use value of point
in that window.  Return value is a list (LEFT RIGHT OV), where LEFT
is the symbol for the bitmap in the left fringe (or nil if no bitmap),
RIGHT is similar for the right fringe, and OV is non-nil if there is an
overlay arrow in the left fringe.
Return nil if POS is not visible in WINDOW.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional POS WINDOW)<a name="featurep"></a>
<h3>Function: featurep</h3>
Return t if FEATURE is present in this Emacs.</p>
<p>
Use this to conditionalize execution of lisp code based on the
presence or absence of Emacs or environment extensions.
Use `provide' to declare that a feature is available.  This function
looks at the value of the variable `features'.  The optional argument
SUBFEATURE can be used to check a specific subfeature of FEATURE.</p>
<p>
(fn FEATURE &optional SUBFEATURE)<a name="custom-face-edit-convert-widget"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-face-edit-convert-widget</h3>
Convert :args as widget types in WIDGET.<a name="vc-git-revision-completion-table"></a>

<p>

(fn FILES)<a name="comint-append-output-to-file"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-append-output-to-file</h3>
Append output from interpreter since last input to FILENAME.
Any prompt at the end of the output is not written.</p>
<p>
(fn FILENAME)<a name="gnus-group-split-setup"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-group-split-setup</h3>
Set up the split for `nnmail-split-fancy'.
Sets things up so that nnmail-split-fancy is used for mail
splitting, and defines the variable nnmail-split-fancy according with
group parameters.</p>
<p>
If AUTO-UPDATE is non-nil (prefix argument accepted, if called
interactively), it makes sure nnmail-split-fancy is re-computed before
getting new mail, by adding `gnus-group-split-update' to
`nnmail-pre-get-new-mail-hook'.</p>
<p>
A non-nil CATCH-ALL replaces the current value of
`gnus-group-split-default-catch-all-group'.  This variable is only used
by gnus-group-split-update, and only when its CATCH-ALL argument is
nil.  This argument may contain any fancy split, that will be added as
the last split in a `|' split produced by `gnus-group-split-fancy',
unless overridden by any group marked as a catch-all group.  Typical
uses are as simple as the name of a default mail group, but more
elaborate fancy splits may also be useful to split mail that doesn't
match any of the group-specified splitting rules.  See
`gnus-group-split-fancy' for details.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional AUTO-UPDATE CATCH-ALL)<a name="face-attr-match-p"></a>
<h3>Function: face-attr-match-p</h3>
Return t if attributes of FACE match values in plist ATTRS.
Optional parameter FRAME is the frame whose definition of FACE
is used.  If nil or omitted, use the selected frame.<a name="flycheck-package--check-packages-installable"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-package--check-packages-installable</h3>
Cannot open doc string file "/home/lars/.emacs.d/elpa/flycheck-package-20160919.747/flycheck-package.elc"
<a name="diff-hunk-text"></a>
<h3>Function: diff-hunk-text</h3>
Return the literal source text from HUNK as (TEXT . OFFSET).
If DESTP is nil, TEXT is the source, otherwise the destination text.
CHAR-OFFSET is a char-offset in HUNK, and OFFSET is the corresponding
char-offset in TEXT.</p>
<p>
(fn HUNK DESTP CHAR-OFFSET)<a name="todo-show"></a>
<h3>Function: todo-show</h3>
Show TODO list.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="table-insert"></a>
<h3>Function: table-insert</h3>
Insert an editable text table.
Insert a table of specified number of COLUMNS and ROWS.  Optional
parameter CELL-WIDTH and CELL-HEIGHT can specify the size of each
cell.  The cell size is uniform across the table if the specified size
is a number.  They can be a list of numbers to specify different size
for each cell.  When called interactively, the list of number is
entered by simply listing all the numbers with space characters
delimiting them.</p>
<p>
Examples:</p>
<p>
M-x table-insert inserts a table at the current point location.</p>
<p>
Suppose we have the following situation where `-!-' indicates the
location of point.</p>
<p>
    -!-</p>
<p>
Type M-x table-insert and hit ENTER key.  As it asks table
specification, provide 3 for number of columns, 1 for number of rows,
5 for cell width and 1 for cell height.  Now you shall see the next
table and the point is automatically moved to the beginning of the
first cell.</p>
<p>
    +-----+-----+-----+
    |-!-  |     |     |
    +-----+-----+-----+</p>
<p>
Inside a table cell, there are special key bindings. 
Uses keymap `table-cell-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

M-9 M-x table-widen-cell (or C-u 9 M-x table-widen-cell) widens the first cell by 9 character
width, which results as</p>
<p>
    +--------------+-----+-----+
    |-!-           |     |     |
    +--------------+-----+-----+</p>
<p>
Type TAB M-x table-widen-cell then type TAB M-2 M-7 M-x table-widen-cell (or C-u 2 7 M-x table-widen-cell).  Typing
TAB moves the point forward by a cell. The result now looks like this:</p>
<p>
    +--------------+------+--------------------------------+
    |              |      |-!-                             |
    +--------------+------+--------------------------------+</p>
<p>
If you knew each width of the columns prior to the table creation,
what you could have done better was to have had given the complete
width information to `table-insert'.</p>
<p>
Cell width(s): 14 6 32</p>
<p>
instead of</p>
<p>
Cell width(s): 5</p>
<p>
This would have eliminated the previously mentioned width adjustment
work all together.</p>
<p>
If the point is in the last cell type S-TAB S-TAB to move it to the
first cell.  Now type M-x table-heighten-cell which heighten the row by a line.</p>
<p>
    +--------------+------+--------------------------------+
    |-!-           |      |                                |

    +--------------+------+--------------------------------+</p>
<p>
Type M-x table-insert-row-column and tell it to insert a row.</p>
<p>
    +--------------+------+--------------------------------+

<p>
Move the point under the table as shown below.</p>
<p>
    +--------------+------+--------------------------------+

    +--------------+------+--------------------------------+
    -!-</p>
<p>
Type M-x table-insert-row instead of M-x table-insert-row-column.  M-x table-insert-row-column does not work
when the point is outside of the table.  This insertion at
outside of the table effectively appends a row at the end.</p>

Inside a table cell has a special keymap.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `table-cell-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

(fn COLUMNS ROWS &optional CELL-WIDTH CELL-HEIGHT)<a name="erc-track-minor-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: erc-track-minor-mode</h3>
Toggle mode line display of ERC activity (ERC Track minor mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable ERC Track minor mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
ERC Track minor mode is a global minor mode.  It exists for the
sole purpose of providing the C-c C-SPC and C-c C-@ keybindings.
Make sure that you have enabled the track module, otherwise the
keybindings will not do anything useful.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="pending-delete-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: pending-delete-mode</h3>
Toggle Delete Selection mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Delete Selection mode if ARG
is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,
enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When Delete Selection mode is enabled, Transient Mark mode is also
enabled and typed text replaces the selection if the selection is
active.  Otherwise, typed text is just inserted at point regardless of
any selection.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="eval-current-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: eval-current-buffer</h3>
Execute the current buffer as Lisp code.
When called from a Lisp program (i.e., not interactively), this
function accepts up to five optional arguments:
BUFFER is the buffer to evaluate (nil means use current buffer).
PRINTFLAG controls printing of output:
 A value of nil means discard it; anything else is stream for print.
FILENAME specifies the file name to use for `load-history'.
UNIBYTE, if non-nil, specifies `load-convert-to-unibyte' for this
 invocation.
DO-ALLOW-PRINT, if non-nil, specifies that `print' and related
 functions should work normally even if PRINTFLAG is nil.</p>
<p>
This function preserves the position of point.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional BUFFER PRINTFLAG FILENAME UNIBYTE DO-ALLOW-PRINT)<a name="abbrev--describe"></a>
<h3>Function: abbrev--describe</h3></p>
<p>

(fn SYM)<a name="sort-pages"></a>
<h3>Function: sort-pages</h3>
Sort pages in region alphabetically; argument means descending order.
Called from a program, there are three arguments:
REVERSE (non-nil means reverse order), BEG and END (region to sort).
The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects
the sort order.</p>
<p>
(fn REVERSE BEG END)<a name="shr-insert-document"></a>
<h3>Function: shr-insert-document</h3>
Render the parsed document DOM into the current buffer.
DOM should be a parse tree as generated by
`libxml-parse-html-region' or similar.</p>
<p>
(fn DOM)<a name="back-to-indentation"></a>
<h3>Function: back-to-indentation</h3>
Move point to the first non-whitespace character on this line.<a name="url-http"></a>
<h3>Function: url-http</h3>
Retrieve URL via HTTP asynchronously.
URL must be a parsed URL.  See `url-generic-parse-url' for details.</p>
<p>
When retrieval is completed, execute the function CALLBACK, using
the arguments listed in CBARGS.  The first element in CBARGS
should be a plist describing what has happened so far during the
request, as described in the docstring of `url-retrieve' (if in
doubt, specify nil).</p>
<p>
Optional arg RETRY-BUFFER, if non-nil, specifies the buffer of a
previous `url-http' call, which is being re-attempted.<a name="current-frame-configuration"></a>
<h3>Function: current-frame-configuration</h3>
Return a list describing the positions and states of all frames.
Its car is `frame-configuration'.
Each element of the cdr is a list of the form (FRAME ALIST WINDOW-CONFIG),
where
  FRAME is a frame object,
  ALIST is an association list specifying some of FRAME's parameters, and
  WINDOW-CONFIG is a window configuration object for FRAME.<a name="rng-validate-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: rng-validate-mode</h3>
Minor mode performing continual validation against a RELAX NG schema.</p>
<p>
Checks whether the buffer is a well-formed XML 1.0 document,
conforming to the XML Namespaces Recommendation and valid against a
RELAX NG schema.  The mode-line indicates whether it is or not.  Any
parts of the buffer that cause it not to be are considered errors and
are highlighted with face `rng-error'.  A description of each error is
available as a tooltip.  M-x rng-next-error goes to the next error
after point.  Clicking mouse-1 on the word `Invalid' in the mode-line
goes to the first error in the buffer.  If the buffer changes, then it
will be automatically rechecked when Emacs becomes idle; the
rechecking will be paused whenever there is input pending.</p>
<p>
By default, uses a vacuous schema that allows any well-formed XML
document.  A schema can be specified explicitly using
M-x rng-set-schema-file-and-validate, or implicitly based on the buffer's
file name or on the root element name.  In each case the schema must
be a RELAX NG schema using the compact schema (such schemas
conventionally have a suffix of `.rnc').  The variable
`rng-schema-locating-files' specifies files containing rules
to use for finding the schema.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG NO-CHANGE-SCHEMA)<a name="tags-loop-continue"></a>
<h3>Function: tags-loop-continue</h3>
Continue last M-x tags-search or M-x tags-query-replace command.
Used noninteractively with non-nil argument to begin such a command (the
argument is passed to `next-file', which see).</p>
<p>
Two variables control the processing we do on each file: the value of
`tags-loop-scan' is a form to be executed on each file to see if it is
interesting (it returns non-nil if so) and `tags-loop-operate' is a form to
evaluate to operate on an interesting file.  If the latter evaluates to

(fn)<a name="fringe-query-style"></a>
<h3>Function: fringe-query-style</h3>
Query user for fringe style.
Returns values suitable for left-fringe and right-fringe frame parameters.
If ALL-FRAMES, the negation of the fringe values in

frame parameter is used.<a name="split-window-horizontally"></a>
<h3>Function: split-window-horizontally</h3>
Split the selected window into two side-by-side windows.
The selected window is on the left.  The newly split-off window
is on the right, and displays the same buffer.  Return the new
window.</p>
<p>
If optional argument SIZE is omitted or nil, both windows get the
same width, or close to it.  If SIZE is positive, the left-hand
(selected) window gets SIZE columns.  If SIZE is negative, the
right-hand (new) window gets -SIZE columns.  Here, SIZE includes
the width of the window's scroll bar; if there are no scroll
bars, it includes the width of the divider column to the window's
right, if any.<a name="window-next-sibling"></a>
<h3>Function: window-next-sibling</h3>

(fn &optional WINDOW)<a name="eval-minibuffer"></a>
<h3>Function: eval-minibuffer</h3>
Return value of Lisp expression read using the minibuffer.
Prompt with PROMPT.  If non-nil, optional second arg INITIAL-CONTENTS
is a string to insert in the minibuffer before reading.
(INITIAL-CONTENTS can also be a cons of a string and an integer.
Such arguments are used as in `read-from-minibuffer'.)</p>
<p>
(fn PROMPT &optional INITIAL-CONTENTS)<a name="called-interactively-p"></a>
<h3>Function: called-interactively-p</h3>
Return t if the containing function was called by `call-interactively'.
If KIND is `interactive', then only return t if the call was made
interactively by the user, i.e. not in `noninteractive' mode nor
when `executing-kbd-macro'.
If KIND is `any', on the other hand, it will return t for any kind of
interactive call, including being called as the binding of a key, or
from a keyboard macro, or in `noninteractive' mode.</p>
<p>
The only known proper use of `interactive' for KIND is in deciding
whether to display a helpful message, or how to display it.  If you're
thinking of using it for any other purpose, it is quite likely that
you're making a mistake.  Think: what do you want to do when the
command is called from a keyboard macro?</p>
<p>
Instead of using this function, it is sometimes cleaner to give your
function an extra optional argument whose `interactive' spec specifies
non-nil unconditionally ("p" is a good way to do this), or via
(not (or executing-kbd-macro noninteractive)).</p>
<p>
(fn &optional KIND)<a name="cl--position"></a>

<p>
(fn)<a name="cl-multiple-value-apply"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-multiple-value-apply</h3>
Evaluate EXPRESSION to get multiple values and apply FUNCTION to them.

The copy starts out with the same definitions of KEYMAP,
but changing either the copy or KEYMAP does not affect the other.
Any key definitions that are subkeymaps are recursively copied.
However, a key definition which is a symbol whose definition is a keymap
is not copied.</p>
<p>
(fn KEYMAP)<a name="pcmpl-gnu-make-rule-names"></a>

BUFFER, if non-nil, should be a buffer to use; the default is
named *Custom Theme*.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional THEME BUFFER)<a name="float-time"></a>
<h3>Function: float-time</h3>
Return the current time, as a float number of seconds since the epoch.
If SPECIFIED-TIME is given, it is the time to convert to float
instead of the current time.  The argument should have the form
(HIGH LOW) or (HIGH LOW USEC) or (HIGH LOW USEC PSEC).  Thus,
you can use times from `current-time' and from `file-attributes'.
SPECIFIED-TIME can also have the form (HIGH . LOW), but this is
considered obsolete.</p>
<p>
WARNING: Since the result is floating point, it may not be exact.
If precise time stamps are required, use either `current-time',
or (if you need time as a string) `format-time-string'.</p>

<h3>Function: fill-french-nobreak-p</h3>
Return nil if French style allows breaking the line at point.
This is used in `fill-nobreak-predicate' to prevent breaking lines just
after an opening paren or just before a closing paren or a punctuation

<h3>Function: help-setup-xref</h3>
Invoked from commands using the "*Help*" buffer to install some xref info.</p>
<p>
ITEM is a (FUNCTION . ARGS) pair appropriate for recreating the help
buffer after following a reference.  INTERACTIVE-P is non-nil if the
calling command was invoked interactively.  In this case the stack of
items for help buffer "back" buttons is cleared.</p>
<p>
This should be called very early, before the output buffer is cleared,
because we want to record the "previous" position of point so we can
restore it properly when going back.<a name="mail-mode"></a>

<h3>Function: diff-file-prev</h3>
Go to the previous COUNT'th file</p>
<p>
(fn &optional COUNT)<a name="menu-bar-positive-p"></a>
<h3>Function: menu-bar-positive-p</h3>
Return non-nil iff VAL is a positive number.<a name="filter-buffer-substring"></a>
<h3>Function: filter-buffer-substring</h3>
Return the buffer substring between BEG and END, after filtering.
The wrapper hook `filter-buffer-substring-functions' performs
the actual filtering.  The obsolete variable `buffer-substring-filters'
is also consulted.  If both of these are nil, no filtering is done.</p>
<p>
If DELETE is non-nil, the text between BEG and END is deleted
from the buffer.</p>
<p>
This function should be used instead of `buffer-substring',
`buffer-substring-no-properties', or `delete-and-extract-region'
when you want to allow filtering to take place.  For example,
major or minor modes can use `filter-buffer-substring-functions' to
extract characters that are special to a buffer, and should not
be copied into other buffers.<a name="gnus-add-to-sorted-list"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-add-to-sorted-list</h3>
Add NUM into sorted LIST by side effect.</p>
<p>
(fn LIST NUM)<a name="epatch-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: epatch-buffer</h3>
Run Ediff by patching the buffer specified at prompt.
Without the optional prefix ARG, asks if the patch is in some buffer and
prompts for the buffer or a file, depending on the answer.
With ARG=1, assumes the patch is in a file and prompts for the file.
With ARG=2, assumes the patch is in a buffer and prompts for the buffer.
PATCH-BUF is an optional argument, which specifies the buffer that contains the
patch. If not given, the user is prompted according to the prefix argument.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG PATCH-BUF)<a name="x-display-pixel-width"></a>
<h3>Function: x-display-pixel-width</h3>
Return the width in pixels of the X display TERMINAL.
The optional argument TERMINAL specifies which display to ask about.
TERMINAL should be a terminal object, a frame or a display name (a string).
If omitted or nil, that stands for the selected frame's display.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional TERMINAL)<a name="mm-mule-charset-to-mime-charset"></a>
<h3>Function: mm-mule-charset-to-mime-charset</h3>
Return the MIME charset corresponding to the given Mule CHARSET.<a name="url-tn3270"></a>

(fn URL)<a name="days-to-time"></a>
<h3>Function: days-to-time</h3>
Convert DAYS into a time value.<a name="documentation"></a>
<h3>Function: documentation</h3>
Return the documentation string of FUNCTION.
Unless a non-nil second argument RAW is given, the
string is passed through `substitute-command-keys'.</p>
<p>
(fn FUNCTION &optional RAW)<a name="flycheck-puppet-lint-disabled-arg-name"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-puppet-lint-disabled-arg-name</h3>
Create an argument to disable a puppetlint CHECK.<a name="ert-running-test"></a>
<h3>Function: ert-running-test</h3>
Return the top-level test currently executing.<a name="server-clients-with"></a>
<h3>Function: server-clients-with</h3>
Return a list of clients with PROPERTY set to VALUE.</p>
<p>
(fn PROPERTY VALUE)<a name="cua-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: cua-mode</h3>
Toggle Common User Access style editing (CUA mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable CUA mode if ARG is positive,
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode
if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
CUA mode is a global minor mode.  When enabled, typed text
replaces the active selection, and you can use C-z, C-x, C-c, and
C-v to undo, cut, copy, and paste in addition to the normal Emacs
bindings.  The C-x and C-c keys only do cut and copy when the
region is active, so in most cases, they do not conflict with the
normal function of these prefix keys.</p>
<p>
If you really need to perform a command which starts with one of
the prefix keys even when the region is active, you have three
options:
- press the prefix key twice very quickly (within 0.2 seconds),
- press the prefix key and the following key within 0.2 seconds, or
- use the SHIFT key with the prefix key, i.e. C-S-x or C-S-c.</p>
<p>
You can customize `cua-enable-cua-keys' to completely disable the
CUA bindings, or `cua-prefix-override-inhibit-delay' to change
the prefix fallback behavior.</p>
<p>
CUA mode manages Transient Mark mode internally.  Trying to disable
Transient Mark mode while CUA mode is enabled does not work; if you
only want to highlight the region when it is selected using a
shifted movement key, set `cua-highlight-region-shift-only'.</p>

(fn WIDGET)<a name="dired-goto-file-1"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-goto-file-1</h3>
Advance to the Dired listing labeled by FILE; return its position.
Return nil if the listing is not found.  If FILE contains
characters that would not appear in a Dired buffer, search using
the quoted forms of those characters.</p>
<p>
FULL-NAME specifies the actual file name the listing must have,
as returned by `dired-get-filename'.  LIMIT is the search limit.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE FULL-NAME LIMIT)<a name="Info-copy-current-node-name"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-copy-current-node-name</h3>
Put the name of the current Info node into the kill ring.
The name of the Info file is prepended to the node name in parentheses.

<h3>Function: debugger-continue</h3>
Continue, evaluating this expression without stopping.<a name="phases-of-moon"></a>
<h3>Function: phases-of-moon</h3>
Display the quarters of the moon for last month, this month, and next month.
If called with an optional prefix argument ARG, prompts for month and year.
This function is suitable for execution in an init file.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="bookmark-delete"></a>
<h3>Function: bookmark-delete</h3>
Delete BOOKMARK-NAME from the bookmark list.</p>
<p>
Removes only the first instance of a bookmark with that name.  If
there are one or more other bookmarks with the same name, they will
not be deleted.  Defaults to the "current" bookmark (that is, the
one most recently used in this file, if any).
Optional second arg BATCH means don't update the bookmark list buffer,
probably because we were called from there.</p>
<p>
(fn BOOKMARK-NAME &optional BATCH)<a name="buffer-live-p"></a>
<h3>Function: buffer-live-p</h3>
Return non-nil if OBJECT is a buffer which has not been killed.
Value is nil if OBJECT is not a buffer or if it has been killed.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT)<a name="file-writable-p"></a>

When called interactively, prompt for the name of the color to use.
To get the frame's current mouse color, use `frame-parameters'.<a name="string-to-list"></a>
<h3>Function: string-to-list</h3>
Return a list of characters in STRING.<a name="mail-add-payment"></a>
<h3>Function: mail-add-payment</h3>
Add X-Payment: and X-Hashcash: headers with a hashcash payment
for each recipient address.  Prefix arg sets default payment temporarily.
Set ASYNC to t to start asynchronous calculation.  (See
`mail-add-payment-async').</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG ASYNC)<a name="display-buffer-in-major-side-window"></a>
<h3>Function: display-buffer-in-major-side-window</h3>
Display BUFFER in a new window on SIDE of the selected frame.
SIDE must be one of `left', `top', `right' or `bottom'.  SLOT
specifies the slot to use.  ALIST is an association list of
symbols and values as passed to `display-buffer-in-side-window'.
This function may be called only if no window on SIDE exists yet.
The new window automatically becomes the "major" side window on
SIDE.  Return the new window, nil if its creation window failed.<a name="password-reset"></a>
<h3>Function: password-reset</h3>
Clear the password cache.<a name="text-mode-hook-identify"></a>
<h3>Function: text-mode-hook-identify</h3>
Mark that this mode has run `text-mode-hook'.
This is how `toggle-text-mode-auto-fill' knows which buffers to operate on.<a name="highlight-compare-buffers"></a>
<h3>Function: highlight-compare-buffers</h3>
Compare two buffers and highlight the differences.</p>
<p>
The default is the current buffer and the one in the next window.</p>
<p>
If either buffer is modified and is visiting a file, you are prompted
to save the file.</p>
<p>
Unless the buffer is unmodified and visiting a file, the buffer is
written to a temporary file for comparison.</p>
<p>
If a buffer is read-only, differences will be highlighted but no property
changes are made, so M-x highlight-changes-next-change and
M-x highlight-changes-previous-change will not work.</p>
<p>
(fn BUF-A BUF-B)<a name="global-key-binding"></a>
<h3>Function: global-key-binding</h3>
Return the binding for command KEYS in current global keymap only.
KEYS is a string or vector, a sequence of keystrokes.
The binding is probably a symbol with a function definition.
This function's return values are the same as those of `lookup-key'
(which see).</p>
<p>
If optional argument ACCEPT-DEFAULT is non-nil, recognize default
bindings; see the description of `lookup-key' for more details about this.</p>
<p>
(fn KEYS &optional ACCEPT-DEFAULT)<a name="Custom-save"></a>
<h3>Function: Custom-save</h3>
Set all edited settings, then save all settings that have been set.

START should be at the beginning of a line.<a name="org-agenda-list"></a>
<h3>Function: org-agenda-list</h3>
Produce a daily/weekly view from all files in variable `org-agenda-files'.
The view will be for the current day or week, but from the overview buffer
you will be able to go to other days/weeks.</p>
<p>
With a numeric prefix argument in an interactive call, the agenda will
span ARG days.  Lisp programs should instead specify SPAN to change
the number of days.  SPAN defaults to `org-agenda-span'.</p>
<p>
START-DAY defaults to TODAY, or to the most recent match for the weekday
given in `org-agenda-start-on-weekday'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG START-DAY SPAN)<a name="put-charset-property"></a>
<h3>Function: put-charset-property</h3>

<h3>Function: match-beginning</h3>
Return position of start of text matched by last search.
SUBEXP, a number, specifies which parenthesized expression in the last
  regexp.
Value is nil if SUBEXPth pair didn't match, or there were less than
  SUBEXP pairs.
Zero means the entire text matched by the whole regexp or whole string.</p>
<p>
(fn SUBEXP)<a name="dash--match-symbol"></a>
<h3>Function: dash--match-symbol</h3>
Bind a symbol.</p>
<p>
This works just like `let', there is no destructuring.</p>
<p>
(fn MATCH-FORM SOURCE)<a name="custom-theme-set-faces"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-theme-set-faces</h3>
Initialize faces for theme THEME.
The arguments should be a list where each entry has the form:</p>
<p>
  (FACE SPEC [NOW [COMMENT]])</p>
<p>
SPEC is stored as the saved value for FACE, as well as the value for the
`user' theme.  The `user' theme is one of the default themes known to Emacs.
See `custom-known-themes' for more information on the known themes.
See `custom-theme-set-faces' for more information on the interplay
between themes and faces.
See `defface' for the format of SPEC.</p>
<p>
If NOW is present and non-nil, FACE is created now, according to SPEC.
COMMENT is a string comment about FACE.</p>
<p>
Several properties of THEME and FACE are used in the process:</p>
<p>
If THEME property `theme-immediate' is non-nil, this is equivalent of
providing the NOW argument to all faces in the argument list: FACE is
created now.  The only difference is FACE property `force-face': if NOW
is non-nil, FACE property `force-face' is set to the symbol `rogue', else
if THEME property `theme-immediate' is non-nil, FACE property `force-face'
is set to the symbol `immediate'.</p>
<p>
SPEC itself is saved in FACE property `saved-face' and it is stored in
FACE's list property `theme-face' (using `custom-push-theme').<a name="frame-current-scroll-bars"></a>
<h3>Function: frame-current-scroll-bars</h3>
Return the current scroll-bar settings in frame FRAME.
Value is a cons (VERTICAL . HORIZ0NTAL) where VERTICAL specifies the

or it might return the position of the end of the line.<a name="image-dired-dired-display-external"></a>
<h3>Function: image-dired-dired-display-external</h3>
Display file at point using an external viewer.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="help-at-pt-kbd-string"></a>
<h3>Function: help-at-pt-kbd-string</h3>
Return the keyboard help string at point.
If the `kbd-help' text or overlay property at point produces a
string, return it.  Otherwise, use the `help-echo' property.
If this produces no string either, return nil.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="unencodable-char-position"></a>
<h3>Function: unencodable-char-position</h3>
Return position of first un-encodable character in a region.
START and END specify the region and CODING-SYSTEM specifies the
encoding to check.  Return nil if CODING-SYSTEM does encode the region.</p>
<p>
If optional 4th argument COUNT is non-nil, it specifies at most how
many un-encodable characters to search.  In this case, the value is a
list of positions.</p>
<p>
If optional 5th argument STRING is non-nil, it is a string to search
for un-encodable characters.  In that case, START and END are indexes
to the string.</p>
<p>
(fn START END CODING-SYSTEM &optional COUNT STRING)<a name="-replace-last"></a>

<h3>Function: buffer-face-set</h3>
Enable `buffer-face-mode', using face specs SPECS.
Each argument in SPECS should be a face, i.e. either a face name
or a property list of face attributes and values.  If more than
one face is listed, that specifies an aggregate face, like in a
`face' text property.  If SPECS is nil or omitted, disable
`buffer-face-mode'.</p>

<h3>Function: yow</h3>
Return or display a random Zippy quotation.  With prefix arg, insert it.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional INSERT DISPLAY)<a name="find-tag-other-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: find-tag-other-frame</h3>
Find tag (in current tags table) whose name contains TAGNAME.
Select the buffer containing the tag's definition in another frame, and
move point there.  The default for TAGNAME is the expression in the buffer
around or before point.</p>
<p>
If second arg NEXT-P is t (interactively, with prefix arg), search for
another tag that matches the last tagname or regexp used.  When there are
multiple matches for a tag, more exact matches are found first.  If NEXT-P
is negative (interactively, with prefix arg that is a negative number or
just M--), pop back to the previous tag gone to.</p>
<p>
If third arg REGEXP-P is non-nil, treat TAGNAME as a regexp.</p>
<p>
A marker representing the point when this command is invoked is pushed
onto a ring and may be popped back to with M-*.
Contrast this with the ring of marks gone to by the command.</p>

<h3>Function: table-release</h3>
Convert a table into plain text by removing the frame from a table.
Remove the frame from a table and deactivate the table.  This command
converts a table into plain text without frames.  It is a companion to
`table-capture' which does the opposite process.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="pp-to-string"></a>
<h3>Function: pp-to-string</h3>
Return a string containing the pretty-printed representation of OBJECT.
OBJECT can be any Lisp object.  Quoting characters are used as needed
to make output that `read' can handle, whenever this is possible.<a name="makefile-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: makefile-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing standard Makefiles.</p>
<p>
If you are editing a file for a different make, try one of the
variants `makefile-automake-mode', `makefile-gmake-mode',
`makefile-makepp-mode', `makefile-bsdmake-mode' or,
`makefile-imake-mode'.  All but the last should be correctly
chosen based on the file name, except if it is *.mk.  This
function ends by invoking the function(s) `makefile-mode-hook'.</p>
<p>
It is strongly recommended to use `font-lock-mode', because that
provides additional parsing information.  This is used for
example to see that a rule action `echo foo: bar' is a not rule
dependency, despite the colon.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `makefile-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

In the browser, use the following keys:</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `makefile-browser-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

Makefile mode can be configured by modifying the following variables:</p>
<p>
`makefile-browser-buffer-name':
    Name of the macro- and target browser buffer.</p>
<p>
`makefile-target-colon':
    The string that gets appended to all target names
    inserted by `makefile-insert-target'.
    ":" or "::" are quite common values.</p>
<p>
`makefile-macro-assign':
   The string that gets appended to all macro names
   inserted by `makefile-insert-macro'.
   The normal value should be " = ", since this is what
   standard make expects.  However, newer makes such as dmake
   allow a larger variety of different macro assignments, so you
   might prefer to use " += " or " := " .</p>
<p>
`makefile-tab-after-target-colon':
   If you want a TAB (instead of a space) to be appended after the
   target colon, then set this to a non-nil value.</p>
<p>
`makefile-browser-leftmost-column':
   Number of blanks to the left of the browser selection mark.</p>
<p>
`makefile-browser-cursor-column':
   Column in which the cursor is positioned when it moves
   up or down in the browser.</p>
<p>
`makefile-browser-selected-mark':
   String used to mark selected entries in the browser.</p>
<p>
`makefile-browser-unselected-mark':
   String used to mark unselected entries in the browser.</p>
<p>
`makefile-browser-auto-advance-after-selection-p':
   If this variable is set to a non-nil value the cursor
   will automagically advance to the next line after an item
   has been selected in the browser.</p>
<p>
`makefile-pickup-everything-picks-up-filenames-p':
   If this variable is set to a non-nil value then
   `makefile-pickup-everything' also picks up filenames as targets
   (i.e. it calls `makefile-pickup-filenames-as-targets'), otherwise
   filenames are omitted.</p>
<p>
`makefile-cleanup-continuations':
   If this variable is set to a non-nil value then Makefile mode
   will assure that no line in the file ends with a backslash
   (the continuation character) followed by any whitespace.
   This is done by silently removing the trailing whitespace, leaving
   the backslash itself intact.
   IMPORTANT: Please note that enabling this option causes Makefile mode
   to MODIFY A FILE WITHOUT YOUR CONFIRMATION when "it seems necessary".</p>
<p>
`makefile-browser-hook':
   A function or list of functions to be called just before the
   browser is entered. This is executed in the makefile buffer.</p>
<p>
`makefile-special-targets-list':
   List of special targets. You will be offered to complete
   on one of those in the minibuffer whenever you enter a `.'.
   at the beginning of a line in Makefile mode.</p>

names.  Only the files that are under revision control are taken into account.</p>
<p>
(fn DIR1 REGEXP)<a name="ebnf-despool"></a>
<h3>Function: ebnf-despool</h3>
Send the spooled PostScript to the printer.</p>
<p>
Interactively, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the
user for a file name, and saves the spooled PostScript image in that file
instead of sending it to the printer.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, the argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it is nil,
send the image to the printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save the PostScript
image in a file with that name.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FILENAME)<a name="set-face-italic-p"></a>
<h3>Function: set-face-italic-p</h3>
Specify whether face FACE is italic.
ITALIC-P non-nil means FACE should explicitly display italic.

:test TEST -- TEST must be a symbol that specifies how to compare
keys.  Default is `eql'.  Predefined are the tests `eq', `eql', and
`equal'.  User-supplied test and hash functions can be specified via
`define-hash-table-test'.</p>
<p>
:size SIZE -- A hint as to how many elements will be put in the table.
Default is 65.</p>
<p>
:rehash-size REHASH-SIZE - Indicates how to expand the table when it
fills up.  If REHASH-SIZE is an integer, increase the size by that
amount.  If it is a float, it must be > 1.0, and the new size is the
old size multiplied by that factor.  Default is 1.5.</p>
<p>
:rehash-threshold THRESHOLD -- THRESHOLD must a float > 0, and <= 1.0.
Resize the hash table when the ratio (number of entries / table size)
is greater than or equal to THRESHOLD.  Default is 0.8.</p>
<p>
:weakness WEAK -- WEAK must be one of nil, t, `key', `value',
`key-or-value', or `key-and-value'.  If WEAK is not nil, the table
returned is a weak table.  Key/value pairs are removed from a weak
hash table when there are no non-weak references pointing to their
key, value, one of key or value, or both key and value, depending on
WEAK.  WEAK t is equivalent to `key-and-value'.  Default value of WEAK
is nil.</p>

<p>
(fn &optional ARG PATCH-BUF)<a name="x-send-client-message"></a>
<h3>Function: x-send-client-message</h3>
Send a client message of MESSAGE-TYPE to window DEST on DISPLAY.</p>
<p>
For DISPLAY, specify either a frame or a display name (a string).
If DISPLAY is nil, that stands for the selected frame's display.
DEST may be a number, in which case it is a Window id.  The value 0 may
be used to send to the root window of the DISPLAY.
If DEST is a cons, it is converted to a 32 bit number
with the high 16 bits from the car and the lower 16 bit from the cdr.  That
number is then used as a window id.
If DEST is a frame the event is sent to the outer window of that frame.
A value of nil means the currently selected frame.
If DEST is the string "PointerWindow" the event is sent to the window that
contains the pointer.  If DEST is the string "InputFocus" the event is
sent to the window that has the input focus.
FROM is the frame sending the event.  Use nil for currently selected frame.
MESSAGE-TYPE is the name of an Atom as a string.
FORMAT must be one of 8, 16 or 32 and determines the size of the values in
bits.  VALUES is a list of numbers, cons and/or strings containing the values
to send.  If a value is a string, it is converted to an Atom and the value of
the Atom is sent.  If a value is a cons, it is converted to a 32 bit number
with the high 16 bits from the car and the lower 16 bit from the cdr.
If more values than fits into the event is given, the excessive values
are ignored.</p>

Move point to beginning of current line (in the logical order).
With argument N not nil or 1, move forward N - 1 lines first.
If point reaches the beginning or end of buffer, it stops there.</p>
<p>
This function constrains point to the current field unless this moves
point to a different line than the original, unconstrained result.
If N is nil or 1, and a front-sticky field starts at point, the point
does not move.  To ignore field boundaries bind
`inhibit-field-text-motion' to t, or use the `forward-line' function
instead.  For instance, `(forward-line 0)' does the same thing as
`(beginning-of-line)', except that it ignores field boundaries.</p>

around the region text.</p>
<p>
A prefix argument ARG says to wrap the skeleton around the next ARG words.
A prefix argument of -1 says to wrap around region, even if not highlighted.
A prefix argument of zero says to wrap around zero words---that is, nothing.
This is a way of overriding the use of a highlighted region.<a name="flycheck-error-level-fringe-face"></a>

<h3>Function: sql-interbase</h3>
Run isql by Interbase as an inferior process.</p>
<p>
If buffer `*SQL*' exists but no process is running, make a new process.
If buffer exists and a process is running, just switch to buffer
`*SQL*'.</p>
<p>
Interpreter used comes from variable `sql-interbase-program'.  Login
uses the variables `sql-user', `sql-password', and `sql-database' as
defaults, if set.</p>
<p>
The buffer is put in SQL interactive mode, giving commands for sending
input.  See `sql-interactive-mode'.</p>
<p>
To set the buffer name directly, use C-u
before M-x sql-interbase.  Once session has started,
M-x sql-rename-buffer can be called separately to rename the
buffer.</p>
<p>
To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the input and output to the process, use C-x RET c
before M-x sql-interbase.  You can also specify this with C-x RET p
in the SQL buffer, after you start the process.
The default comes from `process-coding-system-alist' and
`default-process-coding-system'.</p>

We put that list in a buffer, and display the buffer.</p>
<p>
The optional argument PREFIX, if non-nil, should be a key sequence;
then we display only bindings that start with that prefix.
The optional argument BUFFER specifies which buffer's bindings
to display (default, the current buffer).  BUFFER can be a buffer
or a buffer name.<a name="array-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: array-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing arrays.</p>
<p>
  Array mode is a specialized mode for editing arrays.  An array is
considered to be a two-dimensional set of strings.  The strings are
NOT recognized as integers or real numbers.</p>
<p>
  The array MUST reside at the top of the buffer.</p>
<p>
  TABs are not respected, and may be converted into spaces at any time.
Setting the variable `array-respect-tabs' to non-nil will prevent TAB conversion,
but will cause many functions to give errors if they encounter one.</p>
<p>
  Upon entering array mode, you will be prompted for the values of
several variables.  Others will be calculated based on the values you
supply.  These variables are all local to the buffer.  Other buffer
in array mode may have different values assigned to the variables.
The variables are:</p>
<p>
Variables you assign:
     array-max-row:          The number of rows in the array.
     array-max-column:       The number of columns in the array.
     array-columns-per-line: The number of columns in the array per line of buffer.
     array-field-width:      The width of each field, in characters.
     array-rows-numbered:    A logical variable describing whether to ignore
                       row numbers in the buffer.</p>
<p>
Variables which are calculated:
     array-line-length:      The number of characters in a buffer line.
     array-lines-per-row:    The number of buffer lines used to display each row.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: blackbox</h3>
Play blackbox.
Optional prefix argument is the number of balls; the default is 4.</p>
<p>
What is blackbox?</p>
<p>
Blackbox is a game of hide and seek played on an 8 by 8 grid (the
Blackbox).  Your opponent (Emacs, in this case) has hidden several
balls (usually 4) within this box.  By shooting rays into the box and
observing where they emerge it is possible to deduce the positions of
the hidden balls.  The fewer rays you use to find the balls, the lower
your score.</p>
<p>
Overview of play:</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `blackbox-mode-map', which is not currently defined.
To play blackbox, type M-x blackbox.  An optional prefix argument
specifies the number of balls to be hidden in the box; the default is
four.</p>
<p>
The cursor can be moved around the box with the standard cursor
movement keys.</p>
<p>
To shoot a ray, move the cursor to the edge of the box and press SPC.
The result will be determined and the playfield updated.</p>
<p>
You may place or remove balls in the box by moving the cursor into the
box and pressing M-x bb-romp.</p>
<p>
When you think the configuration of balls you have placed is correct,
press M-x bb-done.  You will be informed whether you are correct or
not, and be given your score.  Your score is the number of letters and
numbers around the outside of the box plus five for each incorrectly
placed ball.  If you placed any balls incorrectly, they will be
indicated with `x', and their actual positions indicated with `o'.</p>
<p>
Details:</p>
<p>
There are three possible outcomes for each ray you send into the box:</p>
<p>
	Detour: the ray is deflected and emerges somewhere other than
		where you sent it in.  On the playfield, detours are
		denoted by matching pairs of numbers -- one where the
		ray went in, and the other where it came out.</p>
<p>
	Reflection: the ray is reflected and emerges in the same place
		it was sent in.  On the playfield, reflections are
		denoted by the letter `R'.</p>
<p>
	Hit:	the ray strikes a ball directly and is absorbed.  It does
		not emerge from the box.  On the playfield, hits are
		denoted by the letter `H'.</p>
<p>
The rules for how balls deflect rays are simple and are best shown by
example.</p>
<p>
As a ray approaches a ball it is deflected ninety degrees.  Rays can
be deflected multiple times.  In the diagrams below, the dashes
represent empty box locations and the letter `O' represents a ball.
The entrance and exit points of each ray are marked with numbers as
described under "Detour" above.  Note that the entrance and exit
points are always interchangeable.  `*' denotes the path taken by the
ray.</p>
<p>
Note carefully the relative positions of the ball and the ninety
degree deflection it causes.</p>

<p>
As mentioned above, a reflection occurs when a ray emerges from the same point
it was sent in.  This can happen in several ways:</p>
<p>

  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - O - - -         - - O - O - - -          - - - - - - - -

  - - - - - - - -         - - - - O - - -          - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>
In the first example, the ray is deflected downwards by the upper
ball, then left by the lower ball, and finally retraces its path to
its point of origin.  The second example is similar.  The third
example is a bit anomalous but can be rationalized by realizing the
ray never gets a chance to get into the box.  Alternatively, the ray
can be thought of as being deflected downwards and immediately
emerging from the box.</p>
<p>
A hit occurs when a ray runs straight into a ball:</p>
<p>
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - O - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - O - - -        H * * * * - - - -
  - - - - - - - -       H * * * * O - - -          - - - * - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - O - - -          - - - O - - - -

  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>
Be sure to compare the second example of a hit with the first example of
a reflection.</p>

(fn &optional ARG)<a name="enable-theme"></a>
<h3>Function: enable-theme</h3>
Reenable all variable and face settings defined by THEME.
THEME should be either `user', or a theme loaded via `load-theme'.
After this function completes, THEME will have the highest
precedence (after `user').<a name="comint-stop-subjob"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-stop-subjob</h3>
Stop the current subjob.
This command also kills the pending input
between the process mark and point.</p>
<p>
WARNING: if there is no current subjob, you can end up suspending
the top-level process running in the buffer.  If you accidentally do
this, use M-x comint-continue-subjob to resume the process.  (This
is not a problem with most shells, since they ignore this signal.)</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="word-search-forward-lax"></a>
<h3>Function: word-search-forward-lax</h3>
Search forward from point for STRING, ignoring differences in punctuation.
Set point to the end of the occurrence found, and return point.</p>
<p>
Unlike `word-search-forward', the end of STRING need not match a word
boundary, unless STRING ends in whitespace.</p>
<p>
An optional second argument bounds the search; it is a buffer position.
The match found must not extend after that position.
Optional third argument, if t, means if fail just return nil (no error).
  If not nil and not t, move to limit of search and return nil.
Optional fourth argument is repeat count--search for successive occurrences.</p>
<p>
Relies on the function `word-search-regexp' to convert a sequence
of words in STRING to a regexp used to search words without regard
to punctuation.<a name="ps-extend-face"></a>
<h3>Function: ps-extend-face</h3>
Extend face in ALIST-SYM.</p>
<p>
If optional MERGE-P is non-nil, extensions in FACE-EXTENSION list are merged
with face extensions in ALIST-SYM; otherwise, overrides.</p>

If optional ALIST-SYM is nil, `ps-print-face-extension-alist' is used;
otherwise, it should be an alist symbol.</p>
<p>
The elements of FACE-EXTENSION list have the form:</p>
<p>
   (FACE-NAME FOREGROUND BACKGROUND EXTENSION...)</p>
<p>
FACE-NAME is a face name symbol.</p>
<p>
FOREGROUND and BACKGROUND may be nil or a string that denotes the
foreground and background colors respectively.</p>
<p>
EXTENSION is one of the following symbols:
   bold      - use bold font.
   italic    - use italic font.
   underline - put a line under text.
   strikeout - like underline, but the line is in middle of text.
   overline  - like underline, but the line is over the text.
   shadow    - text will have a shadow.
   box       - text will be surrounded by a box.
   outline   - print characters as hollow outlines.</p>
<p>
If EXTENSION is any other symbol, it is ignored.</p>

<p>
If the font is OpenType font, the form of the list is
  (opentype GSUB GPOS)
where GSUB shows which "GSUB" features the font supports, and GPOS
shows which "GPOS" features the font supports.  Both GSUB and GPOS are
lists of the format:
  ((SCRIPT (LANGSYS FEATURE ...) ...) ...)</p>
<p>
If the font is not OpenType font, currently the length of the form is
one.</p>
<p>
SCRIPT is a symbol representing OpenType script tag.</p>
<p>
LANGSYS is a symbol representing OpenType langsys tag, or nil
representing the default langsys.</p>
<p>
FEATURE is a symbol representing OpenType feature tag.</p>

positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="2C-split"></a>
<h3>Function: 2C-split</h3>
Split a two-column text at point, into two buffers in two-column minor mode.
Point becomes the local value of `2C-window-width'.  Only lines that
have the ARG same preceding characters at that column get split.  The
ARG preceding characters without any leading whitespace become the local
value for `2C-separator'.  This way lines that continue across both
columns remain untouched in the first buffer.</p>
<p>
This function can be used with a prototype line, to set up things.  You
write the first line of each column and then split that line.  E.g.:</p>
<p>
First column's text    sSs  Second column's text
		       \___/\
			/    \
   5 character Separator      You type  M-5 M-x 2C-split  with the point here.</p>

vertical combination.</p>
<p>
(fn WINDOW)<a name="eval-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: eval-buffer</h3>
Execute the current buffer as Lisp code.
When called from a Lisp program (i.e., not interactively), this
function accepts up to five optional arguments:
BUFFER is the buffer to evaluate (nil means use current buffer).
PRINTFLAG controls printing of output:
 A value of nil means discard it; anything else is stream for print.
FILENAME specifies the file name to use for `load-history'.
UNIBYTE, if non-nil, specifies `load-convert-to-unibyte' for this
 invocation.
DO-ALLOW-PRINT, if non-nil, specifies that `print' and related
 functions should work normally even if PRINTFLAG is nil.</p>
<p>
This function preserves the position of point.</p>

<p>

(fn CL-TREE)<a name="ansi-color-apply-sequence"></a>
<h3>Function: ansi-color-apply-sequence</h3>
Apply ESCAPE-SEQ to CODES and return the new list of codes.</p>
<p>
ESCAPE-SEQ is an escape sequence parsed by `ansi-color-parse-sequence'.</p>
<p>
For each new code, the following happens: if it is 1-7, add it to
the list of codes; if it is 21-25 or 27, delete appropriate
parameters from the list of codes; if it is 30-37 resp. 39, the
foreground color code is replaced or added resp. deleted; if it
is 40-47 resp. 49, the background color code is replaced or added
resp. deleted; any other code is discarded together with the old
codes.	Finally, the so changed list of codes is returned.<a name="cl-cadadr"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-cadadr</h3>
Return the `car' of the `cdr' of the `car' of the `cdr' of X.</p>
<p>
(fn X)<a name="image-dired"></a>
<h3>Function: image-dired</h3>
Make a preview buffer for all images in DIR and display it.
If the number of files in DIR matching `image-file-name-regexp'
exceeds `image-dired-show-all-from-dir-max-files', a warning will be
displayed.</p>
<p>
(fn DIR)<a name="widget-plist-member"></a>
<h3>Function: widget-plist-member</h3>
Return non-nil if PLIST has the property PROP.
PLIST is a property list, which is a list of the form
(PROP1 VALUE1 PROP2 VALUE2 ...).  PROP is a symbol.
Unlike `plist-get', this allows you to distinguish between a missing
property and a property with the value nil.
The value is actually the tail of PLIST whose car is PROP.</p>
<p>
(fn PLIST PROP)<a name="call-process-region"></a>
<h3>Function: call-process-region</h3>
Send text from START to END to a synchronous process running PROGRAM.
The remaining arguments are optional.
Delete the text if fourth arg DELETE is non-nil.</p>
<p>
Insert output in BUFFER before point; t means current buffer; nil for
 BUFFER means discard it; 0 means discard and don't wait; and `(:file
 FILE)', where FILE is a file name string, means that it should be
 written to that file (if the file already exists it is overwritten).
BUFFER can also have the form (REAL-BUFFER STDERR-FILE); in that case,
REAL-BUFFER says what to do with standard output, as above,
while STDERR-FILE says what to do with standard error in the child.
STDERR-FILE may be nil (discard standard error output),
t (mix it with ordinary output), or a file name string.</p>
<p>
Sixth arg DISPLAY non-nil means redisplay buffer as output is inserted.
Remaining args are passed to PROGRAM at startup as command args.</p>
<p>
If BUFFER is 0, `call-process-region' returns immediately with value nil.
Otherwise it waits for PROGRAM to terminate
and returns a numeric exit status or a signal description string.
If you quit, the process is killed with SIGINT, or SIGKILL if you quit again.</p>

   VERSION ::= NUMBER ( SEPARATOR NUMBER )*.</p>
<p>
   NUMBER ::= (0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9)+.</p>
<p>
   SEPARATOR ::= `version-separator' (which see)
	       | `version-regexp-alist' (which see).</p>
<p>
The NUMBER part is optional if SEPARATOR is a match for an element
in `version-regexp-alist'.</p>
<p>
Examples of valid version syntax:</p>
<p>
   1.0pre2   1.0.7.5   22.8beta3   0.9alpha1   6.9.30Beta</p>

(fn STRING TABLE PREDICATE POINT MD)<a name="format-seconds"></a>
<h3>Function: format-seconds</h3>
Use format control STRING to format the number SECONDS.
The valid format specifiers are:
%y is the number of (365-day) years.
%d is the number of days.
%h is the number of hours.
%m is the number of minutes.
%s is the number of seconds.
%z is a non-printing control flag (see below).
%% is a literal "%".</p>

Upper-case specifiers are followed by the unit-name (e.g. "years").
Lower-case specifiers return only the unit.</p>
<p>
"%" may be followed by a number specifying a width, with an
optional leading "." for zero-padding.  For example, "%.3Y" will
return something of the form "001 year".</p>
<p>
The "%z" specifier does not print anything.  When it is used, specifiers
must be given in order of decreasing size.  To the left of "%z", nothing
is output until the first non-zero unit is encountered.</p>

<h3>Function: last-sexp-toggle-display</h3>
Toggle between abbreviated and unabbreviated printed representations.<a name="rmail-output"></a>
<h3>Function: rmail-output</h3>
Append this message to mail file FILE-NAME.
Writes mbox format, unless FILE-NAME exists and is Babyl format, in which
case it writes Babyl.</p>
<p>
Interactively, the default file name comes from `rmail-default-file',
which is updated to the name you use in this command.  In all uses, if
FILE-NAME is not absolute, it is expanded with the directory part of
`rmail-default-file'.</p>
<p>
If a buffer is visiting FILE-NAME, adds the text to that buffer
rather than saving the file directly.  If the buffer is an Rmail
buffer, updates it accordingly.</p>
<p>
This command always outputs the complete message header, even if
the header display is currently pruned.</p>
<p>
Optional prefix argument COUNT (default 1) says to output that
many consecutive messages, starting with the current one (ignoring
deleted messages).  If `rmail-delete-after-output' is non-nil, deletes
messages after output.</p>
<p>
The optional third argument NOATTRIBUTE, if non-nil, says not to
set the `filed' attribute, and not to display a "Wrote file"
message (if writing a file directly).</p>
<p>
Set the optional fourth argument NOT-RMAIL non-nil if you call this
from a non-Rmail buffer.  In this case, COUNT is ignored.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE-NAME &optional COUNT NOATTRIBUTE NOT-RMAIL)<a name="y-or-n-p"></a>
<h3>Function: y-or-n-p</h3>
Ask user a "y or n" question.  Return t if answer is "y".
PROMPT is the string to display to ask the question.  It should
end in a space; `y-or-n-p' adds "(y or n) " to it.</p>
<p>
No confirmation of the answer is requested; a single character is
enough.  SPC also means yes, and DEL means no.</p>
<p>
To be precise, this function translates user input into responses
by consulting the bindings in `query-replace-map'; see the
documentation of that variable for more information.  In this
case, the useful bindings are `act', `skip', `recenter',
`scroll-up', `scroll-down', and `quit'.
An `act' response means yes, and a `skip' response means no.
A `quit' response means to invoke `keyboard-quit'.
If the user enters `recenter', `scroll-up', or `scroll-down'
responses, perform the requested window recentering or scrolling
and ask again.</p>
<p>
Under a windowing system a dialog box will be used if `last-nonmenu-event'
is nil and `use-dialog-box' is non-nil.<a name="tooltip-event-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: tooltip-event-buffer</h3>
Return the buffer over which event EVENT occurred.
This might return nil if the event did not occur over a buffer.<a name="mh-send-letter"></a>
<h3>Function: mh-send-letter</h3>
Save draft and send message.</p>
<p>
When you are all through editing a message, you send it with this
command. You can give a prefix argument ARG to monitor the first stage
of the delivery; this output can be found in a buffer called "*MH-E
Mail Delivery*".</p>
<p>
The hook `mh-before-send-letter-hook' is run at the beginning of
this command. For example, if you want to check your spelling in
your message before sending, add the function `ispell-message'.</p>
<p>
Unless `mh-insert-auto-fields' had previously been called
manually, the function `mh-insert-auto-fields' is called to
insert fields based upon the recipients. If fields are added, you
are given a chance to see and to confirm these fields before the
message is actually sent. You can do away with this confirmation
by turning off the option `mh-auto-fields-prompt-flag'.</p>
<p>
In case the MH "send" program is installed under a different name,
use `mh-send-prog' to tell MH-E the name.</p>
<p>
The hook `mh-annotate-msg-hook' is run after annotating the
message and scan line.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="x-display-screens"></a>
<h3>Function: x-display-screens</h3>
Return the number of screens on the X server of display TERMINAL.
The optional argument TERMINAL specifies which display to ask about.
TERMINAL should be a terminal object, a frame or a display name (a string).
If omitted or nil, that stands for the selected frame's display.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional TERMINAL)<a name="auth-source-backend-child-p"></a>
<h3>Function: auth-source-backend-child-p</h3>
Test OBJ to see if it an object is a child of type auth-source-backend<a name="font-show-log"></a>
<h3>Function: font-show-log</h3>
Show log of font listing and opening.
Prefix arg LIMIT says how many fonts to show for each listing.
The default is 20.  If LIMIT is negative, do not limit the listing.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional LIMIT)<a name="define-button-type"></a>
<h3>Function: define-button-type</h3>
Define a `button type' called NAME (a symbol).
The remaining arguments form a sequence of PROPERTY VALUE pairs,
specifying properties to use as defaults for buttons with this type
(a button's type may be set by giving it a `type' property when
creating the button, using the :type keyword argument).</p>
<p>
In addition, the keyword argument :supertype may be used to specify a
button-type from which NAME inherits its default property values
(however, the inheritance happens only when NAME is defined; subsequent
changes to a supertype are not reflected in its subtypes).<a name="x-parse-geometry"></a>
<h3>Function: x-parse-geometry</h3>
Parse a display geometry string STRING.
Returns an alist of the form ((top . TOP), (left . LEFT) ... ).
The properties returned may include `top', `left', `height', and `width'.
For X, the value of `left' or `top' may be an integer,
or a list (+ N) meaning N pixels relative to top/left corner,
or a list (- N) meaning -N pixels relative to bottom/right corner.
On Nextstep, this just calls `ns-parse-geometry'.</p>
<p>
(fn STRING)<a name="pcomplete-completions"></a>
<h3>Function: pcomplete-completions</h3>
Return a list of completions for the current argument position.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="set-border-color"></a>
<h3>Function: set-border-color</h3>
Set the color of the border of the selected frame to COLOR-NAME.
When called interactively, prompt for the name of the color to use.
To get the frame's current border color, use `frame-parameters'.<a name="browse-url-netscape"></a>
<h3>Function: browse-url-netscape</h3>
Ask the Netscape WWW browser to load URL.
Default to the URL around or before point.  The strings in variable
`browse-url-netscape-arguments' are also passed to Netscape.</p>
<p>
When called interactively, if variable `browse-url-new-window-flag' is
non-nil, load the document in a new Netscape window, otherwise use a
random existing one.  A non-nil interactive prefix argument reverses
the effect of `browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
If `browse-url-netscape-new-window-is-tab' is non-nil, then
whenever a document would otherwise be loaded in a new window, it
is loaded in a new tab in an existing window instead.</p>
<p>
When called non-interactively, optional second argument NEW-WINDOW is
used instead of `browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
(fn URL &optional NEW-WINDOW)<a name="face-name"></a>
<h3>Function: face-name</h3>
Return the name of face FACE.<a name="shell-quote-wildcard-pattern"></a>
<h3>Function: shell-quote-wildcard-pattern</h3>
Quote characters special to the shell in PATTERN, leave wildcards alone.</p>
<p>
PATTERN is assumed to represent a file-name wildcard suitable for the
underlying filesystem.  For Unix and GNU/Linux, each character from the
set [ \t\n;<>&|()'"#$] is quoted with a backslash; for DOS/Windows, all
the parts of the pattern which don't include wildcard characters are
quoted with double quotes.</p>
<p>
This function leaves alone existing quote characters (\ on Unix and "
on Windows), so PATTERN can use them to quote wildcard characters that
need to be passed verbatim to shell commands.<a name="wholenump"></a>
<h3>Function: wholenump</h3>
Return t if OBJECT is a nonnegative integer.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT)<a name="ewoc-enter-before"></a>
<h3>Function: ewoc-enter-before</h3>
Enter a new element DATA before NODE in EWOC.
Return the new node.</p>
<p>
(fn EWOC NODE DATA)<a name="tooltip-help-tips"></a>
<h3>Function: tooltip-help-tips</h3>
Hook function to display a help tooltip.
This is installed on the hook `tooltip-functions', which
is run when the timer with id `tooltip-timeout-id' fires.
Value is non-nil if this function handled the tip.<a name="tramp-completion-handle-file-name-completion"></a>
<h3>Function: tramp-completion-handle-file-name-completion</h3>
Like `file-name-completion' for Tramp files.</p>
<p>
(fn FILENAME DIRECTORY &optional PREDICATE)<a name="charset-info"></a>
<h3>Function: charset-info</h3>
Return a vector of information of CHARSET.
This function is provided for backward compatibility.</p>
<p>
The elements of the vector are:
	CHARSET-ID, BYTES, DIMENSION, CHARS, WIDTH, DIRECTION,
	LEADING-CODE-BASE, LEADING-CODE-EXT,
	ISO-FINAL-CHAR, ISO-GRAPHIC-PLANE,
	REVERSE-CHARSET, SHORT-NAME, LONG-NAME,	DESCRIPTION,
	PLIST.
where
CHARSET-ID is always 0.
BYTES is always 0.
DIMENSION is the number of bytes of a code-point of the charset:
  1, 2, 3, or 4.
CHARS is the number of characters in a dimension:
  94, 96, 128, or 256.
WIDTH is always 0.
DIRECTION is always 0.
LEADING-CODE-BASE is always 0.
LEADING-CODE-EXT is always 0.
ISO-FINAL-CHAR (character) is the final character of the
  corresponding ISO 2022 charset.  If the charset is not assigned
  any final character, the value is -1.
ISO-GRAPHIC-PLANE is always 0.
REVERSE-CHARSET is always -1.
SHORT-NAME (string) is the short name to refer to the charset.
LONG-NAME (string) is the long name to refer to the charset
DESCRIPTION (string) is the description string of the charset.
PLIST (property list) may contain any type of information a user
  want to put and get by functions `put-charset-property' and
  `get-charset-property' respectively.<a name="gnus-or"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-or</h3>
Return non-nil if any of the elements are non-nil.<a name="kmacro-edit-macro-repeat"></a>
<h3>Function: kmacro-edit-macro-repeat</h3>
Edit last keyboard macro.<a name="scroll-bar-scroll-down"></a>
<h3>Function: scroll-bar-scroll-down</h3>
Scroll the window's top line down to the location of the scroll bar click.
EVENT should be a scroll bar click.<a name="dnd-open-local-file"></a>
<h3>Function: dnd-open-local-file</h3>
Open a local file.
The file is opened in the current window, or a new window if
`dnd-open-file-other-window' is set.  URI is the url for the file,
and must have the format file:file-name or file:///file-name.
The last / in file:/// is part of the file name.  If the system
natively supports unc file names, then remote urls of the form
file://server-name/file-name will also be handled by this function.
An alternative for systems that do not support unc file names is
`dnd-open-remote-url'. ACTION is ignored.<a name="javascript-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: javascript-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing JavaScript.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="html-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: html-mode</h3>
Major mode based on SGML mode for editing HTML documents.
This allows inserting skeleton constructs used in hypertext documents with
completion.  See below for an introduction to HTML.  Use
C-c C-v to see how this comes out.  See also `sgml-mode' on
which this is based.</p>
<p>
Do C-h v html- SPC and C-h v sgml- SPC to see available variables.</p>
<p>
To write fairly well formatted pages you only need to know few things.  Most
browsers have a function to read the source code of the page being seen, so
you can imitate various tricks.  Here's a very short HTML primer which you
can also view with a browser to see what happens:</p>
<p>
<title>A Title Describing Contents</title> should be on every page.  Pages can
have <h1>Very Major Headlines</h1> through <h6>Very Minor Headlines</h6>
<hr> Parts can be separated with horizontal rules.</p>
<p>
<p>Paragraphs only need an opening tag.  Line breaks and multiple spaces are
ignored unless the text is <pre>preformatted.</pre>  Text can be marked as
<b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i> or <u>underlined</u> using the normal M-o or
Edit/Text Properties/Face commands.</p>
<p>
Pages can have <a name="SOMENAME">named points</a> and can link other points
to them with <a href="#SOMENAME">see also somename</a>.  In the same way <a
href="URL">see also URL</a> where URL is a filename relative to current
directory, or absolute as in `http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html'.</p>
<p>
Images in many formats can be inlined with <img src="URL">.</p>
<p>
If you mainly create your own documents, `sgml-specials' might be
interesting.  But note that some HTML 2 browsers can't handle `&apos;'.
To work around that, do:
   (eval-after-load "sgml-mode" '(aset sgml-char-names ?' nil))</p>

Generated from `ispell-tex-skip-alists'.<a name="mouse-split-window-horizontally"></a>
<h3>Function: mouse-split-window-horizontally</h3>
Select Emacs window mouse is on, then split it horizontally in half.
The window is split at the column clicked on.
This command must be bound to a mouse click.</p>
<p>
(fn CLICK)<a name="telnet"></a>
<h3>Function: telnet</h3>
Open a network login connection to host named HOST (a string).
Optional arg PORT specifies alternative port to connect to.
Interactively, use C-u prefix to be prompted for port number.</p>
<p>
Communication with HOST is recorded in a buffer `*PROGRAM-HOST*'
where PROGRAM is the telnet program being used.  This program
is controlled by the contents of the global variable `telnet-host-properties',
falling back on the value of the global variable `telnet-program'.
Normally input is edited in Emacs and sent a line at a time.</p>
<p>
(fn HOST &optional PORT)<a name="pp-eval-expression"></a>
<h3>Function: pp-eval-expression</h3>
Evaluate EXPRESSION and pretty-print its value.
Also add the value to the front of the list in the variable `values'.<a name="glyph-face"></a>
<h3>Function: glyph-face</h3>
Return the face of glyph code GLYPH, or nil if glyph has default face.<a name="apropos"></a>
<h3>Function: apropos</h3>
Show all meaningful Lisp symbols whose names match PATTERN.
Symbols are shown if they are defined as functions, variables, or
faces, or if they have nonempty property lists.</p>
<p>
PATTERN can be a word, a list of words (separated by spaces),
or a regexp (using some regexp special characters).  If it is a word,
search for matches for that word as a substring.  If it is a list of words,
search for matches for any two (or more) of those words.</p>
<p>
With C-u prefix, or if `apropos-do-all' is non-nil,
consider all symbols (if they match PATTERN).</p>
<p>
Returns list of symbols and documentation found.<a name="bidi-string-mark-left-to-right"></a>
<h3>Function: bidi-string-mark-left-to-right</h3>
Return a string that can be safely inserted in left-to-right text.</p>
<p>
Normally, inserting a string with right-to-left (RTL) script into
a buffer may cause some subsequent text to be displayed as part
of the RTL segment (usually this affects punctuation characters).
This function returns a string which displays as STR but forces
subsequent text to be displayed as left-to-right.</p>
<p>
If STR contains any RTL character, this function returns a string
consisting of STR followed by an invisible left-to-right mark
(LRM) character.  Otherwise, it returns STR.<a name="custom-post-filter-face-spec"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-post-filter-face-spec</h3>
Return the customized SPEC in a form suitable for setting the face.<a name="sentence-at-point"></a>

Display LIST where list may contain objects.<a name="sort-coding-systems"></a>
<h3>Function: sort-coding-systems</h3>
Sort coding system list CODINGS by a priority of each coding system.
Return the sorted list.  CODINGS is modified by side effects.</p>
<p>
If a coding system is most preferred, it has the highest priority.
Otherwise, coding systems that correspond to MIME charsets have
higher priorities.  Among them, a coding system included in the
`coding-system' key of the current language environment has higher
priority.  See also the documentation of `language-info-alist'.</p>
<p>
If the variable `sort-coding-systems-predicate' (which see) is
non-nil, it is used to sort CODINGS instead.<a name="minibuffer-insert-file-name-at-point"></a>

Return the resulting coding system.<a name="indirect-variable"></a>
<h3>Function: indirect-variable</h3>
Return the variable at the end of OBJECT's variable chain.
If OBJECT is a symbol, follow its variable indirections (if any), and
return the variable at the end of the chain of aliases.  See Info node
`(elisp)Variable Aliases'.</p>
<p>
If OBJECT is not a symbol, just return it.  If there is a loop in the
chain of aliases, signal a `cyclic-variable-indirection' error.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT)<a name="widget-convert-button"></a>
<h3>Function: widget-convert-button</h3>
Return a widget of type TYPE with endpoint FROM TO.
Optional ARGS are extra keyword arguments for TYPE.
No text will be inserted to the buffer, instead the text between FROM
and TO will be used as the widgets end points, as well as the widgets
button end points.</p>
<p>

change the existing association.  Value is the resulting alist.<a name="raise-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: raise-frame</h3>
Bring FRAME to the front, so it occludes any frames it overlaps.
If FRAME is invisible or iconified, make it visible.
If you don't specify a frame, the selected frame is used.
If Emacs is displaying on an ordinary terminal or some other device which
doesn't support multiple overlapping frames, this function selects FRAME.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FRAME)<a name="frame-live-p"></a>
<h3>Function: frame-live-p</h3>
Return non-nil if OBJECT is a frame which has not been deleted.
Value is nil if OBJECT is not a live frame.  If object is a live

Switch to *dungeon* buffer and start game.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="add-minor-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: add-minor-mode</h3>
Register a new minor mode.</p>
<p>
This is an XEmacs-compatibility function.  Use `define-minor-mode' instead.</p>
<p>
TOGGLE is a symbol which is the name of a buffer-local variable that
is toggled on or off to say whether the minor mode is active or not.</p>
<p>
NAME specifies what will appear in the mode line when the minor mode
is active.  NAME should be either a string starting with a space, or a
symbol whose value is such a string.</p>
<p>
Optional KEYMAP is the keymap for the minor mode that will be added
to `minor-mode-map-alist'.</p>
<p>
Optional AFTER specifies that TOGGLE should be added after AFTER
in `minor-mode-alist'.</p>
<p>
Optional TOGGLE-FUN is an interactive function to toggle the mode.
It defaults to (and should by convention be) TOGGLE.</p>
<p>
If TOGGLE has a non-nil `:included' property, an entry for the mode is
included in the mode-line minor mode menu.
If TOGGLE has a `:menu-tag', that is used for the menu item's label.<a name="byte-compile-insert"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-compile-insert</h3></p>
<p>

(fn FORM)<a name="isearch-other-control-char"></a>
<h3>Function: isearch-other-control-char</h3>
Process a miscellaneous key sequence in Isearch mode.</p>
<p>
Try to convert the current key-sequence to something usable in Isearch
mode, either by converting it with `function-key-map', downcasing a
key with C-<upper case>, or finding a "scrolling command" bound to
it.  (In the last case, we may have to read more events.)  If so,
either unread the converted sequence or execute the command.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, if `search-exit-option' is non-nil (the default) unread the
key-sequence and exit the search normally.  If it is the symbol
`edit', the search string is edited in the minibuffer and the meta
character is unread so that it applies to editing the string.</p>
<p>
ARG is the prefix argument.  It will be transmitted through to the
scrolling command or to the command whose key-sequence exits
Isearch mode.<a name="select-frame-by-name"></a>
<h3>Function: select-frame-by-name</h3>
Select the frame on the current terminal whose name is NAME and raise it.
If there is no frame by that name, signal an error.<a name="translate-region"></a>
<h3>Function: translate-region</h3>
From START to END, translate characters according to TABLE.
TABLE is a string or a char-table.
If TABLE is a string, the Nth character in it is the mapping
for the character with code N.
If TABLE is a char-table, the element for character N is the mapping
for the character with code N.
It returns the number of characters changed.<a name="lm-insert-at-column"></a>
<h3>Function: lm-insert-at-column</h3>
Insert, at column COL, list of STRINGS.<a name="debugger-frame-clear"></a>
<h3>Function: debugger-frame-clear</h3>
Do not enter debugger when this frame exits.
Applies to the frame whose line point is on in the backtrace.<a name="eudc-expand-inline"></a>
<h3>Function: eudc-expand-inline</h3>
Query the directory server, and expand the query string before point.
The query string consists of the buffer substring from the point back to
the preceding comma, colon or beginning of line.
The variable `eudc-inline-query-format' controls how to associate the
individual inline query words with directory attribute names.
After querying the server for the given string, the expansion specified by
`eudc-inline-expansion-format' is inserted in the buffer at point.
If REPLACE is non-nil, then this expansion replaces the name in the buffer.
`eudc-expansion-overwrites-query' being non-nil inverts the meaning of REPLACE.
Multiple servers can be tried with the same query until one finds a match,

<p>
(fn X)<a name="font-lock-add-keywords"></a>
<h3>Function: font-lock-add-keywords</h3>
Add highlighting KEYWORDS for MODE.</p>
<p>
MODE should be a symbol, the major mode command name, such as `c-mode'
or nil.  If nil, highlighting keywords are added for the current buffer.
KEYWORDS should be a list; see the variable `font-lock-keywords'.
By default they are added at the beginning of the current highlighting list.
If optional argument HOW is `set', they are used to replace the current
highlighting list.  If HOW is any other non-nil value, they are added at the
end of the current highlighting list.</p>
<p>
For example:</p>
<p>
 (font-lock-add-keywords 'c-mode
  '(("\\<\\(FIXME\\):" 1 'font-lock-warning-face prepend)
    ("\\<\\(and\\|or\\|not\\)\\>" . 'font-lock-keyword-face)))</p>
<p>
adds two fontification patterns for C mode, to fontify `FIXME:' words, even in
comments, and to fontify `and', `or' and `not' words as keywords.</p>
<p>
The above procedure will only add the keywords for C mode, not
for modes derived from C mode.  To add them for derived modes too,
pass nil for MODE and add the call to c-mode-hook.</p>
<p>
For example:</p>
<p>
 (add-hook 'c-mode-hook
  (lambda ()
   (font-lock-add-keywords nil
    '(("\\<\\(FIXME\\):" 1 'font-lock-warning-face prepend)
      ("\\<\\(and\\|or\\|not\\)\\>" .
       'font-lock-keyword-face)))))</p>
<p>
The above procedure may fail to add keywords to derived modes if
some involved major mode does not follow the standard conventions.
File a bug report if this happens, so the major mode can be corrected.</p>
<p>
Note that some modes have specialized support for additional patterns, e.g.,
see the variables `c-font-lock-extra-types', `c++-font-lock-extra-types',
`objc-font-lock-extra-types' and `java-font-lock-extra-types'.<a name="choose-completion-string"></a>

<p>

Uses keymap `allout-mode-map-value', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
Allout outline mode is a minor mode that provides extensive
outline oriented formatting and manipulation.  It enables
structural editing of outlines, as well as navigation and
exposure.  It also is specifically aimed at accommodating
syntax-sensitive text like programming languages.  (For example,
see the allout code itself, which is organized as an allout
outline.)</p>
<p>
In addition to typical outline navigation and exposure, allout includes:</p>
<p>
 - topic-oriented authoring, including keystroke-based topic creation,
   repositioning, promotion/demotion, cut, and paste
 - incremental search with dynamic exposure and reconcealment of hidden text
 - adjustable format, so programming code can be developed in outline-structure
 - easy topic encryption and decryption, symmetric or key-pair
 - "Hot-spot" operation, for single-keystroke maneuvering and exposure control
 - integral outline layout, for automatic initial exposure when visiting a file
 - independent extensibility, using comprehensive exposure and authoring hooks</p>
<p>
and many other features.</p>
<p>
Below is a description of the key bindings, and then description
of special `allout-mode' features and terminology.  See also the
outline menubar additions for quick reference to many of the
features.  Customize `allout-auto-activation' to prepare your
Emacs session for automatic activation of `allout-mode'.</p>
<p>
The bindings are those listed in `allout-prefixed-keybindings'
and `allout-unprefixed-keybindings'.  We recommend customizing
`allout-command-prefix' to use just `\C-c' as the command
prefix, if the allout bindings don't conflict with any personal
bindings you have on \C-c.  In any case, outline structure
navigation and authoring is simplified by positioning the cursor
on an item's bullet character, the "hot-spot" -- then you can
invoke allout commands with just the un-prefixed,
un-control-shifted command letters.  This is described further in
the HOT-SPOT Operation section.</p>
<p>
        Exposure Control:
        ----------------
M-x allout-hide-current-subtree   `allout-hide-current-subtree'
M-x allout-show-children `allout-show-children'
M-x allout-show-current-subtree `allout-show-current-subtree'
M-x allout-show-current-entry `allout-show-current-entry'
M-x allout-show-all   `allout-show-all'</p>
<p>

M-x allout-beginning-of-current-entry `allout-beginning-of-current-entry' (alternately, goes to hot-spot)
M-x allout-beginning-of-line  `allout-beginning-of-line' -- like regular beginning-of-line, but
     if immediately repeated cycles to the beginning of the current item
     and then to the hot-spot (if `allout-beginning-of-line-cycles' is set).</p>
<p>

M-x allout-open-supertopic `allout-open-supertopic' ... a sibling of the current topic's parent.</p>
<p>
        Topic Level and Prefix Adjustment:
        ---------------------------------
M-x allout-shift-in `allout-shift-in'   Shift current topic and all offspring deeper
M-x allout-shift-out `allout-shift-out' ... less deep
M-x allout-rebullet-current-heading `allout-rebullet-current-heading' Prompt for alternate bullet for
            current topic
M-x allout-rebullet-topic `allout-rebullet-topic'   Reconcile bullets of topic and
            its offspring -- distinctive bullets are not changed, others
            are alternated according to nesting depth.
M-x allout-number-siblings `allout-number-siblings'  Number bullets of topic and siblings --
           the offspring are not affected.
           With repeat count, revoke numbering.</p>
<p>
        Topic-oriented Killing and Yanking:
        ----------------------------------
M-x allout-kill-topic `allout-kill-topic'   Kill current topic, including offspring.
M-x allout-copy-topic-as-kill `allout-copy-topic-as-kill' Copy current topic, including offspring.
M-x allout-kill-line     `allout-kill-line'    Kill line, attending to outline structure.
M-x allout-copy-line-as-kill     `allout-copy-line-as-kill' Copy line but don't delete it.
M-x allout-yank `allout-yank'        Yank, adjusting depth of yanked topic to
                             depth of heading if yanking into bare topic
                             heading (ie, prefix sans text).
M-x allout-yank-pop     `allout-yank-pop'       Is to `allout-yank' as `yank-pop' is to `yank'.</p>
<p>
        Topic-oriented Encryption:
        -------------------------
M-x allout-toggle-current-subtree-encryption `allout-toggle-current-subtree-encryption'
          Encrypt/Decrypt topic content</p>
<p>
        Misc commands:
        -------------
M-x outlineify-sticky       Activate outline mode for current buffer,
                            and establish a default file-var setting
                            for `allout-layout'.

                            prefixes to section.subsection... numeric
                            format.
M-x customize-variable allout-auto-activation
                            Prepare Emacs session for allout outline mode
                            auto-activation.</p>
<p>
                  Topic Encryption</p>
<p>
Outline mode supports gpg encryption of topics, with support for
symmetric and key-pair modes, and auto-encryption of topics
pending encryption on save.</p>
<p>
Topics pending encryption are, by default, automatically
encrypted during file saves, including checkpoint saves, to avoid
exposing the plain text of encrypted topics in the file system.
If the content of the topic containing the cursor was encrypted
for a save, it is automatically decrypted for continued editing.</p>
<p>
NOTE: A few GnuPG v2 versions improperly preserve incorrect
symmetric decryption keys, preventing entry of the correct key on
subsequent decryption attempts until the cache times-out.  That
can take several minutes.  (Decryption of other entries is not
affected.)  Upgrade your EasyPG version, if you can, and you can
deliberately clear your gpg-agent's cache by sending it a '-HUP'
signal.</p>
<p>
See `allout-toggle-current-subtree-encryption' function docstring
and `allout-encrypt-unencrypted-on-saves' customization variable
for details.</p>
<p>
                 HOT-SPOT Operation</p>
<p>
Hot-spot operation provides a means for easy, single-keystroke outline
navigation and exposure control.</p>
<p>
When the text cursor is positioned directly on the bullet character of
a topic, regular characters (a to z) invoke the commands of the
corresponding allout-mode keymap control chars.  For example, "f"
would invoke the command typically bound to "C-c<space>C-f"
(M-x allout-forward-current-level `allout-forward-current-level').</p>
<p>
Thus, by positioning the cursor on a topic bullet, you can
execute the outline navigation and manipulation commands with a
single keystroke.  Regular navigation keys (eg, C-f, C-n) don't get
this special translation, so you can use them to get out of the
hot-spot and back to normal editing operation.</p>
<p>
In allout-mode, the normal beginning-of-line command (M-x allout-beginning-of-line) is
replaced with one that makes it easy to get to the hot-spot.  If you
repeat it immediately it cycles (if `allout-beginning-of-line-cycles'
is set) to the beginning of the item and then, if you hit it again
immediately, to the hot-spot.  Similarly, `allout-beginning-of-current-entry'
(M-x allout-beginning-of-current-entry) moves to the hot-spot when the cursor is already located
at the beginning of the current entry.</p>
<p>
                             Extending Allout</p>
<p>
Allout exposure and authoring activities all have associated
hooks, by which independent code can cooperate with allout
without changes to the allout core.  Here are key ones:</p>
<p>
`allout-mode-hook'
`allout-mode-deactivate-hook' (deprecated)
`allout-mode-off-hook'
`allout-exposure-change-functions'
`allout-structure-added-functions'
`allout-structure-deleted-functions'
`allout-structure-shifted-functions'
`allout-after-copy-or-kill-hook'
`allout-post-undo-hook'</p>
<p>
                            Terminology</p>
<p>
Topic hierarchy constituents -- TOPICS and SUBTOPICS:</p>
<p>
ITEM:   A unitary outline element, including the HEADER and ENTRY text.
TOPIC:  An ITEM and any ITEMs contained within it, ie having greater DEPTH
        and with no intervening items of lower DEPTH than the container.
CURRENT ITEM:
        The visible ITEM most immediately containing the cursor.
DEPTH:  The degree of nesting of an ITEM; it increases with containment.
        The DEPTH is determined by the HEADER PREFIX.  The DEPTH is also
        called the:
LEVEL:  The same as DEPTH.</p>
<p>
ANCESTORS:
        Those ITEMs whose TOPICs contain an ITEM.
PARENT: An ITEM's immediate ANCESTOR.  It has a DEPTH one less than that
        of the ITEM.
OFFSPRING:
        The ITEMs contained within an ITEM's TOPIC.
SUBTOPIC:
        An OFFSPRING of its ANCESTOR TOPICs.
CHILD:
        An immediate SUBTOPIC of its PARENT.
SIBLINGS:
        TOPICs having the same PARENT and DEPTH.</p>
<p>
Topic text constituents:</p>
<p>
HEADER: The first line of an ITEM, include the ITEM PREFIX and HEADER
        text.
ENTRY:  The text content of an ITEM, before any OFFSPRING, but including
        the HEADER text and distinct from the ITEM PREFIX.
BODY:   Same as ENTRY.
PREFIX: The leading text of an ITEM which distinguishes it from normal
        ENTRY text.  Allout recognizes the outline structure according
        to the strict PREFIX format.  It consists of a PREFIX-LEAD string,
        PREFIX-PADDING, and a BULLET.  The BULLET might be followed by a
        number, indicating the ordinal number of the topic among its
        siblings, or an asterisk indicating encryption, plus an optional
        space.  After that is the ITEM HEADER text, which is not part of
        the PREFIX.</p>
<p>
        The relative length of the PREFIX determines the nesting DEPTH
        of the ITEM.
PREFIX-LEAD:
        The string at the beginning of a HEADER PREFIX, by default a `.'.
        It can be customized by changing the setting of
        `allout-header-prefix' and then reinitializing `allout-mode'.</p>
<p>
        When the PREFIX-LEAD is set to the comment-string of a
        programming language, outline structuring can be embedded in
        program code without interfering with processing of the text
        (by Emacs or the language processor) as program code.  This
        setting happens automatically when allout mode is used in
        programming-mode buffers.  See `allout-use-mode-specific-leader'
        docstring for more detail.
PREFIX-PADDING:
        Spaces or asterisks which separate the PREFIX-LEAD and the
        bullet, determining the ITEM's DEPTH.
BULLET: A character at the end of the ITEM PREFIX, it must be one of
        the characters listed on `allout-plain-bullets-string' or
        `allout-distinctive-bullets-string'.  When creating a TOPIC,
        plain BULLETs are by default used, according to the DEPTH of the
        TOPIC.  Choice among the distinctive BULLETs is offered when you
        provide a universal argument (C-u) to the
        TOPIC creation command, or when explicitly rebulleting a TOPIC.  The
        significance of the various distinctive bullets is purely by
        convention.  See the documentation for the above bullet strings for
        more details.
EXPOSURE:
        The state of a TOPIC which determines the on-screen visibility
        of its OFFSPRING and contained ENTRY text.
CONCEALED:
        TOPICs and ENTRY text whose EXPOSURE is inhibited.  Concealed
        text is represented by "..." ellipses.</p>
<p>
        CONCEALED TOPICs are effectively collapsed within an ANCESTOR.
CLOSED: A TOPIC whose immediate OFFSPRING and body-text is CONCEALED.
OPEN:	A TOPIC that is not CLOSED, though its OFFSPRING or BODY may be.</p>

(fn &optional TO SUBJECT OTHER-HEADERS &rest IGNORED)<a name="normal-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: normal-mode</h3>
Choose the major mode for this buffer automatically.
Also sets up any specified local variables of the file.
Uses the visited file name, the -*- line, and the local variables spec.</p>
<p>
This function is called automatically from `find-file'.  In that case,
we may set up the file-specified mode and local variables,
depending on the value of `enable-local-variables'.
In addition, if `local-enable-local-variables' is nil, we do
not set local variables (though we do notice a mode specified with -*-.)</p>
<p>
`enable-local-variables' is ignored if you run `normal-mode' interactively,
or from Lisp without specifying the optional argument FIND-FILE;
in that case, this function acts as if `enable-local-variables' were t.<a name="set-fringe-bitmap-face"></a>
<h3>Function: set-fringe-bitmap-face</h3>

<h3>Function: button-type-subtype-p</h3>
Return t if button-type TYPE is a subtype of SUPERTYPE.<a name="hide-ifdef-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: hide-ifdef-mode</h3>
Toggle features to hide/show #ifdef blocks (Hide-Ifdef mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Hide-Ifdef mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Hide-Ifdef mode is a buffer-local minor mode for use with C and
C-like major modes.  When enabled, code within #ifdef constructs
that the C preprocessor would eliminate may be hidden from view.
Several variables affect how the hiding is done:</p>
<p>
`hide-ifdef-env'
	An association list of defined and undefined symbols for the
	current buffer.  Initially, the global value of `hide-ifdef-env'
	is used.</p>
<p>
`hide-ifdef-define-alist'
	An association list of defined symbol lists.
        Use `hide-ifdef-set-define-alist' to save the current `hide-ifdef-env'
        and `hide-ifdef-use-define-alist' to set the current `hide-ifdef-env'
        from one of the lists in `hide-ifdef-define-alist'.</p>
<p>
`hide-ifdef-lines'
	Set to non-nil to not show #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, and
	#endif lines when hiding.</p>
<p>
`hide-ifdef-initially'
	Indicates whether `hide-ifdefs' should be called when Hide-Ifdef mode
	is activated.</p>
<p>
`hide-ifdef-read-only'
	Set to non-nil if you want to make buffers read only while hiding.
	After `show-ifdefs', read-only status is restored to previous value.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `hide-ifdef-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

<p>
(fn PROCESS START END)<a name="set-fontset-font"></a>
<h3>Function: set-fontset-font</h3>
Modify fontset NAME to use FONT-SPEC for TARGET characters.</p>
<p>
NAME is a fontset name string, nil for the fontset of FRAME, or t for
the default fontset.</p>
<p>
TARGET may be a cons; (FROM . TO), where FROM and TO are characters.
In that case, use FONT-SPEC for all characters in the range FROM and
TO (inclusive).</p>
<p>
TARGET may be a script name symbol.  In that case, use FONT-SPEC for
all characters that belong to the script.</p>
<p>
TARGET may be a charset.  In that case, use FONT-SPEC for all
characters in the charset.</p>
<p>
TARGET may be nil.  In that case, use FONT-SPEC for any characters for
that no FONT-SPEC is specified.</p>
<p>
FONT-SPEC may one of these:
 * A font-spec object made by the function `font-spec' (which see).
 * A cons (FAMILY . REGISTRY), where FAMILY is a font family name and
   REGISTRY is a font registry name.  FAMILY may contain foundry
   name, and REGISTRY may contain encoding name.
 * A font name string.
 * nil, which explicitly specifies that there's no font for TARGET.</p>
<p>
Optional 4th argument FRAME is a frame or nil for the selected frame
that is concerned in the case that NAME is nil.</p>
<p>
Optional 5th argument ADD, if non-nil, specifies how to add FONT-SPEC
to the font specifications for TARGET previously set.  If it is
`prepend', FONT-SPEC is prepended.  If it is `append', FONT-SPEC is
appended.  By default, FONT-SPEC overrides the previous settings.</p>

<p>
(fn)<a name="quit-restore-window"></a>
<h3>Function: quit-restore-window</h3>
Quit WINDOW and deal with its buffer.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
According to information stored in WINDOW's `quit-restore' window
parameter either (1) delete WINDOW and its frame, (2) delete
WINDOW, (3) restore the buffer previously displayed in WINDOW,
or (4) make WINDOW display some other buffer than the present
one.  If non-nil, reset `quit-restore' parameter to nil.</p>
<p>
Optional second argument BURY-OR-KILL tells how to proceed with
the buffer of WINDOW.  The following values are handled:</p>
<p>
`nil' means to not handle the buffer in a particular way.  This
  means that if WINDOW is not deleted by this function, invoking
  `switch-to-prev-buffer' will usually show the buffer again.</p>
<p>
`append' means that if WINDOW is not deleted, move its buffer to
  the end of WINDOW's previous buffers so it's less likely that a
  future invocation of `switch-to-prev-buffer' will switch to it.
  Also, move the buffer to the end of the frame's buffer list.</p>
<p>
`bury' means that if WINDOW is not deleted, remove its buffer
  from WINDOW'S list of previous buffers.  Also, move the buffer
  to the end of the frame's buffer list.  This value provides the
  most reliable remedy to not have `switch-to-prev-buffer' switch
  to this buffer again without killing the buffer.</p>
<p>
`kill' means to kill WINDOW's buffer.<a name="display-buffer-below-selected"></a>
<h3>Function: display-buffer-below-selected</h3>

<p>
(fn ITEM SEQ [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="transpose-subr"></a>
<h3>Function: transpose-subr</h3>
Subroutine to do the work of transposing objects.
Works for lines, sentences, paragraphs, etc.  MOVER is a function that
moves forward by units of the given object (e.g. forward-sentence,
forward-paragraph).  If ARG is zero, exchanges the current object
with the one containing mark.  If ARG is an integer, moves the
current object past ARG following (if ARG is positive) or
preceding (if ARG is negative) objects, leaving point after the
current object.<a name="consp"></a>
<h3>Function: consp</h3>
Return t if OBJECT is a cons cell.</p>
<p>

(fn S1 S2)<a name="face-stipple"></a>
<h3>Function: face-stipple</h3>
Return the stipple pixmap name of FACE, or nil if unspecified.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.</p>
<p>
If INHERIT is nil, only a stipple directly defined by FACE is
  considered, so the return value may be nil.
If INHERIT is t, and FACE doesn't define a stipple, then any stipple
  that FACE inherits through its `:inherit' attribute is considered as
  well; however the return value may still be nil.
If INHERIT is a face or a list of faces, then it is used to try to
  resolve an unspecified stipple.</p>
<p>
To ensure that a valid stipple or nil is always returned, use a value of
`default' for INHERIT; this will resolve any unspecified values by merging
with the `default' face (which is always completely specified).<a name="xw-color-values"></a>
<h3>Function: xw-color-values</h3>
Internal function called by `color-values', which see.</p>
<p>
(fn COLOR &optional FRAME)<a name="set-time-zone-rule"></a>

Instead of calling this function, you typically want (setenv "TZ" TZ).
That changes both the environment of the Emacs process and the
variable `process-environment', whereas `set-time-zone-rule' affects
only the former.</p>

PROMPT is the prompt string.  PREV-DIR/FILE is the (DIRECTORY . FILE) pair
from the last source processing command.  SOURCE-MODES is a list of major
modes used to determine what file buffers contain source files.  (These
two arguments are used for determining defaults.)  If MUSTMATCH-P is true,
then the filename reader will only accept a file that exists.</p>
<p>
A typical use:
 (interactive (comint-get-source "Compile file: " prev-lisp-dir/file
                                 '(lisp-mode) t))</p>
<p>
(fn PROMPT PREV-DIR/FILE SOURCE-MODES MUSTMATCH-P)<a name="modify-all-frames-parameters"></a>
<h3>Function: modify-all-frames-parameters</h3>
Modify all current and future frames' parameters according to ALIST.
This changes `default-frame-alist' and possibly `initial-frame-alist'.
Furthermore, this function removes all parameters in ALIST from
`window-system-default-frame-alist'.
See help of `modify-frame-parameters' for more information.<a name="mm-url-insert-file-contents-external"></a>
<h3>Function: mm-url-insert-file-contents-external</h3>
Insert file contents of URL using `mm-url-program'.</p>
<p>
(fn URL)<a name="ispell-word"></a>
<h3>Function: ispell-word</h3>
Check spelling of word under or before the cursor.
If the word is not found in dictionary, display possible corrections
in a window allowing you to choose one.</p>
<p>
If optional argument FOLLOWING is non-nil or if `ispell-following-word'
is non-nil when called interactively, then the following word
(rather than preceding) is checked when the cursor is not over a word.
When the optional argument QUIETLY is non-nil or `ispell-quietly' is non-nil
when called interactively, non-corrective messages are suppressed.</p>
<p>
With a prefix argument (or if CONTINUE is non-nil),
resume interrupted spell-checking of a buffer or region.</p>
<p>
Interactively, in Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, call
`ispell-region' to check the active region for spelling errors.</p>
<p>
Word syntax is controlled by the definition of the chosen dictionary,
which is in `ispell-local-dictionary-alist' or `ispell-dictionary-alist'.</p>
<p>
This will check or reload the dictionary.  Use M-x ispell-change-dictionary
or M-x ispell-region to update the Ispell process.</p>
<p>
Return values:
nil           word is correct or spelling is accepted.
0             word is inserted into buffer-local definitions.
"word"        word corrected from word list.
("word" arg)  word is hand entered.

<h3>Function: pr-despool-preview</h3>
Preview spooled PostScript.</p>
<p>
Interactively, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the
user for a file name, and saves the spooled PostScript image in that file
instead of saving it in a temporary file.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, the argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it is nil,
save the image in a temporary file.  If FILENAME is a string, save the
PostScript image in a file with that name.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FILENAME)<a name="file-in-directory-p"></a>

Dired sets `revert-buffer-function' to this function.  The args
ARG and NOCONFIRM, passed from `revert-buffer', are ignored.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG NOCONFIRM)<a name="spam-report-url-ping-mm-url"></a>
<h3>Function: spam-report-url-ping-mm-url</h3>
Ping a host through HTTP, addressing a specific GET resource. Use
the external program specified in `mm-url-program' to connect to
server.</p>
<p>
(fn HOST REPORT)<a name="face-nontrivial-p"></a>
<h3>Function: face-nontrivial-p</h3>
True if face FACE has some non-nil attribute.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.<a name="make-coding-system"></a>

<p>
(fn)<a name="vc-make-version-backup"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-make-version-backup</h3>
Make a backup copy of FILE, which is assumed in sync with the repository.
Before doing that, check if there are any old backups and get rid of them.<a name="flush-lines"></a>
<h3>Function: flush-lines</h3>
Delete lines containing matches for REGEXP.
When called from Lisp (and usually when called interactively as
well, see below), applies to the part of the buffer after point.
The line point is in is deleted if and only if it contains a
match for regexp starting after point.</p>
<p>
If REGEXP contains upper case characters (excluding those preceded by `\')
and `search-upper-case' is non-nil, the matching is case-sensitive.</p>
<p>
Second and third arg RSTART and REND specify the region to operate on.
Lines partially contained in this region are deleted if and only if
they contain a match entirely contained in it.</p>
<p>
Interactively, in Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, operate
on the contents of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the
end of (the accessible portion of) the buffer.  When calling this function
from Lisp, you can pretend that it was called interactively by passing
a non-nil INTERACTIVE argument.</p>
<p>
If a match is split across lines, all the lines it lies in are deleted.
They are deleted _before_ looking for the next match.  Hence, a match
starting on the same line at which another match ended is ignored.<a name="set-variable"></a>
<h3>Function: set-variable</h3>
Set VARIABLE to VALUE.  VALUE is a Lisp object.
VARIABLE should be a user option variable name, a Lisp variable
meant to be customized by users.  You should enter VALUE in Lisp syntax,
so if you want VALUE to be a string, you must surround it with doublequotes.
VALUE is used literally, not evaluated.</p>
<p>
If VARIABLE has a `variable-interactive' property, that is used as if
it were the arg to `interactive' (which see) to interactively read VALUE.</p>
<p>
If VARIABLE has been defined with `defcustom', then the type information
in the definition is used to check that VALUE is valid.</p>
<p>
With a prefix argument, set VARIABLE to VALUE buffer-locally.<a name="newsticker-plainview"></a>
<h3>Function: newsticker-plainview</h3>

(fn &optional ARG)<a name="make-overlay"></a>
<h3>Function: make-overlay</h3>
Create a new overlay with range BEG to END in BUFFER.
If omitted, BUFFER defaults to the current buffer.
BEG and END may be integers or markers.
The fourth arg FRONT-ADVANCE, if non-nil, makes the marker
for the front of the overlay advance when text is inserted there
(which means the text *is not* included in the overlay).
The fifth arg REAR-ADVANCE, if non-nil, makes the marker
for the rear of the overlay advance when text is inserted there
(which means the text *is* included in the overlay).</p>

<h3>Function: -tree-reduce-from</h3>
Use FN to reduce elements of list TREE.
If elements of TREE are lists themselves, apply the reduction recursively.</p>
<p>
FN is first applied to INIT-VALUE and first element of the list,
then on this result and second element from the list etc.</p>
<p>
The initial value is ignored on cons pairs as they always contain
two elements.</p>

Display fringes only on the right of each window.<a name="facemenu-add-face"></a>
<h3>Function: facemenu-add-face</h3>
Add FACE to text between START and END.
If START is nil or START to END is empty, add FACE to next typed character
instead.  For each section of that region that has a different face property,
FACE will be consed onto it, and other faces that are completely hidden by
that will be removed from the list.
If `facemenu-add-face-function' and maybe `facemenu-end-add-face' are non-nil,
they are used to set the face information.</p>
<p>
As a special case, if FACE is `default', then the region is left with NO face
text property.  Otherwise, selecting the default face would not have any
effect.  See `facemenu-remove-face-function'.<a name="toggle-tool-bar-mode-from-frame"></a>

WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
The returned height does not include the mode line or header line.
On a graphical display, the height is expressed as an integer multiple
of the default character height.  If a line at the bottom of the text
area is only partially visible, that counts as a whole line; to
exclude partially-visible lines, use `window-text-height'.</p>

<p>
(fn FUNCTION SEQUENCE)<a name="idlwave-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: idlwave-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing IDL source files (version 6.1_em22).</p>
<p>
The main features of this mode are</p>
<p>
1. Indentation and Formatting
   --------------------------
   Like other Emacs programming modes, C-j inserts a newline and indents.
   TAB is used for explicit indentation of the current line.</p>
<p>
   To start a continuation line, use M-x idlwave-split-line.  This
   function can also be used in the middle of a line to split the line
   at that point.  When used inside a long constant string, the string
   is split at that point with the `+' concatenation operator.</p>
<p>
   Comments are indented as follows:</p>
<p>
   `;;;' Indentation remains unchanged.
   `;;'  Indent like the surrounding code
   `;'   Indent to a minimum column.</p>
<p>
   The indentation of comments starting in column 0 is never changed.</p>
<p>
   Use M-x idlwave-fill-paragraph to refill a paragraph inside a
   comment.  The indentation of the second line of the paragraph
   relative to the first will be retained.  Use
   M-x idlwave-auto-fill-mode to toggle auto-fill mode for these
   comments.  When the variable `idlwave-fill-comment-line-only' is
   nil, code can also be auto-filled and auto-indented.</p>
<p>
   To convert pre-existing IDL code to your formatting style, mark the
   entire buffer with C-x h and execute
   M-x idlwave-expand-region-abbrevs.  Then mark the entire buffer
   again followed by C-M-\ (`indent-region').</p>
<p>
2. Routine Info
   ------------
   IDLWAVE displays information about the calling sequence and the
   accepted keyword parameters of a procedure or function with
   M-x idlwave-routine-info.  M-x idlwave-find-module jumps to the
   source file of a module.  These commands know about system
   routines, all routines in idlwave-mode buffers and (when the
   idlwave-shell is active) about all modules currently compiled under
   this shell.  It also makes use of pre-compiled or custom-scanned
   user and library catalogs many popular libraries ship with by
   default.  Use M-x idlwave-update-routine-info to update this
   information, which is also used for completion (see item 4).</p>
<p>
3. Online IDL Help
   ---------------</p>
<p>
   M-x idlwave-context-help displays the IDL documentation relevant
   for the system variable, keyword, or routines at point.  A single
   key stroke gets you directly to the right place in the docs.  See
   the manual to configure where and how the HTML help is displayed.</p>
<p>
4. Completion
   ----------
   M-x idlwave-complete completes the names of procedures, functions
   class names, keyword parameters, system variables and tags, class
   tags, structure tags, filenames and much more.  It is context
   sensitive and figures out what is expected at point.  Lower case
   strings are completed in lower case, other strings in mixed or
   upper case.</p>
<p>
5. Code Templates and Abbreviations
   --------------------------------
   Many Abbreviations are predefined to expand to code fragments and templates.
   The abbreviations start generally with a `\`.  Some examples:</p>
<p>
   \pr        PROCEDURE template
   \fu        FUNCTION template
   \c         CASE statement template
   \sw        SWITCH statement template
   \f         FOR loop template
   \r         REPEAT Loop template
   \w         WHILE loop template
   \i         IF statement template
   \elif      IF-ELSE statement template
   \b         BEGIN</p>
<p>
   For a full list, use M-x idlwave-list-abbrevs.  Some templates also
   have direct keybindings - see the list of keybindings below.</p>
<p>
   M-x idlwave-doc-header inserts a documentation header at the
   beginning of the current program unit (pro, function or main).
   Change log entries can be added to the current program unit with
   M-x idlwave-doc-modification.</p>
<p>
6. Automatic Case Conversion
   -------------------------
   The case of reserved words and some abbrevs is controlled by
   `idlwave-reserved-word-upcase' and `idlwave-abbrev-change-case'.</p>
<p>
7. Automatic END completion
   ------------------------

Optional arg WHOAMI (interactive prefix) non-nil means prompt for user
name and email (stored in `add-log-full-name' and `add-log-mailing-address').</p>
<p>
Second arg FILE-NAME is file name of the change log.
If nil, use the value of `change-log-default-name'.</p>
<p>
Third arg OTHER-WINDOW non-nil means visit in other window.</p>
<p>
Fourth arg NEW-ENTRY non-nil means always create a new entry at the front;

non-nil, otherwise in local time.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WHOAMI FILE-NAME OTHER-WINDOW NEW-ENTRY PUT-NEW-ENTRY-ON-NEW-LINE)<a name="epa-verify-cleartext-in-region"></a>
<h3>Function: epa-verify-cleartext-in-region</h3>
Verify OpenPGP cleartext signed messages in the current region
between START and END.</p>
<p>
Don't use this command in Lisp programs!
See the reason described in the `epa-verify-region' documentation.</p>
<p>
(fn START END)<a name="standard-display-cyrillic-translit"></a>
<h3>Function: standard-display-cyrillic-translit</h3>
Display a cyrillic buffer using a transliteration.
For readability, the table is slightly
different from the one used for the input method `cyrillic-translit'.</p>
<p>
The argument is a string which specifies which language you are using;
that affects the choice of transliterations slightly.
Possible values are listed in `cyrillic-language-alist'.
If the argument is t, we use the default cyrillic transliteration.
If the argument is nil, we return the display table to its standard state.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional CYRILLIC-LANGUAGE)<a name="align-regexp"></a>
<h3>Function: align-regexp</h3>
Align the current region using an ad-hoc rule read from the minibuffer.
BEG and END mark the limits of the region.  This function will prompt
for the REGEXP to align with.  If no prefix arg was specified, you
only need to supply the characters to be lined up and any preceding
whitespace is replaced.  If a prefix arg was specified, the full
regexp with parenthesized whitespace should be supplied; it will also
prompt for which parenthesis GROUP within REGEXP to modify, the amount
of SPACING to use, and whether or not to REPEAT the rule throughout
the line.  See `align-rules-list' for more information about these
options.</p>
<p>
For example, let's say you had a list of phone numbers, and wanted to
align them so that the opening parentheses would line up:</p>
<p>
    Fred (123) 456-7890
    Alice (123) 456-7890
    Mary-Anne (123) 456-7890
    Joe (123) 456-7890</p>
<p>
There is no predefined rule to handle this, but you could easily do it
using a REGEXP like "(".  All you would have to do is to mark the
region, call `align-regexp' and type in that regular expression.</p>

<h3>Function: use-global-map</h3>

<p>
(fn KEYMAP)<a name="auth-source-search"></a>
<h3>Function: auth-source-search</h3>
Search or modify authentication backends according to SPEC.</p>
<p>
This function parses `auth-sources' for matches of the SPEC
plist.  It can optionally create or update an authentication
token if requested.  A token is just a standard Emacs property
list with a :secret property that can be a function; all the
other properties will always hold scalar values.</p>
<p>
Typically the :secret property, if present, contains a password.</p>
<p>
Common search keys are :max, :host, :port, and :user.  In
addition, :create specifies how tokens will be or created.
Finally, :type can specify which backend types you want to check.</p>
<p>
A string value is always matched literally.  A symbol is matched
as its string value, literally.  All the SPEC values can be
single values (symbol or string) or lists thereof (in which case
any of the search terms matches).</p>
<p>
:create t means to create a token if possible.</p>
<p>
A new token will be created if no matching tokens were found.
The new token will have only the keys the backend requires.  For
the netrc backend, for instance, that's the user, host, and
port keys.</p>
<p>
Here's an example:</p>
<p>
(let ((auth-source-creation-defaults '((user . "defaultUser")
                                        (A    . "default A"))))
  (auth-source-search :host "mine" :type 'netrc :max 1
                      :P "pppp" :Q "qqqq"
                      :create t))</p>
<p>
which says:</p>
<p>
"Search for any entry matching host 'mine' in backends of type
 'netrc', maximum one result.</p>
<p>
 Create a new entry if you found none.  The netrc backend will
 automatically require host, user, and port.  The host will be
 'mine'.  We prompt for the user with default 'defaultUser' and
 for the port without a default.  We will not prompt for A, Q,
 or P.  The resulting token will only have keys user, host, and
 port."</p>
<p>
:create '(A B C) also means to create a token if possible.</p>
<p>
The behavior is like :create t but if the list contains any
parameter, that parameter will be required in the resulting
token.  The value for that parameter will be obtained from the
search parameters or from user input.  If any queries are needed,
the alist `auth-source-creation-defaults' will be checked for the
default value.  If the user, host, or port are missing, the alist
`auth-source-creation-prompts' will be used to look up the
prompts IN THAT ORDER (so the 'user prompt will be queried first,
then 'host, then 'port, and finally 'secret).  Each prompt string
can use %u, %h, and %p to show the user, host, and port.</p>
<p>
Here's an example:</p>
<p>
(let ((auth-source-creation-defaults '((user . "defaultUser")
                                        (A    . "default A")))
       (auth-source-creation-prompts
        '((password . "Enter IMAP password for %h:%p: "))))
  (auth-source-search :host '("nonesuch" "twosuch") :type 'netrc :max 1
                      :P "pppp" :Q "qqqq"
                      :create '(A B Q)))</p>
<p>
which says:</p>
<p>
"Search for any entry matching host 'nonesuch'
 or 'twosuch' in backends of type 'netrc', maximum one result.</p>
<p>
 Create a new entry if you found none.  The netrc backend will
 automatically require host, user, and port.  The host will be
 'nonesuch' and Q will be 'qqqq'.  We prompt for the password
 with the shown prompt.  We will not prompt for Q.  The resulting
 token will have keys user, host, port, A, B, and Q.  It will not
 have P with any value, even though P is used in the search to
 find only entries that have P set to 'pppp'."</p>
<p>
When multiple values are specified in the search parameter, the
user is prompted for which one.  So :host (X Y Z) would ask the
user to choose between X, Y, and Z.</p>
<p>
This creation can fail if the search was not specific enough to
create a new token (it's up to the backend to decide that).  You
should `catch' the backend-specific error as usual.  Some
backends (netrc, at least) will prompt the user rather than throw
an error.</p>
<p>
:require (A B C) means that only results that contain those
tokens will be returned.  Thus for instance requiring :secret
will ensure that any results will actually have a :secret
property.</p>
<p>
:delete t means to delete any found entries.  nil by default.
Use `auth-source-delete' in ELisp code instead of calling
`auth-source-search' directly with this parameter.</p>
<p>
:type (X Y Z) will check only those backend types.  'netrc and
'secrets are the only ones supported right now.</p>
<p>
:max N means to try to return at most N items (defaults to 1).
When 0 the function will return just t or nil to indicate if any
matches were found.  More than N items may be returned, depending
on the search and the backend.</p>
<p>
:host (X Y Z) means to match only hosts X, Y, or Z according to
the match rules above.  Defaults to t.</p>
<p>
:user (X Y Z) means to match only users X, Y, or Z according to
the match rules above.  Defaults to t.</p>
<p>
:port (P Q R) means to match only protocols P, Q, or R.
Defaults to t.</p>
<p>
:K (V1 V2 V3) for any other key K will match values V1, V2, or
V3 (note the match rules above).</p>
<p>
The return value is a list with at most :max tokens.  Each token
is a plist with keys :backend :host :port :user, plus any other
keys provided by the backend (notably :secret).  But note the
exception for :max 0, which see above.</p>
<p>
The token can hold a :save-function key.  If you call that, the
user will be prompted to save the data to the backend.  You can't
request that this should happen right after creation, because
`auth-source-search' has no way of knowing if the token is
actually useful.  So the caller must arrange to call this function.</p>
<p>
The token's :secret key can hold a function.  In that case you
must call it to obtain the actual value.</p>

<h3>Function: ethio-fidel-to-sera-region</h3>
Replace all the FIDEL characters in the region to the SERA format.</p>
<p>
The variable `ethio-primary-language' specifies the primary
language and `ethio-secondary-language' specifies the secondary.</p>
<p>
If the 3rd argument SECONDARY is given and non-nil, convert
the region so that it begins with the secondary language; otherwise with
the primary language.</p>
<p>
If the 4th argument FORCE is given and non-nil, convert even if the
buffer is read-only.</p>
<p>
See also the descriptions of the variables

<p>
(fn BEGIN END &optional SECONDARY FORCE)<a name="command-apropos"></a>
<h3>Function: command-apropos</h3>
Show commands (interactively callable functions) that match PATTERN.
PATTERN can be a word, a list of words (separated by spaces),
or a regexp (using some regexp special characters).  If it is a word,
search for matches for that word as a substring.  If it is a list of words,
search for matches for any two (or more) of those words.</p>
<p>
With C-u prefix, or if `apropos-do-all' is non-nil, also show
noninteractive functions.</p>
<p>
If VAR-PREDICATE is non-nil, show only variables, and only those that
satisfy the predicate VAR-PREDICATE.</p>
<p>
When called from a Lisp program, a string PATTERN is used as a regexp,
while a list of strings is used as a word list.<a name=">="></a>

Perform the handling specified by `yank-handled-properties', then
remove properties specified by `yank-excluded-properties'.<a name="x-focus-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: x-focus-frame</h3>
Set the input focus to FRAME.
FRAME nil means use the selected frame.</p>
<p>
(fn FRAME)<a name="set-marker"></a>
<h3>Function: set-marker</h3>
Position MARKER before character number POSITION in BUFFER,
which defaults to the current buffer.  If POSITION is nil,
makes marker point nowhere so it no longer slows down
editing in any buffer.  Returns MARKER.</p>
<p>
(fn MARKER POSITION &optional BUFFER)<a name="easy-menu-item-present-p"></a>
<h3>Function: easy-menu-item-present-p</h3>
In submenu of MAP with path PATH, return non-nil if item NAME is present.

<h3>Function: pop-tag-mark</h3>
Pop back to where M-. was last invoked.</p>
<p>
This is distinct from invoking M-. with a negative argument
since that pops a stack of markers at which tags were found, not from
where they were found.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="apropos-words-to-regexp"></a>
<h3>Function: apropos-words-to-regexp</h3>
Make regexp matching any two of the words in WORDS.<a name="flycheck-display-error-messages-unless-error-list"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-display-error-messages-unless-error-list</h3>

<p>
Like `flycheck-display-error-messages', but only if the error
list (see `flycheck-list-errors') is not visible in any window in
the current frame.<a name="trace-function"></a>
<h3>Function: trace-function</h3>
Traces FUNCTION with trace output going to BUFFER.
For every call of FUNCTION Lisp-style trace messages that display argument
and return values will be inserted into BUFFER.  This function generates the
trace advice for FUNCTION and activates it together with any other advice
there might be!!  The trace BUFFER will popup whenever FUNCTION is called.
Do not use this to trace functions that switch buffers or do any other
display oriented stuff, use `trace-function-background' instead.</p>
<p>
To untrace a function, use `untrace-function' or `untrace-all'.</p>
<p>
(fn FUNCTION &optional BUFFER)<a name="sql-informix"></a>
<h3>Function: sql-informix</h3>
Run dbaccess by Informix as an inferior process.</p>
<p>
If buffer `*SQL*' exists but no process is running, make a new process.
If buffer exists and a process is running, just switch to buffer
`*SQL*'.</p>
<p>
Interpreter used comes from variable `sql-informix-program'.  Login uses
the variable `sql-database' as default, if set.</p>
<p>
The buffer is put in SQL interactive mode, giving commands for sending
input.  See `sql-interactive-mode'.</p>
<p>
To set the buffer name directly, use C-u
before M-x sql-informix.  Once session has started,
M-x sql-rename-buffer can be called separately to rename the
buffer.</p>
<p>
To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the input and output to the process, use C-x RET c
before M-x sql-informix.  You can also specify this with C-x RET p
in the SQL buffer, after you start the process.
The default comes from `process-coding-system-alist' and
`default-process-coding-system'.</p>
<p>
(Type C-h m in the SQL buffer for a list of commands.)</p>
<p>
(fn &optional BUFFER)<a name="speedbar"></a>
<h3>Function: speedbar</h3>
Enable or disable speedbar.  Positive ARG means turn on, negative turn off.
A nil ARG means toggle.  Once the speedbar frame is activated, a buffer in
`speedbar-mode' will be displayed.  Currently, only one speedbar is
supported at a time.
`speedbar-before-popup-hook' is called before popping up the speedbar frame.
`speedbar-before-delete-hook' is called before the frame is deleted.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="read-charset"></a>
<h3>Function: read-charset</h3>
Read a character set from the minibuffer, prompting with string PROMPT.
It must be an Emacs character set listed in the variable `charset-list'.</p>
<p>
Optional arguments are DEFAULT-VALUE and INITIAL-INPUT.
DEFAULT-VALUE, if non-nil, is the default value.
INITIAL-INPUT, if non-nil, is a string inserted in the minibuffer initially.
See the documentation of the function `completing-read' for the detailed
meanings of these arguments.</p>
<p>
(fn PROMPT &optional DEFAULT-VALUE INITIAL-INPUT)<a name="global-ede-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: global-ede-mode</h3>
Toggle global EDE (Emacs Development Environment) mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable global EDE mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
This global minor mode enables `ede-minor-mode' in all buffers in
an EDE controlled project.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="bookmark-load"></a>
<h3>Function: bookmark-load</h3>
Load bookmarks from FILE (which must be in bookmark format).
Appends loaded bookmarks to the front of the list of bookmarks.  If
optional second argument OVERWRITE is non-nil, existing bookmarks are
destroyed.  Optional third arg NO-MSG means don't display any messages
while loading.</p>
<p>
If you load a file that doesn't contain a proper bookmark alist, you
will corrupt Emacs's bookmark list.  Generally, you should only load
in files that were created with the bookmark functions in the first
place.  Your own personal bookmark file, `~/.emacs.bmk', is
maintained automatically by Emacs; you shouldn't need to load it
explicitly.</p>
<p>
If you load a file containing bookmarks with the same names as
bookmarks already present in your Emacs, the new bookmarks will get
unique numeric suffixes "<2>", "<3>", ... following the same
method buffers use to resolve name collisions.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE &optional OVERWRITE NO-MSG)<a name="delete-auto-save-file-if-necessary"></a>
<h3>Function: delete-auto-save-file-if-necessary</h3>
Delete auto-save file for current buffer if `delete-auto-save-files' is t.

<h3>Function: isearch-backward-regexp</h3>
Do incremental search backward for regular expression.
With a prefix argument, do a regular string search instead.
Like ordinary incremental search except that your input is treated
as a regexp.  See the command `isearch-forward' for more information.<a name="mark-paragraph"></a>
<h3>Function: mark-paragraph</h3>
Put point at beginning of this paragraph, mark at end.
The paragraph marked is the one that contains point or follows point.</p>
<p>
With argument ARG, puts mark at end of a following paragraph, so that
the number of paragraphs marked equals ARG.</p>
<p>
If ARG is negative, point is put at end of this paragraph, mark is put
at beginning of this or a previous paragraph.</p>
<p>
Interactively (or if ALLOW-EXTEND is non-nil), if this command is
repeated or (in Transient Mark mode) if the mark is active,
it marks the next ARG paragraphs after the ones already marked.<a name="buffer-modified-tick"></a>
<h3>Function: buffer-modified-tick</h3>
Return BUFFER's tick counter, incremented for each change in text.
Each buffer has a tick counter which is incremented each time the
text in that buffer is changed.  It wraps around occasionally.
No argument or nil as argument means use current buffer as BUFFER.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional BUFFER)<a name="detect-coding-region"></a>
<h3>Function: detect-coding-region</h3>
Detect coding system of the text in the region between START and END.
Return a list of possible coding systems ordered by priority.
The coding systems to try and their priorities follows what
the function `coding-system-priority-list' (which see) returns.</p>
<p>
If only ASCII characters are found (except for such ISO-2022 control
characters as ESC), it returns a list of single element `undecided'
or its subsidiary coding system according to a detected end-of-line
format.</p>
<p>
If optional argument HIGHEST is non-nil, return the coding system of
highest priority.</p>
<p>

directory.</p>
<p>
With prefix arg of C-u, only find log entries for the current buffer's file.</p>
<p>
With any numeric prefix arg, find log entries for all currently visited
files that are under version control.  This puts all the entries in the
log for the default directory, which may not be appropriate.</p>
<p>
From a program, any ARGS are assumed to be filenames for which
log entries should be gathered.</p>
<p>
(fn &rest ARGS)<a name="pr-txt-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: pr-txt-mode</h3>
Print major mode using text printer.</p>

<h3>Function: window-resize-apply</h3>
Apply requested size values for window-tree of FRAME.
Optional argument HORIZONTAL omitted or nil means apply requested height
values.  HORIZONTAL non-nil means apply requested width values.</p>
<p>
This function checks whether the requested values sum up to a valid
window layout, recursively assigns the new sizes of all child windows
and calculates and assigns the new start positions of these windows.</p>
<p>
Note: This function does not check any of `window-fixed-size-p',
`window-min-height' or `window-min-width'.  All these checks have to
be applied on the Elisp level.</p>

nil otherwise.<a name="ert-select-tests"></a>
<h3>Function: ert-select-tests</h3>
Return a list of tests that match SELECTOR.</p>
<p>
UNIVERSE specifies the set of tests to select from; it should be a list
of tests, or t, which refers to all tests named by symbols in `obarray'.</p>
<p>
Valid SELECTORs:</p>
<p>
nil  -- Selects the empty set.
t    -- Selects UNIVERSE.
:new -- Selects all tests that have not been run yet.
:failed, :passed       -- Select tests according to their most recent result.
:expected, :unexpected -- Select tests according to their most recent result.
a string -- A regular expression selecting all tests with matching names.
a test   -- (i.e., an object of the ert-test data-type) Selects that test.
a symbol -- Selects the test that the symbol names, errors if none.
(member TESTS...) -- Selects the elements of TESTS, a list of tests
    or symbols naming tests.
(eql TEST) -- Selects TEST, a test or a symbol naming a test.
(and SELECTORS...) -- Selects the tests that match all SELECTORS.
(or SELECTORS...)  -- Selects the tests that match any of the SELECTORS.
(not SELECTOR)     -- Selects all tests that do not match SELECTOR.
(tag TAG) -- Selects all tests that have TAG on their tags list.
    A tag is an arbitrary label you can apply when you define a test.
(satisfies PREDICATE) -- Selects all tests that satisfy PREDICATE.
    PREDICATE is a function that takes an ert-test object as argument,
    and returns non-nil if it is selected.</p>
<p>
Only selectors that require a superset of tests, such
as (satisfies ...), strings, :new, etc. make use of UNIVERSE.
Selectors that do not, such as (member ...), just return the
set implied by them without checking whether it is really
contained in UNIVERSE.<a name="minibuffer-completion-help"></a>
<h3>Function: minibuffer-completion-help</h3>
Display a list of possible completions of the current minibuffer contents.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="window-prev-buffers"></a>
<h3>Function: window-prev-buffers</h3>
Return buffers previously shown in WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
The return value is a list of elements (BUFFER WINDOW-START POS),
where BUFFER is a buffer, WINDOW-START is the start position of the
window for that buffer, and POS is a window-specific point value.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WINDOW)<a name="vc-git--out-ok"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-git--out-ok</h3></p>
<p>

(fn COMMAND &rest ARGS)<a name="replace-regexp"></a>
<h3>Function: replace-regexp</h3>
Replace things after point matching REGEXP with TO-STRING.
Preserve case in each match if `case-replace' and `case-fold-search'
are non-nil and REGEXP has no uppercase letters.</p>
<p>
If `replace-regexp-lax-whitespace' is non-nil, a space or spaces in the regexp
to be replaced will match a sequence of whitespace chars defined by the
regexp in `search-whitespace-regexp'.</p>
<p>
In Transient Mark mode, if the mark is active, operate on the contents
of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the end of the buffer.</p>
<p>
Third arg DELIMITED (prefix arg if interactive), if non-nil, means replace
only matches surrounded by word boundaries.
Fourth and fifth arg START and END specify the region to operate on.</p>
<p>
In TO-STRING, `\&' stands for whatever matched the whole of REGEXP,
and `\N' (where N is a digit) stands for
whatever what matched the Nth `\(...\)' in REGEXP.
`\?' lets you edit the replacement text in the minibuffer
at the given position for each replacement.</p>
<p>
In interactive calls, the replacement text may contain `\,'
followed by a Lisp expression used as part of the replacement
text.  Inside of that expression, `\&' is a string denoting the
whole match, `\N' a partial match, `\#&' and `\#N' the respective
numeric values from `string-to-number', and `\#' itself for
`replace-count', the number of replacements occurred so far.</p>
<p>
If your Lisp expression is an identifier and the next letter in
the replacement string would be interpreted as part of it, you
can wrap it with an expression like `\,(or \#)'.  Incidentally,
for this particular case you may also enter `\#' in the
replacement text directly.</p>
<p>
When using those Lisp features interactively in the replacement
text, TO-STRING is actually made a list instead of a string.
Use C-x M-: after this command for details.</p>
<p>
Use M-n to pull the last incremental search regexp to the minibuffer
that reads REGEXP.</p>
<p>
This function is usually the wrong thing to use in a Lisp program.
What you probably want is a loop like this:
  (while (re-search-forward REGEXP nil t)
    (replace-match TO-STRING nil nil))
which will run faster and will not set the mark or print anything.<a name="add-to-history"></a>
<h3>Function: add-to-history</h3>
Add NEWELT to the history list stored in the variable HISTORY-VAR.
Return the new history list.
If MAXELT is non-nil, it specifies the maximum length of the history.
Otherwise, the maximum history length is the value of the `history-length'
property on symbol HISTORY-VAR, if set, or the value of the `history-length'
variable.
Remove duplicates of NEWELT if `history-delete-duplicates' is non-nil.
If optional fourth arg KEEP-ALL is non-nil, add NEWELT to history even
if it is empty or a duplicate.<a name="internal-make-var-non-special"></a>
<h3>Function: internal-make-var-non-special</h3>
Internal function.</p>
<p>
(fn SYMBOL)<a name="widget-get-indirect"></a>
<h3>Function: widget-get-indirect</h3>

(fn WIDGET PROPERTY)<a name="byte-compile-unwind-protect"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-compile-unwind-protect</h3></p>
<p>

(fn FORM)<a name="describe-buffer-case-table"></a>
<h3>Function: describe-buffer-case-table</h3>
Describe the case table of the current buffer.<a name="table-shorten-cell"></a>
<h3>Function: table-shorten-cell</h3>
Shorten the current cell by N lines by shrinking the cell vertically.
Shortening is done by removing blank lines from the bottom of the cell
and possibly from the top of the cell as well.  Therefore, the cell
must have some bottom/top blank lines to be shorten effectively.  This
is applicable to all the cells aligned horizontally with the current
one because they are also shortened in order to keep the rectangular
table structure.</p>
<p>
(fn N)<a name="nested-alist-p"></a>
<h3>Function: nested-alist-p</h3>
Return t if OBJ is a nested alist.</p>
<p>
Nested alist is a list of the form (ENTRY . BRANCHES), where ENTRY is
any Lisp object, and BRANCHES is a list of cons cells of the form
(KEY-ELEMENT . NESTED-ALIST).</p>
<p>
You can use a nested alist to store any Lisp object (ENTRY) for a key
sequence KEYSEQ, where KEYSEQ is a sequence of KEY-ELEMENT.  KEYSEQ
can be a string, a vector, or a list.<a name="eudc-insert-record-at-point-into-bbdb"></a>
<h3>Function: eudc-insert-record-at-point-into-bbdb</h3>
Insert record at point into the BBDB database.
This function can only be called from a directory query result buffer.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="kill-process"></a>
<h3>Function: kill-process</h3>
Kill process PROCESS.  May be process or name of one.
See function `interrupt-process' for more details on usage.</p>

<h3>Function: byte-compile-find-bound-condition</h3></p>
<p>

(fn CONDITION-PARAM PRED-LIST &optional ONLY-IF-NOT-PRESENT)<a name="nsubst"></a>
<h3>Function: nsubst</h3>
Substitute NEW for OLD everywhere in TREE (destructively).
Any element of TREE which is `eql' to OLD is changed to NEW (via a call
to `setcar').</p>
<p>
Keywords supported:  :test :test-not :key</p>
<p>
(fn NEW OLD TREE [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="indent-rigidly"></a>
<h3>Function: indent-rigidly</h3>
Indent all lines starting in the region sideways by ARG columns.
Called from a program, takes three arguments, START, END and ARG.
You can remove all indentation from a region by giving a large negative ARG.<a name="load-history-filename-element"></a>
<h3>Function: load-history-filename-element</h3>
Get the first elt of `load-history' whose car matches FILE-REGEXP.
Return nil if there isn't one.<a name="delete-terminal"></a>
<h3>Function: delete-terminal</h3>
Delete TERMINAL by deleting all frames on it and closing the terminal.
TERMINAL may be a terminal object, a frame, or nil (meaning the
selected frame's terminal).</p>
<p>
Normally, you may not delete a display if all other displays are suspended,
but if the second argument FORCE is non-nil, you may do so.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional TERMINAL FORCE)<a name="current-time-zone"></a>
<h3>Function: current-time-zone</h3>
Return the offset and name for the local time zone.
This returns a list of the form (OFFSET NAME).
OFFSET is an integer number of seconds ahead of UTC (east of Greenwich).
    A negative value means west of Greenwich.
NAME is a string giving the name of the time zone.
If SPECIFIED-TIME is given, the time zone offset is determined from it
instead of using the current time.  The argument should have the form
(HIGH LOW . IGNORED).  Thus, you can use times obtained from
`current-time' and from `file-attributes'.  SPECIFIED-TIME can also
have the form (HIGH . LOW), but this is considered obsolete.</p>
<p>
Some operating systems cannot provide all this information to Emacs;
in this case, `current-time-zone' returns a list containing nil for
the data it can't find.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional SPECIFIED-TIME)<a name="string-width"></a>
<h3>Function: string-width</h3>
Return width of STRING when displayed in the current buffer.
Width is measured by how many columns it occupies on the screen.
When calculating width of a multibyte character in STRING,
only the base leading-code is considered; the validity of
the following bytes is not checked.  Tabs in STRING are always
taken to occupy `tab-width' columns.</p>
<p>
(fn STRING)<a name="eieio-validate-class-slot-value"></a>
<h3>Function: eieio-validate-class-slot-value</h3>
Make sure that for CLASS referencing SLOT-IDX, VALUE is valid.

<p>
(fn)<a name="compilation-shell-minor-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: compilation-shell-minor-mode</h3>
Toggle Compilation Shell minor mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Compilation Shell minor mode
if ARG is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from
Lisp, enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When Compilation Shell minor mode is enabled, all the
error-parsing commands of the Compilation major mode are
available but bound to keys that don't collide with Shell mode.
See `compilation-mode'.<a name="custom-add-package-version"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-add-package-version</h3>
To the custom option SYMBOL add the package version VERSION.<a name="collapse-delayed-warnings"></a>
<h3>Function: collapse-delayed-warnings</h3>

Collapse identical adjacent warnings into one (plus count).
Used from `delayed-warnings-hook' (which see).<a name="epl-upgrade"></a>
<h3>Function: epl-upgrade</h3>
Upgrade PACKAGES.</p>
<p>
PACKAGES is a list of package objects to upgrade, defaulting to
all installed packages.</p>
<p>
The old versions of the updated packages are deleted, unless
PRESERVE-OBSOLETE is non-nil.</p>
<p>
Return a list of all performed upgrades, as a list of
`epl-upgrade' objects.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional PACKAGES PRESERVE-OBSOLETE)<a name="seq-filter"></a>

<h3>Function: sieve-upload</h3></p>
<p>

(fn &optional NAME)<a name="buffer-face-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: buffer-face-mode</h3>
Minor mode for a buffer-specific default face.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable the mode if ARG is positive,
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode
if ARG is omitted or nil.  When enabled, the face specified by the
variable `buffer-face-mode-face' is used to display the buffer text.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="describe-text-properties"></a>
<h3>Function: describe-text-properties</h3>
Describe widgets, buttons, overlays, and text properties at POS.
POS is taken to be in BUFFER or in current buffer if nil.
Interactively, describe them for the character after point.
If optional second argument OUTPUT-BUFFER is non-nil,
insert the output into that buffer, and don't initialize or clear it
otherwise.</p>
<p>
(fn POS &optional OUTPUT-BUFFER BUFFER)<a name="vc-after-save"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-after-save</h3>
Function to be called by `basic-save-buffer' (in files.el).<a name="sgml-slash"></a>
<h3>Function: sgml-slash</h3>
Insert ARG slash characters.
Behaves electrically if `sgml-quick-keys' is non-nil.<a name="cl-nth-value"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-nth-value</h3>
Evaluate EXPRESSION to get multiple values and return the Nth one.
This handles multiple values in Common Lisp style, but it does not work
right when EXPRESSION calls an ordinary Emacs Lisp function that returns just
one value.</p>
<p>
(fn N EXPRESSION)<a name="set-window-scroll-bars"></a>
<h3>Function: set-window-scroll-bars</h3>
Set width and type of scroll bars of window WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
Second parameter WIDTH specifies the pixel width for the scroll bar;
this is automatically adjusted to a multiple of the frame column width.
Third parameter VERTICAL-TYPE specifies the type of the vertical scroll
bar: left, right, or nil.
If WIDTH is nil, use the frame's scroll-bar width.
If VERTICAL-TYPE is t, use the frame's scroll-bar type.
Fourth parameter HORIZONTAL-TYPE is currently unused.</p>
<p>
(fn WINDOW WIDTH &optional VERTICAL-TYPE HORIZONTAL-TYPE)<a name="next-property-change"></a>
<h3>Function: next-property-change</h3>
Return the position of next property change.
Scans characters forward from POSITION in OBJECT till it finds
a change in some text property, then returns the position of the change.
If the optional second argument OBJECT is a buffer (or nil, which means
the current buffer), POSITION is a buffer position (integer or marker).
If OBJECT is a string, POSITION is a 0-based index into it.
Return nil if the property is constant all the way to the end of OBJECT.
If the value is non-nil, it is a position greater than POSITION, never equal.</p>
<p>
If the optional third argument LIMIT is non-nil, don't search
past position LIMIT; return LIMIT if nothing is found before LIMIT.</p>
<p>
(fn POSITION &optional OBJECT LIMIT)<a name="flycheck-package--check-macros-functions-available-in-emacs"></a>

<h3>Function: dash-enable-font-lock</h3>
Add syntax highlighting to dash functions, macros and magic values.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="mm-xemacs-find-mime-charset-1"></a>
<h3>Function: mm-xemacs-find-mime-charset-1</h3>
Determine which MIME charset to use to send region as message.
This uses the XEmacs-specific latin-unity package to better handle the
case where identical characters from diverse ISO-8859-? character sets
can be encoded using a single one of the corresponding coding systems.</p>
<p>
It treats `mm-coding-system-priorities' as the list of preferred
coding systems; a useful example setting for this list in Western
Europe would be '(iso-8859-1 iso-8859-15 utf-8), which would default
to the very standard Latin 1 coding system, and only move to coding
systems that are less supported as is necessary to encode the
characters that exist in the buffer.</p>
<p>
Latin Unity doesn't know about those non-ASCII Roman characters that
are available in various East Asian character sets.  As such, its
behavior if you have a JIS 0212 LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE in a
buffer and it can otherwise be encoded as Latin 1, won't be ideal.
But this is very much a corner case, so don't worry about it.<a name="Buffer-menu-backup-unmark"></a>
<h3>Function: Buffer-menu-backup-unmark</h3>
Move up and cancel all requested operations on buffer on line above.<a name="msb-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: msb-mode</h3>
Toggle Msb mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Msb mode if ARG is positive,
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode
if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
This mode overrides the binding(s) of `mouse-buffer-menu' to provide a
different buffer menu using the function `msb'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="ido-find-file-read-only-other-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: ido-find-file-read-only-other-frame</h3>

The file name is selected interactively by typing a substring.
For details of keybindings, see `ido-find-file'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="insert-directory-safely"></a>
<h3>Function: insert-directory-safely</h3>
Insert directory listing for FILE, formatted according to SWITCHES.</p>
<p>
Like `insert-directory', but if FILE does not exist, it inserts a
message to that effect instead of signaling an error.<a name="backward-paragraph"></a>
<h3>Function: backward-paragraph</h3>
Move backward to start of paragraph.
With argument ARG, do it ARG times;
a negative argument ARG = -N means move forward N paragraphs.</p>
<p>
A paragraph start is the beginning of a line which is a
`paragraph-start' or which is ordinary text and follows a
`paragraph-separate'ing line; except: if the first real line of a
paragraph is preceded by a blank line, the paragraph starts at that
blank line.</p>
<p>
See `forward-paragraph' for more information.<a name="iso-iso2sgml"></a>
<h3>Function: iso-iso2sgml</h3>
Translate ISO 8859-1 characters in the region to SGML entities.
Use entities from "ISO 8879:1986//ENTITIES Added Latin 1//EN".

Return the argument list for the compiled function FUNC.<a name="cl-gethash"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-gethash</h3>
Look up KEY in TABLE and return its associated value.
If KEY is not found, return DFLT which defaults to nil.</p>
<p>
(fn KEY TABLE &optional DFLT)<a name="pr-ps-directory-using-ghostscript"></a>
<h3>Function: pr-ps-directory-using-ghostscript</h3>
Print directory using PostScript through ghostscript.</p>
<p>
Interactively, the command prompts for N-UP printing number, a directory, a
file name regexp for matching and, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the
command prompts the user for a file name, and saves the PostScript image in
that file instead of saving it in a temporary file.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, if N-UP is nil, prompts for N-UP printing number.  If DIR is
nil, prompts for DIRectory.  If FILE-REGEXP is nil, prompts for
FILE(name)-REGEXP.  The argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it's nil,
save the image in a temporary file.  If FILENAME is a string, save the
PostScript image in a file with that name.  If FILENAME is t, prompts for a
file name.</p>
<p>
See also documentation for `pr-list-directory'.</p>
<p>
(fn N-UP DIR FILE-REGEXP &optional FILENAME)<a name="increment-register"></a>
<h3>Function: increment-register</h3>
Augment contents of REGISTER.
Interactively, PREFIX is in raw form.</p>
<p>
If REGISTER contains a number, add `prefix-numeric-value' of
PREFIX to it.</p>
<p>
If REGISTER is empty or if it contains text, call
`append-to-register' with `delete-flag' set to PREFIX.<a name="do-after-load-evaluation"></a>
<h3>Function: do-after-load-evaluation</h3>
Evaluate all `eval-after-load' forms, if any, for ABS-FILE.
ABS-FILE, a string, should be the absolute true name of a file just loaded.
This function is called directly from the C code.<a name="face-attributes-as-vector"></a>

<h3>Function: flycheck-syntax-check-interrupt</h3>
Interrupt a SYNTAX-CHECK.<a name="binary-overwrite-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: binary-overwrite-mode</h3>
Toggle Binary Overwrite mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Binary Overwrite mode if ARG
is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,
enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When Binary Overwrite mode is enabled, printing characters typed
in replace existing text.  Newlines are not treated specially, so
typing at the end of a line joins the line to the next, with the
typed character between them.  Typing before a tab character
simply replaces the tab with the character typed.
C-q replaces the text at the cursor, just as
ordinary typing characters do.</p>
<p>
Note that Binary Overwrite mode is not its own minor mode; it is
a specialization of overwrite mode, entered by setting the
`overwrite-mode' variable to `overwrite-mode-binary'.<a name="pr-toggle-file-landscape"></a>
<h3>Function: pr-toggle-file-landscape</h3>
Toggle landscape for PostScript file.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: ediff-merge-directories</h3>
Run Ediff on a pair of directories, DIR1 and DIR2, merging files that have
the same name in both.  The third argument, REGEXP, is nil or a regular
expression; only file names that match the regexp are considered.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: process-mark</h3>
Return the marker for the end of the last output from PROCESS.</p>
<p>
(fn PROCESS)<a name="getenv-internal"></a>
<h3>Function: getenv-internal</h3>
Get the value of environment variable VARIABLE.
VARIABLE should be a string.  Value is nil if VARIABLE is undefined in
the environment.  Otherwise, value is a string.</p>
<p>
This function searches `process-environment' for VARIABLE.</p>
<p>
If optional parameter ENV is a list, then search this list instead of
`process-environment', and return t when encountering a negative entry
(an entry for a variable with no value).</p>
<p>
(fn VARIABLE &optional ENV)<a name="jka-compr-set"></a>
<h3>Function: jka-compr-set</h3>
Internal Custom :set function.<a name="nnfolder-generate-active-file"></a>

<h3>Function: edt-set-scroll-margins</h3>
Set scroll margins.
Argument TOP is the top margin in number of lines or percent of window.
Argument BOTTOM is the bottom margin in number of lines or percent of window.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: customize-saved</h3>
Customize all saved options and faces.<a name="run-mode-hooks"></a>
<h3>Function: run-mode-hooks</h3>
Run mode hooks `delayed-mode-hooks' and HOOKS, or delay HOOKS.
If the variable `delay-mode-hooks' is non-nil, does not run any hooks,
just adds the HOOKS to the list `delayed-mode-hooks'.
Otherwise, runs hooks in the sequence: `change-major-mode-after-body-hook',
`delayed-mode-hooks' (in reverse order), HOOKS, and finally
`after-change-major-mode-hook'.  Major mode functions should use
this instead of `run-hooks' when running their FOO-mode-hook.<a name="user-real-login-name"></a>
<h3>Function: user-real-login-name</h3>
Return the name of the user's real uid, as a string.
This ignores the environment variables LOGNAME and USER, so it differs from
`user-login-name' when running under `su'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="custom-variable-backup-value"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-variable-backup-value</h3>
Back up the current value for WIDGET's variable.
The backup value is kept in the car of the `backup-value' property.<a name="widget-info-link-action"></a>

Open the info node specified by WIDGET.</p>
<p>
(fn WIDGET &optional EVENT)<a name="-value-to-list"></a>
<h3>Function: -value-to-list</h3>
Convert a value to a list.</p>
<p>
If the value is a cons pair, make a list with two elements, `car'
and `cdr' of the pair respectively.</p>
<p>
If the value is anything else, wrap it in a list.</p>
<p>
(fn VAL)<a name="json-encode-list"></a>
<h3>Function: json-encode-list</h3>
Return a JSON representation of LIST.
Tries to DWIM: simple lists become JSON arrays, while alists and plists
become JSON objects.<a name="cl--make-type-test"></a>
<h3>Function: cl--make-type-test</h3></p>
<p>

(fn VAL TYPE)<a name="select-safe-coding-system"></a>
<h3>Function: select-safe-coding-system</h3>
Ask a user to select a safe coding system from candidates.
The candidates of coding systems which can safely encode a text
between FROM and TO are shown in a popup window.  Among them, the most
proper one is suggested as the default.</p>
<p>
The list of `buffer-file-coding-system' of the current buffer, the
default `buffer-file-coding-system', and the most preferred coding
system (if it corresponds to a MIME charset) is treated as the
default coding system list.  Among them, the first one that safely
encodes the text is normally selected silently and returned without
any user interaction.  See also the command `prefer-coding-system'.</p>
<p>
However, the user is queried if the chosen coding system is
inconsistent with what would be selected by `find-auto-coding' from
coding cookies &c. if the contents of the region were read from a
file.  (That could lead to data corruption in a file subsequently
re-visited and edited.)</p>
<p>
Optional 3rd arg DEFAULT-CODING-SYSTEM specifies a coding system or a
list of coding systems to be prepended to the default coding system
list.  However, if DEFAULT-CODING-SYSTEM is a list and the first
element is t, the cdr part is used as the default coding system list,
i.e. current `buffer-file-coding-system', default `buffer-file-coding-system',
and the most preferred coding system are not used.</p>
<p>
Optional 4th arg ACCEPT-DEFAULT-P, if non-nil, is a function to
determine the acceptability of the silently selected coding system.
It is called with that coding system, and should return nil if it
should not be silently selected and thus user interaction is required.</p>
<p>
Optional 5th arg FILE is the file name to use for this purpose.
That is different from `buffer-file-name' when handling `write-region'
(for example).</p>
<p>
The variable `select-safe-coding-system-accept-default-p', if non-nil,
overrides ACCEPT-DEFAULT-P.</p>
<p>
Kludgy feature: if FROM is a string, the string is the target text,
and TO is ignored.<a name="abbrev--write"></a>
<h3>Function: abbrev--write</h3>
Write the abbrev in a `read'able form.
Only writes the non-system abbrevs.
Presumes that `standard-output' points to `current-buffer'.</p>

<h3>Function: custom-theme-visit-theme</h3>
Set up a Custom buffer to edit custom theme THEME.</p>
<p>
(fn THEME)<a name="batch-update-autoloads"></a>
<h3>Function: batch-update-autoloads</h3>
Update loaddefs.el autoloads in batch mode.
Calls `update-directory-autoloads' on the command line arguments.
Definitions are written to `generated-autoload-file' (which
should be non-nil).</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="walk-windows"></a>
<h3>Function: walk-windows</h3>
Cycle through all live windows, calling FUN for each one.
FUN must specify a function with a window as its sole argument.
The optional arguments MINIBUF and ALL-FRAMES specify the set of
windows to include in the walk.</p>
<p>
MINIBUF t means include the minibuffer window even if the
minibuffer is not active.  MINIBUF nil or omitted means include
the minibuffer window only if the minibuffer is active.  Any
other value means do not include the minibuffer window even if
the minibuffer is active.</p>
<p>
ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted means consider all windows on the
selected frame, plus the minibuffer window if specified by the
MINIBUF argument.  If the minibuffer counts, consider all windows
on all frames that share that minibuffer too.  The following
non-nil values of ALL-FRAMES have special meanings:</p>
<p>
- t means consider all windows on all existing frames.</p>
<p>
- `visible' means consider all windows on all visible frames on
  the current terminal.</p>
<p>
- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible
  and iconified frames on the current terminal.</p>
<p>
- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.</p>
<p>
Anything else means consider all windows on the selected frame
and no others.</p>
<p>
This function changes neither the order of recently selected
windows nor the buffer list.<a name="format-insert-file"></a>
<h3>Function: format-insert-file</h3>
Insert the contents of file FILENAME using data format FORMAT.
If FORMAT is nil then do not do any format conversion.
The optional third and fourth arguments BEG and END specify
the part (in bytes) of the file to read.</p>
<p>
The return value is like the value of `insert-file-contents':
a list (ABSOLUTE-FILE-NAME SIZE).<a name="bolp"></a>
<h3>Function: bolp</h3>
Return t if point is at the beginning of a line.</p>
<p>

Apply FUNCTION to each element of SEQUENCE for side effects only.
Unlike `mapcar', don't accumulate the results.  Return SEQUENCE.
SEQUENCE may be a list, a vector, a bool-vector, or a string.</p>
<p>
(fn FUNCTION SEQUENCE)<a name="debugger-setup-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: debugger-setup-buffer</h3>
Initialize the `*Backtrace*' buffer for entry to the debugger.
That buffer should be current already.<a name="window-inside-edges"></a>
<h3>Function: window-inside-edges</h3>
Return a list of the edge coordinates of WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
The returned list has the form (LEFT TOP RIGHT BOTTOM).  TOP and BOTTOM
count by lines, and LEFT and RIGHT count by columns, all relative to 0,
0 at top left corner of frame.</p>
<p>
RIGHT is one more than the rightmost column of WINDOW's text area.
BOTTOM is one more than the bottommost row of WINDOW's text area.  The
inside edges do not include the space used by the WINDOW's scroll bar,
display margins, fringes, header line, and/or mode line.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WINDOW)<a name="float"></a>
<h3>Function: float</h3>
Return the floating point number equal to ARG.</p>
<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="vc-git-stash-show"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-git-stash-show</h3>
Show the contents of stash NAME.</p>
<p>
(fn NAME)<a name="event-apply-meta-modifier"></a>
<h3>Function: event-apply-meta-modifier</h3>
Add the Meta modifier to the following event.
For example, type C-x @ m & to enter Meta-&.<a name="display-message-or-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: display-message-or-buffer</h3>
Display MESSAGE in the echo area if possible, otherwise in a pop-up buffer.
MESSAGE may be either a string or a buffer.</p>
<p>
A buffer is displayed using `display-buffer' if MESSAGE is too long for
the maximum height of the echo area, as defined by `max-mini-window-height'
if `resize-mini-windows' is non-nil.</p>
<p>
Returns either the string shown in the echo area, or when a pop-up
buffer is used, the window used to display it.</p>
<p>
If MESSAGE is a string, then the optional argument BUFFER-NAME is the
name of the buffer used to display it in the case where a pop-up buffer
is used, defaulting to `*Message*'.  In the case where MESSAGE is a
string and it is displayed in the echo area, it is not specified whether
the contents are inserted into the buffer anyway.</p>
<p>
Optional arguments NOT-THIS-WINDOW and FRAME are as for `display-buffer',
and only used if a buffer is displayed.<a name="beginning-of-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: beginning-of-buffer</h3>
Move point to the beginning of the buffer.
With numeric arg N, put point N/10 of the way from the beginning.
If the buffer is narrowed, this command uses the beginning of the
accessible part of the buffer.</p>
<p>
If Transient Mark mode is disabled, leave mark at previous
position, unless a C-u prefix is supplied.</p>
<p>
Don't use this command in Lisp programs!
(goto-char (point-min)) is faster.<a name="sgml-validate"></a>
<h3>Function: sgml-validate</h3>
Validate an SGML document.
Runs COMMAND, a shell command, in a separate process asynchronously
with output going to the buffer `*compilation*'.
You can then use the command C-x ` to find the next error message
and move to the line in the SGML document that caused it.<a name="pr-despool-using-ghostscript"></a>
<h3>Function: pr-despool-using-ghostscript</h3>
Print spooled PostScript using ghostscript.</p>
<p>
Interactively, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the
user for a file name, and saves the spooled PostScript image in that file
instead of sending it to the printer.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, the argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it is nil,
send the image to the printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save the PostScript
image in a file with that name.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FILENAME)<a name="find-function-other-window"></a>
<h3>Function: find-function-other-window</h3>
Find, in another window, the definition of FUNCTION near point.</p>
<p>

Attempt to crack 5x5 using random solutions.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="window-full-width-p"></a>
<h3>Function: window-full-width-p</h3>
Return t if WINDOW is as wide as its containing frame.
More precisely, return t if and only if the total width of WINDOW
equals the total width of the root window of WINDOW's frame.
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.<a name="iso-sgml2iso"></a>
<h3>Function: iso-sgml2iso</h3>
Translate SGML entities in the region to ISO 8859-1 characters.
Use entities from "ISO 8879:1986//ENTITIES Added Latin 1//EN".

<p>
(fn FROM TO &optional BUFFER)<a name="primitive-undo"></a>
<h3>Function: primitive-undo</h3>
Undo N records from the front of the list LIST.
Return what remains of the list.</p>
<p>
(fn N LIST)<a name="html-checkboxes"></a>
<h3>Function: html-checkboxes</h3>
Group of connected checkbox inputs.</p>
<p>
This is a skeleton command (see `skeleton-insert').
Normally the skeleton text is inserted at point, with nothing "inside".
If there is a highlighted region, the skeleton text is wrapped
around the region text.</p>
<p>
A prefix argument ARG says to wrap the skeleton around the next ARG words.
A prefix argument of -1 says to wrap around region, even if not highlighted.
A prefix argument of zero says to wrap around zero words---that is, nothing.
This is a way of overriding the use of a highlighted region.<a name="thing-at-point-looking-at"></a>
<h3>Function: thing-at-point-looking-at</h3>
Return non-nil if point is in or just after a match for REGEXP.
Set the match data from the earliest such match ending at or after
point.<a name="winner-redo"></a>
<h3>Function: winner-redo</h3>
Restore a more recent window configuration saved by Winner mode.<a name="mm-default-file-encoding"></a>
<h3>Function: mm-default-file-encoding</h3>
Return a default encoding for FILE.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE)<a name="hi-lock-line-face-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: hi-lock-line-face-buffer</h3>
Set face of all lines containing a match of REGEXP to FACE.
Interactively, prompt for REGEXP then FACE, using a buffer-local
history list for REGEXP and a global history list for FACE.</p>
<p>
If Font Lock mode is enabled in the buffer, it is used to
highlight REGEXP.  If Font Lock mode is disabled, overlays are
used for highlighting; in this case, the highlighting will not be
updated as you type.</p>
<p>
(fn REGEXP &optional FACE)<a name="coding-system-type"></a>
<h3>Function: coding-system-type</h3>
Return the coding type of CODING-SYSTEM.
A coding type is a symbol indicating the encoding method of CODING-SYSTEM.
See the function `define-coding-system' for more detail.<a name="image-mask-p"></a>
<h3>Function: image-mask-p</h3>
Return t if image SPEC has a mask bitmap.
FRAME is the frame on which the image will be displayed.  FRAME nil
or omitted means use the selected frame.</p>
<p>
(fn SPEC &optional FRAME)<a name="forward-point"></a>
<h3>Function: forward-point</h3>
Return buffer position N characters after (before if N negative) point.</p>
<p>

Check lambda-list LIST for errors.</p>
<p>
(fn LIST)<a name="byte-compile-file-form-with-no-warnings"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-compile-file-form-with-no-warnings</h3></p>
<p>

(fn FORM)<a name="server-process-filter"></a>
<h3>Function: server-process-filter</h3>
Process a request from the server to edit some files.
PROC is the server process.  STRING consists of a sequence of
commands prefixed by a dash.  Some commands have arguments;
these are &-quoted and need to be decoded by `server-unquote-arg'.
The filter parses and executes these commands.</p>
<p>
To illustrate the protocol, here is an example command that
emacsclient sends to create a new X frame (note that the whole
sequence is sent on a single line):</p>
<p>
	-env HOME=/home/lorentey
	-env DISPLAY=:0.0
	... lots of other -env commands
	-display :0.0
	-window-system</p>
<p>
The following commands are accepted by the server:</p>
<p>
`-auth AUTH-STRING'
  Authenticate the client using the secret authentication string
  AUTH-STRING.</p>
<p>
`-env NAME=VALUE'
  An environment variable on the client side.</p>
<p>
`-dir DIRNAME'
  The current working directory of the client process.</p>
<p>
`-current-frame'
  Forbid the creation of new frames.</p>
<p>
`-frame-parameters ALIST'
  Set the parameters of the created frame.</p>
<p>
`-nowait'
  Request that the next frame created should not be
  associated with this client.</p>
<p>
`-display DISPLAY'
  Set the display name to open X frames on.</p>
<p>
`-position LINE[:COLUMN]'
  Go to the given line and column number
  in the next file opened.</p>
<p>
`-file FILENAME'
  Load the given file in the current frame.</p>
<p>
`-eval EXPR'
  Evaluate EXPR as a Lisp expression and return the
  result in -print commands.</p>
<p>
`-window-system'
  Open a new X frame.</p>
<p>
`-tty DEVICENAME TYPE'
  Open a new tty frame at the client.</p>
<p>
`-suspend'
  Suspend this tty frame.  The client sends this string in
  response to SIGTSTP and SIGTTOU.  The server must cease all I/O
  on this tty until it gets a -resume command.</p>
<p>
`-resume'
  Resume this tty frame.  The client sends this string when it
  gets the SIGCONT signal and it is the foreground process on its
  controlling tty.</p>
<p>
`-ignore COMMENT'
  Do nothing, but put the comment in the server log.
  Useful for debugging.</p>
<p>

The following commands are accepted by the client:</p>
<p>
`-emacs-pid PID'
  Describes the process id of the Emacs process;
  used to forward window change signals to it.</p>
<p>
`-window-system-unsupported'
  Signals that the server does not support creating X frames;
  the client must try again with a tty frame.</p>
<p>
`-print STRING'
  Print STRING on stdout.  Used to send values
  returned by -eval.</p>
<p>
`-print-nonl STRING'
  Print STRING on stdout.  Used to continue a
  preceding -print command that would be too big to send
  in a single message.</p>
<p>
`-error DESCRIPTION'
  Signal an error and delete process PROC.</p>
<p>
`-suspend'
  Suspend this terminal, i.e., stop the client process.
  Sent when the user presses C-z.</p>
<p>
(fn PROC STRING)<a name="count-if-not"></a>
<h3>Function: count-if-not</h3>
Count the number of items not satisfying PREDICATE in SEQ.</p>
<p>
Keywords supported:  :key :start :end</p>
<p>
(fn PREDICATE SEQ [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="comment-indent-new-line"></a>
<h3>Function: comment-indent-new-line</h3>
Break line at point and indent, continuing comment if within one.
This indents the body of the continued comment
under the previous comment line.</p>
<p>
This command is intended for styles where you write a comment per line,
starting a new comment (and terminating it if necessary) on each line.
If you want to continue one comment across several lines, use C-j.</p>
<p>
If a fill column is specified, it overrides the use of the comment column
or comment indentation.</p>
<p>
The inserted newline is marked hard if variable `use-hard-newlines' is true,
unless optional argument SOFT is non-nil.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional SOFT)<a name="epa-file-handler"></a>

Insert a symbolic character name according to `sgml-char-names'.<a name="repunctuate-sentences"></a>
<h3>Function: repunctuate-sentences</h3>
Put two spaces at the end of sentences from point to the end of buffer.
It works using `query-replace-regexp'.<a name="syntax-ppss-debug"></a>
<h3>Function: syntax-ppss-debug</h3></p>
<p>

(fn)<a name="url-eat-trailing-space"></a>
<h3>Function: url-eat-trailing-space</h3>
Remove spaces/tabs at the end of a string.<a name="find-tag-noselect"></a>
<h3>Function: find-tag-noselect</h3>
Find tag (in current tags table) whose name contains TAGNAME.
Returns the buffer containing the tag's definition and moves its point there,
but does not select the buffer.
The default for TAGNAME is the expression in the buffer near point.</p>
<p>
If second arg NEXT-P is t (interactively, with prefix arg), search for
another tag that matches the last tagname or regexp used.  When there are
multiple matches for a tag, more exact matches are found first.  If NEXT-P
is the atom `-' (interactively, with prefix arg that is a negative number
or just M--), pop back to the previous tag gone to.</p>
<p>
If third arg REGEXP-P is non-nil, treat TAGNAME as a regexp.</p>
<p>
A marker representing the point when this command is invoked is pushed
onto a ring and may be popped back to with M-*.
Contrast this with the ring of marks gone to by the command.</p>
<p>
See documentation of variable `tags-file-name'.</p>
<p>
(fn TAGNAME &optional NEXT-P REGEXP-P)<a name="edt-emulation-on"></a>
<h3>Function: edt-emulation-on</h3>
Turn on EDT Emulation.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="read-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: read-buffer</h3>
Read the name of a buffer and return as a string.
Prompt with PROMPT.
Optional second arg DEF is value to return if user enters an empty line.
 If DEF is a list of default values, return its first element.
Optional third arg REQUIRE-MATCH determines whether non-existing
 buffer names are allowed.  It has the same meaning as the
 REQUIRE-MATCH argument of `completing-read'.
The argument PROMPT should be a string ending with a colon and a space.
If `read-buffer-completion-ignore-case' is non-nil, completion ignores
case while reading the buffer name.
If `read-buffer-function' is non-nil, this works by calling it as a
function, instead of the usual behavior.</p>
<p>
(fn PROMPT &optional DEF REQUIRE-MATCH)<a name="-is-infix?"></a>
<h3>Function: -is-infix?</h3>
Return non-nil if INFIX is infix of LIST.</p>
<p>

(fn FILE)<a name="window-fringes"></a>
<h3>Function: window-fringes</h3>
Get width of fringes of window WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
Value is a list of the form (LEFT-WIDTH RIGHT-WIDTH OUTSIDE-MARGINS).</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WINDOW)<a name="window-end"></a>
<h3>Function: window-end</h3>
Return position at which display currently ends in WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.
This is updated by redisplay, when it runs to completion.
Simply changing the buffer text or setting `window-start'
does not update this value.
Return nil if there is no recorded value.  (This can happen if the
last redisplay of WINDOW was preempted, and did not finish.)
If UPDATE is non-nil, compute the up-to-date position
if it isn't already recorded.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WINDOW UPDATE)<a name="x-dnd-drop-data"></a>
<h3>Function: x-dnd-drop-data</h3>
Drop one data item onto a frame.
EVENT is the client message for the drop, FRAME is the frame the drop
occurred on.  WINDOW is the window of FRAME where the drop happened.
DATA is the data received from the source, and type is the type for DATA,
see `x-dnd-types-alist').</p>
<p>
Returns the action used (move, copy, link, private) if drop was successful,
nil if not.<a name="beginning-of-defun-raw"></a>
<h3>Function: beginning-of-defun-raw</h3>
Move point to the character that starts a defun.
This is identical to function `beginning-of-defun', except that point
does not move to the beginning of the line when `defun-prompt-regexp'
is non-nil.</p>
<p>
If variable `beginning-of-defun-function' is non-nil, its value
is called as a function to find the defun's beginning.<a name="completion-table-subvert"></a>
<h3>Function: completion-table-subvert</h3>
Return a completion table from TABLE with S1 replaced by S2.
The result is a completion table which completes strings of the
form (concat S1 S) in the same way as TABLE completes strings of
the form (concat S2 S).</p>
<p>
(fn TABLE S1 S2)<a name="print-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: print-buffer</h3>
Paginate and print buffer contents.</p>
<p>
The variable `lpr-headers-switches' controls how to paginate.
If it is nil (the default), we run the `pr' program (or whatever program
`lpr-page-header-program' specifies) to paginate.
`lpr-page-header-switches' specifies the switches for that program.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, the switches in `lpr-headers-switches' are used
in the print command itself; we expect them to request pagination.</p>
<p>
See the variables `lpr-switches' and `lpr-command'
for further customization of the printer command.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="x-server-version"></a>
<h3>Function: x-server-version</h3>
Return the version numbers of the X server of display TERMINAL.
The value is a list of three integers: the major and minor
version numbers of the X Protocol in use, and the distributor-specific release
number.  See also the function `x-server-vendor'.</p>
<p>
The optional argument TERMINAL specifies which display to ask about.
TERMINAL should be a terminal object, a frame or a display name (a string).
If omitted or nil, that stands for the selected frame's display.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional TERMINAL)<a name="<="></a>

<h3>Function: find-lisp-find-dired-subdirectories</h3>
Find all subdirectories of DIR.</p>
<p>
(fn DIR)<a name="yank"></a>
<h3>Function: yank</h3>
Reinsert ("paste") the last stretch of killed text.
More precisely, reinsert the most recent kill, which is the
stretch of killed text most recently killed OR yanked.  Put point
at the end, and set mark at the beginning without activating it.
With just C-u as argument, put point at beginning, and mark at end.
With argument N, reinsert the Nth most recent kill.</p>
<p>
When this command inserts text into the buffer, it honors the
`yank-handled-properties' and `yank-excluded-properties'
variables, and the `yank-handler' text property.  See
`insert-for-yank-1' for details.</p>
<p>
See also the command `yank-pop' (M-y).<a name="format-deannotate-region"></a>
<h3>Function: format-deannotate-region</h3>
Translate annotations in the region into text properties.
This sets text properties between FROM to TO as directed by the
TRANSLATIONS and NEXT-FN arguments.</p>
<p>
NEXT-FN is a function that searches forward from point for an annotation.
It should return a list of 4 elements: (BEGIN END NAME POSITIVE).  BEGIN and
END are buffer positions bounding the annotation, NAME is the name searched
for in TRANSLATIONS, and POSITIVE should be non-nil if this annotation marks
the beginning of a region with some property, or nil if it ends the region.
NEXT-FN should return nil if there are no annotations after point.</p>
<p>
The basic format of the TRANSLATIONS argument is described in the
documentation for the `format-annotate-region' function.  There are some
additional things to keep in mind for decoding, though:</p>
<p>
When an annotation is found, the TRANSLATIONS list is searched for a
text-property name and value that corresponds to that annotation.  If the
text-property has several annotations associated with it, it will be used only
if the other annotations are also in effect at that point.  The first match
found whose annotations are all present is used.</p>
<p>
The text property thus determined is set to the value over the region between
the opening and closing annotations.  However, if the text-property name has a
non-nil `format-list-valued' property, then the value will be consed onto the
surrounding value of the property, rather than replacing that value.</p>
<p>
There are some special symbols that can be used in the "property" slot of
the TRANSLATIONS list: PARAMETER and FUNCTION (spelled in uppercase).
Annotations listed under the pseudo-property PARAMETER are considered to be
arguments of the immediately surrounding annotation; the text between the
opening and closing parameter annotations is deleted from the buffer but saved
as a string.</p>
<p>
The surrounding annotation should be listed under the pseudo-property
FUNCTION.  Instead of inserting a text-property for this annotation,
the function listed in the VALUE slot is called to make whatever
changes are appropriate.  It can also return a list of the form
(START LOC PROP VALUE) which specifies a property to put on.  The
function's first two arguments are the START and END locations, and
the rest of the arguments are any PARAMETERs found in that region.</p>
<p>
Any annotations that are found by NEXT-FN but not defined by TRANSLATIONS
are saved as values of the `unknown' text-property (which is list-valued).
The TRANSLATIONS list should usually contain an entry of the form
    (unknown (nil format-annotate-value))
to write these unknown annotations back into the file.<a name="current-bidi-paragraph-direction"></a>
<h3>Function: current-bidi-paragraph-direction</h3>
Return paragraph direction at point in BUFFER.
Value is either `left-to-right' or `right-to-left'.
If BUFFER is omitted or nil, it defaults to the current buffer.</p>
<p>
Paragraph direction determines how the text in the paragraph is displayed.
In left-to-right paragraphs, text begins at the left margin of the window
and the reading direction is generally left to right.  In right-to-left
paragraphs, text begins at the right margin and is read from right to left.</p>
<p>
See also `bidi-paragraph-direction'.</p>
<p>

(fn CL-NEW CL-OLD CL-TREE)<a name="cl-copy-seq"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-copy-seq</h3>
Return a copy of a list, vector, string or char-table.
The elements of a list or vector are not copied; they are shared
with the original.</p>
<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="vi-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: vi-mode</h3>
Major mode that acts like the `vi' editor.
The purpose of this mode is to provide you the combined power of vi (namely,
the "cross product" effect of commands and repeat last changes) and Emacs.</p>
<p>
This command redefines nearly all keys to look like vi commands.
It records the previous major mode, and any vi command for input
(`i', `a', `s', etc.) switches back to that mode.
Thus, ordinary Emacs (in whatever major mode you had been using)
is "input" mode as far as vi is concerned.</p>
<p>
To get back into vi from "input" mode, you must issue this command again.
Therefore, it is recommended that you assign it to a key.</p>
<p>
Major differences between this mode and real vi :</p>
<p>
* Limitations and unsupported features
  - Search patterns with line offset (e.g. /pat/+3 or /pat/z.) are
    not supported.
  - Ex commands are not implemented; try ':' to get some hints.
  - No line undo (i.e. the 'U' command), but multi-undo is a standard feature.</p>
<p>
* Modifications
  - The stopping positions for some point motion commands (word boundary,
    pattern search) are slightly different from standard 'vi'.
    Also, no automatic wrap around at end of buffer for pattern searching.
  - Since changes are done in two steps (deletion then insertion), you need
    to undo twice to completely undo a change command.  But this is not needed
    for undoing a repeated change command.
  - No need to set/unset 'magic', to search for a string with regular expr
    in it just put a prefix arg for the search commands.  Replace cmds too.
  - ^R is bound to incremental backward search, so use ^L to redraw screen.</p>
<p>
* Extensions
  - Some standard (or modified) Emacs commands were integrated, such as
    incremental search, query replace, transpose objects, and keyboard macros.
  - In command state, ^X links to the 'ctl-x-map', and ESC can be linked to
    esc-map or set undefined.  These can give you the full power of Emacs.
  - See vi-com-map for those keys that are extensions to standard vi, e.g.
    `vi-name-last-change-or-macro', `vi-verify-spelling', `vi-locate-def',
    `vi-mark-region', and 'vi-quote-words'.  Some of them are quite handy.
  - Use M-x vi-switch-mode to switch among different modes quickly.</p>

(fn)<a name="window--resize-root-window-vertically"></a>
<h3>Function: window--resize-root-window-vertically</h3>
Resize root window WINDOW vertically by DELTA lines.
If DELTA is less than zero and we can't shrink WINDOW by DELTA
lines, shrink it as much as possible.  If DELTA is greater than
zero, this function can resize fixed-size windows in order to
recover the necessary lines.</p>
<p>
Return the number of lines that were recovered.</p>
<p>
This function is only called by the minibuffer window resizing
routines.  It resizes windows proportionally and never deletes
any windows.<a name="member"></a>
<h3>Function: member</h3>
Return non-nil if ELT is an element of LIST.  Comparison done with `equal'.
The value is actually the tail of LIST whose car is ELT.</p>
<p>

notation.
FROM (or 0 if nil) gives the mode bits on which to base permissions if
MODES request to add, remove, or set permissions based on existing ones,
as in "og+rX-w".<a name="unlock-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: unlock-buffer</h3>
Unlock the file visited in the current buffer.
If the buffer is not modified, this does nothing because the file
should not be locked in that case.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="downcase"></a>
<h3>Function: downcase</h3>

<h3>Function: eval-defun-2</h3>
Evaluate defun that point is in or before.
The value is displayed in the minibuffer.
If the current defun is actually a call to `defvar',
then reset the variable using the initial value expression
even if the variable already has some other value.
(Normally `defvar' does not change the variable's value
if it already has a value.)</p>
<p>
With argument, insert value in current buffer after the defun.
Return the result of evaluation.<a name="completion-pcm--prepare-delim-re"></a>
<h3>Function: completion-pcm--prepare-delim-re</h3></p>

server for future sessions.</p>
<p>
(fn SERVER PROTOCOL &optional NO-SAVE)<a name="previous-window"></a>
<h3>Function: previous-window</h3>
Return live window before WINDOW in the cyclic ordering of windows.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.  The
optional arguments MINIBUF and ALL-FRAMES specify the set of windows to
consider.</p>
<p>
MINIBUF nil or omitted means consider the minibuffer window only if the
minibuffer is active.  MINIBUF t means consider the minibuffer window
even if the minibuffer is not active.  Any other value means do not
consider the minibuffer window even if the minibuffer is active.</p>
<p>
ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted means consider all windows on WINDOW's frame,
plus the minibuffer window if specified by the MINIBUF argument.  If the
minibuffer counts, consider all windows on all frames that share that
minibuffer too.  The following non-nil values of ALL-FRAMES have special
meanings:</p>
<p>
- t means consider all windows on all existing frames.</p>
<p>
- `visible' means consider all windows on all visible frames.</p>
<p>
- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible and
  iconified frames.</p>
<p>
- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.</p>
<p>
Anything else means consider all windows on WINDOW's frame and no
others.</p>
<p>
If you use consistent values for MINIBUF and ALL-FRAMES, you can
use `previous-window' to iterate through the entire cycle of
acceptable windows, eventually ending up back at the window you
started with.  `next-window' traverses the same cycle, in the
reverse order.</p>

list is empty).</p>
<p>
(fn COMMAND-ARGS)<a name="expand-add-abbrevs"></a>
<h3>Function: expand-add-abbrevs</h3>
Add a list of abbreviations to abbrev table TABLE.
ABBREVS is a list of abbrev definitions; each abbrev description entry
has the form (ABBREV EXPANSION ARG).</p>
<p>
ABBREV is the abbreviation to replace.</p>
<p>
EXPANSION is the replacement string or a function which will make the
expansion.  For example, you could use the DMacros or skeleton packages
to generate such functions.</p>

ARG is an optional argument which can be a number or a list of
numbers.  If ARG is a number, point is placed ARG chars from the
beginning of the expanded text.</p>
<p>
If ARG is a list of numbers, point is placed according to the first
member of the list, but you can visit the other specified positions
cyclically with the functions `expand-jump-to-previous-slot' and
`expand-jump-to-next-slot'.</p>
<p>
If ARG is omitted, point is placed at the end of the expanded text.</p>
<p>
(fn TABLE ABBREVS)<a name="emacs-bzr-get-version"></a>
<h3>Function: emacs-bzr-get-version</h3>
Try to return as a string the bzr revision of the Emacs sources.
The format is: [revno] revision_id, where revno may be absent.
Value is nil if the sources do not seem to be under bzr, or if we could
not determine the revision.  Note that this reports on the current state
of the sources, which may not correspond to the running Emacs.</p>
<p>
Optional argument DIR is a directory to use instead of `source-directory'.
Optional argument EXTERNAL non-nil means to maybe ask `bzr' itself,
if the sources appear to be under bzr.  If `force', always ask bzr.

The optional argument FRAME must be a live frame and defaults to
the selected one.</p>
<p>
If FRAME has at least one side window, the major non-side window
is either an internal non-side window such that all other
non-side windows on FRAME descend from it, or the single live
non-side window of FRAME.  If FRAME has no side windows, return
its root window.<a name="process-send-region"></a>
<h3>Function: process-send-region</h3>
Send current contents of region as input to PROCESS.
PROCESS may be a process, a buffer, the name of a process or buffer, or
nil, indicating the current buffer's process.

(WIDTH HEIGHT DATA) where WIDTH is the pixel width of the bitmap,
HEIGHT is its height, and DATA is a string containing the bits of
the pixmap.  Bits are stored row by row, each row occupies
(WIDTH + 7)/8 bytes.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT)<a name="diff-write-contents-hooks"></a>
<h3>Function: diff-write-contents-hooks</h3>
Fixup hunk headers if necessary.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="Info-goto-node"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-goto-node</h3>
Go to Info node named NODENAME.  Give just NODENAME or (FILENAME)NODENAME.
If NODENAME is of the form (FILENAME)NODENAME, the node is in the Info file
FILENAME; otherwise, NODENAME should be in the current Info file (or one of
its sub-files).
Completion is available, but only for node names in the current Info file.
If FORK is non-nil (interactively with a prefix arg), show the node in
a new Info buffer.
If FORK is a string, it is the name to use for the new buffer.<a name="vip-setup"></a>

<h3>Function: insert-file-contents-literally</h3>
Like `insert-file-contents', but only reads in the file literally.
A buffer may be modified in several ways after reading into the buffer,
to Emacs features such as format decoding, character code
conversion, `find-file-hook', automatic uncompression, etc.</p>
<p>
This function ensures that none of these modifications will take place.<a name="x-select-font"></a>
<h3>Function: x-select-font</h3>
Read a font using a GTK dialog.
Return either a font spec (for GTK versions >= 3.2) or a string
containing a GTK-style font name.</p>

and does not employ any heuristic at all.<a name="face-remap-add-relative"></a>
<h3>Function: face-remap-add-relative</h3>
Add a face remapping entry of FACE to SPECS in the current buffer.
Return a cookie which can be used to delete this remapping with
`face-remap-remove-relative'.</p>
<p>
The remaining arguments, SPECS, should form a list of faces.
Each list element should be either a face name or a property list
of face attribute/value pairs.  If more than one face is listed,
that specifies an aggregate face, in the same way as in a `face'
text property, except for possible priority changes noted below.</p>
<p>
The face remapping specified by SPECS takes effect alongside the
remappings from other calls to `face-remap-add-relative' for the
same FACE, as well as the normal definition of FACE (at lowest
priority).  This function tries to sort multiple remappings for
the same face, so that remappings specifying relative face
attributes are applied after remappings specifying absolute face
attributes.</p>
<p>
The base (lowest priority) remapping may be set to something
other than the normal definition of FACE via `face-remap-set-base'.</p>
<p>
(fn FACE &rest SPECS)<a name="tty-color-values"></a>
<h3>Function: tty-color-values</h3>
Return RGB values of the color COLOR on a termcap frame FRAME.</p>

as a sequence of words without regard to how the words are separated.
See the command `isearch-forward' for more information.<a name="make-symbolic-link"></a>
<h3>Function: make-symbolic-link</h3>
Make a symbolic link to FILENAME, named LINKNAME.
Both args must be strings.
Signals a `file-already-exists' error if a file LINKNAME already exists
unless optional third argument OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS is non-nil.
A number as third arg means request confirmation if LINKNAME already exists.
This happens for interactive use with M-x.</p>

<h3>Function: edit-kbd-macro</h3>
Edit a keyboard macro.
At the prompt, type any key sequence which is bound to a keyboard macro.
Or, type `C-x e' or RET to edit the last keyboard macro, `C-h l' to edit
the last 300 keystrokes as a keyboard macro, or `M-x' to edit a macro by
its command name.
With a prefix argument, format the macro in a more concise way.<a name="window--display-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: window--display-buffer</h3>
Display BUFFER in WINDOW.
TYPE must be one of the symbols `reuse', `window' or `frame' and
is passed unaltered to `display-buffer-record-window'.  ALIST is
the alist argument of `display-buffer'.  Set `window-dedicated-p'
to DEDICATED if non-nil.  Return WINDOW if BUFFER and WINDOW are
live.<a name="flycheck-overlay-errors-at"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-overlay-errors-at</h3>
Return a list of all flycheck errors overlayed at POS.<a name="mailcap-extension-to-mime"></a>

<h3>Function: help-make-xrefs</h3>
Parse and hyperlink documentation cross-references in the given BUFFER.</p>
<p>
Find cross-reference information in a buffer and activate such cross
references for selection with `help-follow'.  Cross-references have
the canonical form `...'  and the type of reference may be
disambiguated by the preceding word(s) used in
`help-xref-symbol-regexp'.  Faces only get cross-referenced if
preceded or followed by the word `face'.  Variables without
variable documentation do not get cross-referenced, unless
preceded by the word `variable' or `option'.</p>
<p>
If the variable `help-xref-mule-regexp' is non-nil, find also
cross-reference information related to multilingual environment
(e.g., coding-systems).  This variable is also used to disambiguate
the type of reference as the same way as `help-xref-symbol-regexp'.</p>
<p>
A special reference `back' is made to return back through a stack of
help buffers.  Variable `help-back-label' specifies the text for
that.<a name="face-attr-construct"></a>
<h3>Function: face-attr-construct</h3>
Return a `defface'-style attribute list for FACE.

Return (PRED x) for the first LIST item where (PRED x) is non-nil, else nil.</p>
<p>
Alias: `-any'</p>
<p>
(fn PRED LIST)<a name="advertised-undo"></a>
<h3>Function: advertised-undo</h3>
Undo some previous changes.
Repeat this command to undo more changes.
A numeric ARG serves as a repeat count.</p>
<p>
In Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, only undo changes within
the current region.  Similarly, when not in Transient Mark mode, just C-u
as an argument limits undo to changes within the current region.<a name="erc-ezb-add-session"></a>
<h3>Function: erc-ezb-add-session</h3>
Add an EZBounce session to the session list.</p>
<p>
(fn MESSAGE)<a name="bs-cycle-next"></a>
<h3>Function: bs-cycle-next</h3>
Select next buffer defined by buffer cycling.
The buffers taking part in buffer cycling are defined
by buffer configuration `bs-cycle-configuration-name'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="yank-handle-font-lock-face-property"></a>
<h3>Function: yank-handle-font-lock-face-property</h3>
If `font-lock-defaults' is nil, apply FACE as a `face' property.
START and END denote the start and end of the text to act on.
Do nothing if FACE is nil.<a name="profiler-memory-running-p"></a>
<h3>Function: profiler-memory-running-p</h3>
Return non-nil if memory profiler is running.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="window-use-time"></a>
<h3>Function: window-use-time</h3>
Return the use time of window WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.
The window with the highest use time is the most recently selected
one.  The window with the lowest use time is the least recently
selected one.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WINDOW)<a name="load"></a>
<h3>Function: load</h3>
Execute a file of Lisp code named FILE.
First try FILE with `.elc' appended, then try with `.el',
then try FILE unmodified (the exact suffixes in the exact order are
determined by `load-suffixes').  Environment variable references in
FILE are replaced with their values by calling `substitute-in-file-name'.
This function searches the directories in `load-path'.</p>
<p>
If optional second arg NOERROR is non-nil,
report no error if FILE doesn't exist.
Print messages at start and end of loading unless
optional third arg NOMESSAGE is non-nil (but `force-load-messages'
overrides that).
If optional fourth arg NOSUFFIX is non-nil, don't try adding
suffixes `.elc' or `.el' to the specified name FILE.
If optional fifth arg MUST-SUFFIX is non-nil, insist on
the suffix `.elc' or `.el'; don't accept just FILE unless
it ends in one of those suffixes or includes a directory name.</p>
<p>
If NOSUFFIX is nil, then if a file could not be found, try looking for
a different representation of the file by adding non-empty suffixes to
its name, before trying another file.  Emacs uses this feature to find
compressed versions of files when Auto Compression mode is enabled.
If NOSUFFIX is non-nil, disable this feature.</p>
<p>
The suffixes that this function tries out, when NOSUFFIX is nil, are
given by the return value of `get-load-suffixes' and the values listed
in `load-file-rep-suffixes'.  If MUST-SUFFIX is non-nil, only the
return value of `get-load-suffixes' is used, i.e. the file name is
required to have a non-empty suffix.</p>
<p>
Loading a file records its definitions, and its `provide' and
`require' calls, in an element of `load-history' whose
car is the file name loaded.  See `load-history'.</p>
<p>
While the file is in the process of being loaded, the variable
`load-in-progress' is non-nil and the variable `load-file-name'
is bound to the file's name.</p>
<p>
Return t if the file exists and loads successfully.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE &optional NOERROR NOMESSAGE NOSUFFIX MUST-SUFFIX)<a name="file-accessible-directory-p"></a>
<h3>Function: file-accessible-directory-p</h3>
Return t if file FILENAME names a directory you can open.
For the value to be t, FILENAME must specify the name of a directory as a file,
and the directory must allow you to open files in it.  In order to use a
directory as a buffer's current directory, this predicate must return true.
A directory name spec may be given instead; then the value is t
if the directory so specified exists and really is a readable and
searchable directory.</p>
<p>
(fn FILENAME)<a name="emacs-lisp-byte-compile"></a>
<h3>Function: emacs-lisp-byte-compile</h3>
Byte compile the file containing the current buffer.<a name="bug-reference-prog-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: bug-reference-prog-mode</h3>
Like `bug-reference-mode', but only buttonize in comments and strings.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="stable-sort"></a>
<h3>Function: stable-sort</h3>
Sort the argument SEQ stably according to PREDICATE.
This is a destructive function; it reuses the storage of SEQ if possible.</p>
<p>
Keywords supported:  :key</p>
<p>
(fn SEQ PREDICATE [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="decrease-left-margin"></a>
<h3>Function: decrease-left-margin</h3>
Make the left margin of the region smaller.
With no prefix argument, decrease the indentation by `standard-indent'.
A prefix arg (optional third arg INC noninteractively) specifies the amount
to change the margin by, in characters.
If `auto-fill-mode' is active, re-fill the region to fit the new margin.<a name="store-substring"></a>
<h3>Function: store-substring</h3>
Embed OBJ (string or character) at index IDX of STRING.<a name="with-no-warnings"></a>
<h3>Function: with-no-warnings</h3>
Like `progn', but prevents compiler warnings in the body.</p>
<p>
(fn &rest BODY)<a name="directory-files-and-attributes"></a>
<h3>Function: directory-files-and-attributes</h3>
Return a list of names of files and their attributes in DIRECTORY.
There are four optional arguments:
If FULL is non-nil, return absolute file names.  Otherwise return names
 that are relative to the specified directory.
If MATCH is non-nil, mention only file names that match the regexp MATCH.
If NOSORT is non-nil, the list is not sorted--its order is unpredictable.
 NOSORT is useful if you plan to sort the result yourself.
ID-FORMAT specifies the preferred format of attributes uid and gid, see
`file-attributes' for further documentation.
On MS-Windows, performance depends on `w32-get-true-file-attributes',
which see.</p>
<p>
(fn DIRECTORY &optional FULL MATCH NOSORT ID-FORMAT)<a name="custom-browse-insert-prefix"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-browse-insert-prefix</h3>
Insert PREFIX.  On XEmacs convert it to line graphics.<a name="flycheck-define-command-checker"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-define-command-checker</h3>
Define SYMBOL as syntax checker to run a command.</p>
<p>
Define SYMBOL as generic syntax checker via
`flycheck-define-generic-checker', which uses an external command
to check the buffer.  SYMBOL and DOCSTRING are the same as for
`flycheck-define-generic-checker'.</p>
<p>
In addition to the properties understood by
`flycheck-define-generic-checker', the following PROPERTIES
constitute a command syntax checker.  Unless otherwise noted, all
properties are mandatory.  Note that the default `:error-filter'
of command checkers is `flycheck-sanitize-errors'.</p>
<p>
`:command COMMAND'
     The command to run for syntax checking.</p>
<p>
     COMMAND is a list of the form `(EXECUTABLE [ARG ...])'.</p>
<p>
     EXECUTABLE is a string with the executable of this syntax
     checker.  It can be overridden with the variable
     `flycheck-SYMBOL-executable'.  Note that this variable is
     NOT implicitly defined by this function.  Use
     `flycheck-def-executable-var' to define this variable.</p>
<p>
     Each ARG is an argument to the executable, either as string,
     or as special symbol or form for
     `flycheck-substitute-argument', which see.</p>
<p>
`:error-patterns PATTERNS'
     A list of patterns to parse the output of the `:command'.</p>
<p>
     Each ITEM in PATTERNS is a list `(LEVEL SEXP ...)', where
     LEVEL is a Flycheck error level (see
     `flycheck-define-error-level'), followed by one or more RX
     `SEXP's which parse an error of that level and extract line,
     column, file name and the message.</p>
<p>
     See `rx' for general information about RX, and
     `flycheck-rx-to-string' for some special RX forms provided
     by Flycheck.</p>
<p>
     All patterns are applied in the order of declaration to the
     whole output of the syntax checker.  Output already matched
     by a pattern will not be matched by subsequent patterns.  In
     other words, the first pattern wins.</p>
<p>
     This property is optional.  If omitted, however, an
     `:error-parser' is mandatory.</p>
<p>
`:error-parser FUNCTION'
     A function to parse errors with.</p>
<p>
     The function shall accept three arguments OUTPUT CHECKER
     BUFFER.  OUTPUT is the syntax checker output as string,
     CHECKER the syntax checker that was used, and BUFFER a
     buffer object representing the checked buffer.  The function
     must return a list of `flycheck-error' objects parsed from
     OUTPUT.</p>
<p>
     This property is optional.  If omitted, it defaults to
     `flycheck-parse-with-patterns'.  In this case,
     `:error-patterns' is mandatory.</p>
<p>
`:standard-input t'
     Whether to send the buffer contents on standard input.</p>
<p>
     If this property is given and has a non-nil value, send the
     contents of the buffer on standard input.</p>
<p>
     Defaults to nil.</p>
<p>
Note that you may not give `:start', `:interrupt', and
`:print-doc' for a command checker.  You can give a custom
`:verify' function, though, whose results will be appended to the
default `:verify' function of command checkers.<a name="dired-do-isearch-regexp"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-do-isearch-regexp</h3>
Search for a regexp through all marked files using Isearch.<a name="customize-mark-to-save"></a>
<h3>Function: customize-mark-to-save</h3>
Mark SYMBOL for later saving.</p>
<p>
If the default value of SYMBOL is different from the standard value,
set the `saved-value' property to a list whose car evaluates to the
default value.  Otherwise, set it to nil.</p>
<p>
To actually save the value, call `custom-save-all'.</p>
<p>
Return non-nil if the `saved-value' property actually changed.<a name="run-with-timer"></a>
<h3>Function: run-with-timer</h3>
Perform an action after a delay of SECS seconds.
Repeat the action every REPEAT seconds, if REPEAT is non-nil.
SECS and REPEAT may be integers or floating point numbers.
The action is to call FUNCTION with arguments ARGS.</p>
<p>
This function returns a timer object which you can use in `cancel-timer'.<a name="keymapp"></a>
<h3>Function: keymapp</h3>
Return t if OBJECT is a keymap.</p>
<p>
A keymap is a list (keymap . ALIST),
or a symbol whose function definition is itself a keymap.
ALIST elements look like (CHAR . DEFN) or (SYMBOL . DEFN);
a vector of densely packed bindings for small character codes
is also allowed as an element.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT)<a name="sgml-empty-tag-p"></a>
<h3>Function: sgml-empty-tag-p</h3>
Return non-nil if TAG-NAME is an implicitly empty tag.<a name="cl-maphash"></a>

<p>
(fn)<a name="quail-update-leim-list-file"></a>
<h3>Function: quail-update-leim-list-file</h3>
Update entries for Quail packages in `LEIM' list file in directory DIRNAME.
DIRNAME is a directory containing Emacs input methods;
normally, it should specify the `leim' subdirectory
of the Emacs source tree.</p>
<p>
It searches for Quail packages under `quail' subdirectory of DIRNAME,
and update the file "leim-list.el" in DIRNAME.</p>
<p>
When called from a program, the remaining arguments are additional
directory names to search for Quail packages under `quail' subdirectory
of each directory.</p>
<p>
(fn DIRNAME &rest DIRNAMES)<a name="fancy-about-screen"></a>
<h3>Function: fancy-about-screen</h3>
Display fancy About screen.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="set-face-foreground"></a>
<h3>Function: set-face-foreground</h3>
Change the foreground color of face FACE to COLOR (a string).
FRAME nil or not specified means change face on all frames.
COLOR can be a system-defined color name (see `list-colors-display')
or a hex spec of the form #RRGGBB.
When called interactively, prompts for the face and color.<a name="unify-charset"></a>
<h3>Function: unify-charset</h3>
Unify characters of CHARSET with Unicode.
This means reading the relevant file and installing the table defined
by CHARSET's `:unify-map' property.</p>
<p>
Optional second arg UNIFY-MAP is a file name string or a vector.  It has
the same meaning as the `:unify-map' attribute in the function
`define-charset' (which see).</p>
<p>
Optional third argument DEUNIFY, if non-nil, means to de-unify CHARSET.</p>
<p>
(fn CHARSET &optional UNIFY-MAP DEUNIFY)<a name="gnus-invisible-p"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-invisible-p</h3>
Non-nil if the property makes the text invisible.
POS-OR-PROP can be a marker or number, in which case it is taken to be
a position in the current buffer and the value of the `invisible' property
is checked; or it can be some other value, which is then presumed to be the
value of the `invisible' property of the text of interest.
The non-nil value returned can be t for truly invisible text or something
else if the text is replaced by an ellipsis.</p>
<p>
(fn POS-OR-PROP)<a name="Info-read-node-name"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-read-node-name</h3>
Read an Info node name with completion, prompting with PROMPT.
A node name can have the form "NODENAME", referring to a node
in the current Info file, or "(FILENAME)NODENAME".<a name="insert-pair"></a>
<h3>Function: insert-pair</h3>
Enclose following ARG sexps in a pair of OPEN and CLOSE characters.
Leave point after the first character.
A negative ARG encloses the preceding ARG sexps instead.
No argument is equivalent to zero: just insert characters
and leave point between.
If `parens-require-spaces' is non-nil, this command also inserts a space
before and after, depending on the surrounding characters.
If region is active, insert enclosing characters at region boundaries.</p>
<p>
If arguments OPEN and CLOSE are nil, the character pair is found
from the variable `insert-pair-alist' according to the last input
character with or without modifiers.  If no character pair is
found in the variable `insert-pair-alist', then the last input
character is inserted ARG times.</p>
<p>
This command assumes point is not in a string or comment.<a name="isearch-toggle-symbol"></a>
<h3>Function: isearch-toggle-symbol</h3>
Toggle symbol searching on or off.<a name="find-name-dired"></a>
<h3>Function: find-name-dired</h3>
Search DIR recursively for files matching the globbing pattern PATTERN,
and run dired on those files.
PATTERN is a shell wildcard (not an Emacs regexp) and need not be quoted.
The command run (after changing into DIR) is</p>
<p>
    find . -name 'PATTERN' -ls</p>
<p>
(fn DIR PATTERN)<a name="set-syntax-table"></a>
<h3>Function: set-syntax-table</h3>
Select a new syntax table for the current buffer.
One argument, a syntax table.</p>
<p>
(fn TABLE)<a name="current-time-string"></a>
<h3>Function: current-time-string</h3>
Return the current local time, as a human-readable string.
Programs can use this function to decode a time,
since the number of columns in each field is fixed
if the year is in the range 1000-9999.
The format is `Sun Sep 16 01:03:52 1973'.
However, see also the functions `decode-time' and `format-time-string'
which provide a much more powerful and general facility.</p>
<p>
If SPECIFIED-TIME is given, it is a time to format instead of the
current time.  The argument should have the form (HIGH LOW . IGNORED).
Thus, you can use times obtained from `current-time' and from
`file-attributes'.  SPECIFIED-TIME can also have the form (HIGH . LOW),
but this is considered obsolete.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional SPECIFIED-TIME)<a name="Custom-mode-menu"></a>
<h3>Function: Custom-mode-menu</h3>
Menu used in customization buffers.<a name="ert--pp-with-indentation-and-newline"></a>

Ensures a final newline is inserted.<a name="completion-table-with-quoting"></a>
<h3>Function: completion-table-with-quoting</h3>
Return a new completion table operating on quoted text.
TABLE operates on the unquoted text.
UNQUOTE is a function that takes a string and returns a new unquoted string.
REQUOTE is a function of 2 args (UPOS QSTR) where
  QSTR is a string entered by the user (and hence indicating
  the user's preferred form of quoting); and
  UPOS is a position within the unquoted form of QSTR.
REQUOTE should return a pair (QPOS . QFUN) such that QPOS is the
position corresponding to UPOS but in QSTR, and QFUN is a function
of one argument (a string) which returns that argument appropriately quoted
for use at QPOS.</p>
<p>
(fn TABLE UNQUOTE REQUOTE)<a name="point"></a>
<h3>Function: point</h3>
Return value of point, as an integer.
Beginning of buffer is position (point-min).</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="listp"></a>
<h3>Function: listp</h3>
Return t if OBJECT is a list, that is, a cons cell or nil.
Otherwise, return nil.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT)<a name="custom-variable-documentation"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-variable-documentation</h3>
Return documentation of VARIABLE for use in Custom buffer.
Normally just return the docstring.  But if VARIABLE automatically
becomes buffer local when set, append a message to that effect.<a name="compilation-buffer-p"></a>
<h3>Function: compilation-buffer-p</h3>
Test if BUFFER is a compilation buffer.<a name="ietf-drums-get-comment"></a>
<h3>Function: ietf-drums-get-comment</h3>
Return the first comment in STRING.<a name="menu-bar-open"></a>
<h3>Function: menu-bar-open</h3>
Start key navigation of the menu bar in FRAME.</p>
<p>
This function decides which method to use to access the menu
depending on FRAME's terminal device.  On X displays, it calls
`x-menu-bar-open'; on Windows, `w32-menu-bar-open' otherwise it
calls `tmm-menubar'.</p>
<p>
If FRAME is nil or not given, use the selected frame.<a name="pr-ps-directory-print"></a>
<h3>Function: pr-ps-directory-print</h3>
Print directory using PostScript printer.</p>
<p>
Interactively, the command prompts for N-UP printing number, a directory, a
file name regexp for matching and, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the
command prompts the user for a file name, and saves the PostScript image in
that file instead of saving it in a temporary file.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, if N-UP is nil, prompts for N-UP printing number.  If DIR is
nil, prompts for DIRectory.  If FILE-REGEXP is nil, prompts for
FILE(name)-REGEXP.  The argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it's nil,
save the image in a temporary file.  If FILENAME is a string, save the
PostScript image in a file with that name.  If FILENAME is t, prompts for a
file name.</p>
<p>
See also documentation for `pr-list-directory'.</p>
<p>
(fn N-UP DIR FILE-REGEXP &optional FILENAME)<a name="js-mode"></a>

Return the position at which OVERLAY starts.</p>
<p>
(fn OVERLAY)<a name="make-sparse-keymap"></a>
<h3>Function: make-sparse-keymap</h3>
Construct and return a new sparse keymap.
Its car is `keymap' and its cdr is an alist of (CHAR . DEFINITION),
which binds the character CHAR to DEFINITION, or (SYMBOL . DEFINITION),
which binds the function key or mouse event SYMBOL to DEFINITION.
Initially the alist is nil.</p>
<p>
The optional arg STRING supplies a menu name for the keymap
in case you use it as a menu with `x-popup-menu'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional STRING)<a name="eieio-barf-if-slot-unbound"></a>
<h3>Function: eieio-barf-if-slot-unbound</h3>
Throw a signal if VALUE is a representation of an UNBOUND slot.
INSTANCE is the object being referenced.  SLOTNAME is the offending
slot.  If the slot is ok, return VALUE.
Argument FN is the function calling this verifier.<a name="easy-menu-filter-return"></a>
<h3>Function: easy-menu-filter-return</h3>
Convert MENU to the right thing to return from a menu filter.
MENU is a menu as computed by `easy-menu-define' or `easy-menu-create-menu' or
a symbol whose value is such a menu.
In Emacs a menu filter must return a menu (a keymap), in XEmacs a filter must
return a menu items list (without menu name and keywords).
This function returns the right thing in the two cases.
If NAME is provided, it is used for the keymap.<a name="set-default"></a>
<h3>Function: set-default</h3>
Set SYMBOL's default value to VALUE.  SYMBOL and VALUE are evaluated.
The default value is seen in buffers that do not have their own values
for this variable.</p>

<p>
(fn X &optional SIZE)<a name="font-lock-append-text-property"></a>
<h3>Function: font-lock-append-text-property</h3>
Append to one property of the text from START to END.
Arguments PROP and VALUE specify the property and value to append to the value
already in place.  The resulting property values are always lists.
Optional argument OBJECT is the string or buffer containing the text.<a name="gravatar-retrieve-synchronously"></a>
<h3>Function: gravatar-retrieve-synchronously</h3>
Retrieve MAIL-ADDRESS gravatar and returns it.</p>
<p>
(fn MAIL-ADDRESS)<a name="find-tag-regexp"></a>
<h3>Function: find-tag-regexp</h3>
Find tag (in current tags table) whose name matches REGEXP.
Select the buffer containing the tag's definition and move point there.</p>
<p>
If second arg NEXT-P is t (interactively, with prefix arg), search for
another tag that matches the last tagname or regexp used.  When there are
multiple matches for a tag, more exact matches are found first.  If NEXT-P
is negative (interactively, with prefix arg that is a negative number or
just M--), pop back to the previous tag gone to.</p>
<p>
If third arg OTHER-WINDOW is non-nil, select the buffer in another window.</p>
<p>
A marker representing the point when this command is invoked is pushed
onto a ring and may be popped back to with M-*.
Contrast this with the ring of marks gone to by the command.</p>
<p>
See documentation of variable `tags-file-name'.</p>
<p>
(fn REGEXP &optional NEXT-P OTHER-WINDOW)<a name="erc-ezb-init-session-list"></a>
<h3>Function: erc-ezb-init-session-list</h3>
Reset the EZBounce session list to nil.</p>
<p>
(fn MESSAGE)<a name="epa-global-mail-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: epa-global-mail-mode</h3>
Minor mode to hook EasyPG into Mail mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable the mode if ARG is positive,
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode
if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="tty-create-frame-with-faces"></a>
<h3>Function: tty-create-frame-with-faces</h3>
Create and return a frame from optional frame parameters PARAMETERS.
If PARAMETERS contains a `reverse' parameter, handle that.<a name="save-buffers-kill-emacs"></a>
<h3>Function: save-buffers-kill-emacs</h3>
Offer to save each buffer, then kill this Emacs process.
With prefix ARG, silently save all file-visiting buffers without asking.
If there are active processes where `process-query-on-exit-flag'
returns non-nil, asks whether processes should be killed.
Runs the members of `kill-emacs-query-functions' in turn and stops
if any returns nil.  If `confirm-kill-emacs' is non-nil, calls it.<a name="auto-coding-regexp-alist-lookup"></a>
<h3>Function: auto-coding-regexp-alist-lookup</h3>
Lookup `auto-coding-regexp-alist' for the contents of the current buffer.
The value is a coding system is specified for the region FROM and TO,
or nil.<a name="fill-individual-paragraphs"></a>
<h3>Function: fill-individual-paragraphs</h3>
Fill paragraphs of uniform indentation within the region.
This command divides the region into "paragraphs",
treating every change in indentation level or prefix as a paragraph boundary,
then fills each paragraph using its indentation level as the fill prefix.</p>
<p>
There is one special case where a change in indentation does not start
a new paragraph.  This is for text of this form:</p>
<p>
   foo>    This line with extra indentation starts
   foo> a paragraph that continues on more lines.</p>
<p>
These lines are filled together.</p>
<p>
When calling from a program, pass the range to fill
as the first two arguments.</p>
<p>
Optional third and fourth arguments JUSTIFY and CITATION-REGEXP:
JUSTIFY to justify paragraphs (prefix arg).
When filling a mail message, pass a regexp for CITATION-REGEXP
which will match the prefix of a line which is a citation marker
plus whitespace, but no other kind of prefix.
Also, if CITATION-REGEXP is non-nil, don't fill header lines.<a name="texi2info"></a>
<h3>Function: texi2info</h3>
Convert the current buffer (written in Texinfo code) into an Info file.
The Info file output is generated in a buffer visiting the Info file
names specified in the @setfilename command.</p>
<p>
This function automatically updates all node pointers and menus, and
creates a master menu.  This work is done on a temporary buffer that
is automatically removed when the Info file is created.  The original
Texinfo source buffer is not changed.</p>
<p>
Non-nil argument (prefix, if interactive) means don't split the file
if large.  You can use `Info-split' to do this manually.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional NOSPLIT)<a name="tags-search"></a>
<h3>Function: tags-search</h3>
Search through all files listed in tags table for match for REGEXP.
Stops when a match is found.
To continue searching for next match, use command M-,.</p>
<p>
If FILE-LIST-FORM is non-nil, it should be a form that, when
evaluated, will return a list of file names.  The search will be
restricted to these files.</p>
<p>

<p>
(fn REGEXP &optional FILE-LIST-FORM)<a name="pop-to-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: pop-to-buffer</h3>
Select buffer BUFFER in some window, preferably a different one.
BUFFER may be a buffer, a string (a buffer name), or nil.  If it
is a string not naming an existent buffer, create a buffer with
that name.  If BUFFER is nil, choose some other buffer.  Return
the buffer.</p>
<p>
This uses `display-buffer' as a subroutine.  The optional ACTION
argument is passed to `display-buffer' as its ACTION argument.
See `display-buffer' for more information.  ACTION is t if called
interactively with a prefix argument, which means to pop to a
window other than the selected one even if the buffer is already
displayed in the selected window.</p>
<p>
If the window to show BUFFER is not on the selected
frame, raise that window's frame and give it input focus.</p>
<p>
Optional third arg NORECORD non-nil means do not put this buffer
at the front of the list of recently selected ones.<a name="terminal-list"></a>
<h3>Function: terminal-list</h3>
Return a list of all terminal devices.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="frame-pointer-visible-p"></a>
<h3>Function: frame-pointer-visible-p</h3>
Return t if the mouse pointer displayed on FRAME is visible.
Otherwise it returns nil.  FRAME omitted or nil means the
selected frame.  This is useful when `make-pointer-invisible' is set.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FRAME)<a name="mapatoms"></a>
<h3>Function: mapatoms</h3>
Call FUNCTION on every symbol in OBARRAY.
OBARRAY defaults to the value of `obarray'.</p>
<p>
(fn FUNCTION &optional OBARRAY)<a name="custom-face-edit-attribute-tag"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-face-edit-attribute-tag</h3>
Return the first :tag property in WIDGET or one of its children.<a name="comint-magic-space"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-magic-space</h3>
Expand input history references before point and insert ARG spaces.
A useful command to bind to SPC.  See `comint-replace-by-expanded-history'.</p>
<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="comint-next-matching-input"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-next-matching-input</h3>
Search forwards through input history for match for REGEXP.
(Later history elements are more recent commands.)
With prefix argument N, search for Nth following match.
If N is negative, find the previous or Nth previous match.</p>
<p>
(fn REGEXP N)<a name="syntax-propertize-via-font-lock"></a>
<h3>Function: syntax-propertize-via-font-lock</h3>
Propertize for syntax in START..END using font-lock syntax.
KEYWORDS obeys the format used in `font-lock-syntactic-keywords'.
The return value is a function suitable for `syntax-propertize-function'.</p>
<p>
(fn KEYWORDS)<a name="vc-annotate"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-annotate</h3>
Display the edit history of the current FILE using colors.</p>
<p>
This command creates a buffer that shows, for each line of the current
file, when it was last edited and by whom.  Additionally, colors are
used to show the age of each line--blue means oldest, red means
youngest, and intermediate colors indicate intermediate ages.  By
default, the time scale stretches back one year into the past;
everything that is older than that is shown in blue.</p>
<p>
With a prefix argument, this command asks two questions in the
minibuffer.  First, you may enter a revision number REV; then the buffer
displays and annotates that revision instead of the working revision
(type RET in the minibuffer to leave that default unchanged).  Then,
you are prompted for the time span in days which the color range
should cover.  For example, a time span of 20 days means that changes
over the past 20 days are shown in red to blue, according to their
age, and everything that is older than that is shown in blue.</p>
<p>
If MOVE-POINT-TO is given, move the point to that line.</p>
<p>
If VC-BK is given used that VC backend.</p>
<p>
Customization variables:</p>
<p>
`vc-annotate-menu-elements' customizes the menu elements of the
mode-specific menu.  `vc-annotate-color-map' and
`vc-annotate-very-old-color' define the mapping of time to colors.
`vc-annotate-background' specifies the background color.</p>

(fn FORM)<a name="dired-do-load"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-do-load</h3>
Load the marked (or next ARG) Emacs Lisp files.<a name="comint-arguments"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-arguments</h3>
Return from STRING the NTH to MTH arguments.
NTH and/or MTH can be nil, which means the last argument.
Returned arguments are separated by single spaces.
We assume whitespace separates arguments, except within quotes
and except for a space or tab that immediately follows a backslash.
Also, a run of one or more of a single character
in `comint-delimiter-argument-list' is a separate argument.
Argument 0 is the command name.</p>
<p>
(fn STRING NTH MTH)<a name="url-open-stream"></a>
<h3>Function: url-open-stream</h3>
Open a stream to HOST, possibly via a gateway.
Args per `open-network-stream'.
Will not make a connection if `url-gateway-unplugged' is non-nil.
Might do a non-blocking connection; use `process-status' to check.<a name="mouse-drag-throw"></a>
<h3>Function: mouse-drag-throw</h3>
"Throw" the page according to a mouse drag.</p>
<p>
A "throw" is scrolling the page at a speed relative to the distance
from the original mouse click to the current mouse location.  Try it;
you'll like it.  It's easier to observe than to explain.</p>
<p>
If the mouse is clicked and released in the same place of time we
assume that the user didn't want to scroll but wanted to whatever
mouse-2 used to do, so we pass it through.</p>
<p>
Throw scrolling was inspired (but is not identical to) the "hand"
option in MacPaint, or the middle button in Tk text widgets.</p>
<p>
If `mouse-throw-with-scroll-bar' is non-nil, then this command scrolls
in the opposite direction.  (Different people have different ideas
about which direction is natural.  Perhaps it has to do with which
hemisphere you're in.)</p>

If `same-window-p' returns non-nil for BUFFER's name, call
`display-buffer-same-window' and return its value.  Otherwise,
return nil.<a name="signal"></a>
<h3>Function: signal</h3>
Signal an error.  Args are ERROR-SYMBOL and associated DATA.
This function does not return.</p>
<p>
An error symbol is a symbol with an `error-conditions' property
that is a list of condition names.
A handler for any of those names will get to handle this signal.
The symbol `error' should normally be one of them.</p>
<p>
DATA should be a list.  Its elements are printed as part of the error message.
See Info anchor `(elisp)Definition of signal' for some details on how this
error message is constructed.
If the signal is handled, DATA is made available to the handler.

<p>
Interactively, the command prompts for N-UP printing number and, when you use a
prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the user for a file name, and saves
the PostScript image in that file instead of saving it in a temporary file.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, if N-UP is nil, prompts for N-UP printing number.  The
argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it's nil, save the image in a
temporary file.  If FILENAME is a string, save the PostScript image in a file
with that name.  If FILENAME is t, prompts for a file name.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: epa-decrypt-region</h3>
Decrypt the current region between START and END.</p>
<p>
If MAKE-BUFFER-FUNCTION is non-nil, call it to prepare an output buffer.
It should return that buffer.  If it copies the input, it should
delete the text now being decrypted.  It should leave point at the
proper place to insert the plaintext.</p>
<p>
Be careful about using this command in Lisp programs!
Since this function operates on regions, it does some tricks such
as coding-system detection and unibyte/multibyte conversion.  If
you are sure how the data in the region should be treated, you
should consider using the string based counterpart
`epg-decrypt-string', or the file based counterpart
`epg-decrypt-file' instead.</p>
<p>
For example:</p>
<p>
(let ((context (epg-make-context 'OpenPGP)))
  (decode-coding-string
    (epg-decrypt-string context (buffer-substring start end))
    'utf-8))</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: tex-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing files of input for TeX, LaTeX, or SliTeX.
Tries to determine (by looking at the beginning of the file) whether
this file is for plain TeX, LaTeX, or SliTeX and calls `plain-tex-mode',
`latex-mode', or `slitex-mode', respectively.  If it cannot be determined,
such as if there are no commands in the file, the value of `tex-default-mode'
says which mode to use.</p>

instead of sending it to the printer.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, the argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it is nil,
send the image to the printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save the PostScript
image in a file with that name.</p>

(fn SEQ PREDICATE [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="table-capture"></a>
<h3>Function: table-capture</h3>
Convert plain text into a table by capturing the text in the region.
Create a table with the text in region as cell contents.  BEG and END
specify the region.  The text in the region is replaced with a table.
The removed text is inserted in the table.  When optional
COL-DELIM-REGEXP and ROW-DELIM-REGEXP are provided the region contents
is parsed and separated into individual cell contents by using the
delimiter regular expressions.  This parsing determines the number of
columns and rows of the table automatically.  If COL-DELIM-REGEXP and
ROW-DELIM-REGEXP are omitted the result table has only one cell and
the entire region contents is placed in that cell.  Optional JUSTIFY
is one of 'left, 'center or 'right, which specifies the cell
justification.  Optional MIN-CELL-WIDTH specifies the minimum cell
width.  Optional COLUMNS specify the number of columns when
ROW-DELIM-REGEXP is not specified.</p>
<p>

Example 1:</p>
<p>
1, 2, 3, 4
5, 6, 7, 8
, 9, 10</p>
<p>
Running `table-capture' on above 3 line region with COL-DELIM-REGEXP
"," and ROW-DELIM-REGEXP "\n" creates the following table.  In
this example the cells are centered and minimum cell width is
specified as 5.</p>
<p>
+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|     |  9  | 10  |     |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+</p>
<p>
Note:</p>
<p>
In case the function is called interactively user must use C-q `quoted-insert'
in order to enter "\n" successfully.  COL-DELIM-REGEXP at the end
of each row is optional.</p>
<p>

Example 2:</p>
<p>
This example shows how a table can be used for text layout editing.
Let `table-capture' capture the following region starting from
-!- and ending at -*-, that contains three paragraphs and two item
name headers.  This time specify empty string for both
COL-DELIM-REGEXP and ROW-DELIM-REGEXP.</p>
<p>
-!-`table-capture' is a powerful command however mastering its power
requires some practice.  Here is a list of items what it can do.</p>
<p>
Parse Cell Items      By using column delimiter regular
		      expression and raw delimiter regular
		      expression, it parses the specified text
		      area and extracts cell items from
		      non-table text and then forms a table out
		      of them.</p>
<p>
Capture Text Area     When no delimiters are specified it
		      creates a single cell table.  The text in
		      the specified region is placed in that
		      cell.-*-</p>
<p>
Now the entire content is captured in a cell which is itself a table
like this.</p>

<h3>Function: face-foreground</h3>
Return the foreground color name of FACE, or nil if unspecified.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.</p>
<p>
If INHERIT is nil, only a foreground color directly defined by FACE is
  considered, so the return value may be nil.
If INHERIT is t, and FACE doesn't define a foreground color, then any
  foreground color that FACE inherits through its `:inherit' attribute
  is considered as well; however the return value may still be nil.
If INHERIT is a face or a list of faces, then it is used to try to
  resolve an unspecified foreground color.</p>
<p>
To ensure that a valid color is always returned, use a value of
`default' for INHERIT; this will resolve any unspecified values by
merging with the `default' face (which is always completely specified).<a name="flycheck-first-error"></a>

	  to column view).  When "file:path/to/file.org", invoke column
	  view at the start of that file.  Otherwise, the ID is located
	  using `org-id-find'.
:hlines   When t, insert a hline before each item.  When a number, insert
	  a hline before each level <= that number.

the variables `sql-database' and `sql-server' as default, if set.
Additional command line parameters can be stored in the list
`sql-postgres-options'.</p>
<p>
The buffer is put in SQL interactive mode, giving commands for sending
input.  See `sql-interactive-mode'.</p>
<p>
To set the buffer name directly, use C-u
before M-x sql-postgres.  Once session has started,
M-x sql-rename-buffer can be called separately to rename the
buffer.</p>
<p>
To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the input and output to the process, use C-x RET c
before M-x sql-postgres.  You can also specify this with C-x RET p
in the SQL buffer, after you start the process.
The default comes from `process-coding-system-alist' and
`default-process-coding-system'.  If your output lines end with ^M,
your might try undecided-dos as a coding system.  If this doesn't help,
Try to set `comint-output-filter-functions' like this:</p>

<p>
Variables controlling indentation/edit style:</p>
<p>
 variable `verilog-indent-level'      (default 3)
   Indentation of Verilog statements with respect to containing block.
 `verilog-indent-level-module'        (default 3)
   Absolute indentation of Module level Verilog statements.
   Set to 0 to get initial and always statements lined up
   on the left side of your screen.
 `verilog-indent-level-declaration'   (default 3)
   Indentation of declarations with respect to containing block.
   Set to 0 to get them list right under containing block.
 `verilog-indent-level-behavioral'    (default 3)
   Indentation of first begin in a task or function block
   Set to 0 to get such code to lined up underneath the task or
   function keyword.
 `verilog-indent-level-directive'     (default 1)
   Indentation of `ifdef/`endif blocks.
 `verilog-cexp-indent'              (default 1)
   Indentation of Verilog statements broken across lines i.e.:
      if (a)
        begin
 `verilog-case-indent'              (default 2)
   Indentation for case statements.
 `verilog-auto-newline'             (default nil)
   Non-nil means automatically newline after semicolons and the punctuation
   mark after an end.
 `verilog-auto-indent-on-newline'   (default t)
   Non-nil means automatically indent line after newline.
 `verilog-tab-always-indent'        (default t)
   Non-nil means TAB in Verilog mode should always reindent the current line,
   regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 `verilog-indent-begin-after-if'    (default t)
   Non-nil means to indent begin statements following a preceding
   if, else, while, for and repeat statements, if any.  Otherwise,
   the begin is lined up with the preceding token.  If t, you get:
      if (a)
         begin // amount of indent based on `verilog-cexp-indent'
   otherwise you get:
      if (a)
      begin
 `verilog-auto-endcomments'         (default t)
   Non-nil means a comment /* ... */ is set after the ends which ends
   cases, tasks, functions and modules.
   The type and name of the object will be set between the braces.
 `verilog-minimum-comment-distance' (default 10)
   Minimum distance (in lines) between begin and end required before a comment
   will be inserted.  Setting this variable to zero results in every
   end acquiring a comment; the default avoids too many redundant
   comments in tight quarters.

<h3>Function: ert--force-message-log-buffer-truncation</h3>
Immediately truncate *Messages* buffer according to `message-log-max'.</p>
<p>
This can be useful after reducing the value of `message-log-max'.<a name="comint-regexp-arg"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-regexp-arg</h3>
Return list of regexp and prefix arg using PROMPT.</p>
<p>
(fn PROMPT)<a name="type-break-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: type-break-mode</h3>
Enable or disable typing-break mode.
This is a minor mode, but it is global to all buffers by default.</p>
<p>
When this mode is enabled, the user is encouraged to take typing breaks at
appropriate intervals; either after a specified amount of time or when the
user has exceeded a keystroke threshold.  When the time arrives, the user
is asked to take a break.  If the user refuses at that time, Emacs will ask
again in a short period of time.  The idea is to give the user enough time
to find a good breaking point in his or her work, but be sufficiently
annoying to discourage putting typing breaks off indefinitely.</p>
<p>
A negative prefix argument disables this mode.
No argument or any non-negative argument enables it.</p>
<p>
The user may enable or disable this mode by setting the variable of the
same name, though setting it in that way doesn't reschedule a break or
reset the keystroke counter.</p>
<p>
If the mode was previously disabled and is enabled as a consequence of
calling this function, it schedules a break with `type-break-schedule' to
make sure one occurs (the user can call that command to reschedule the
break at any time).  It also initializes the keystroke counter.</p>
<p>
The variable `type-break-interval' specifies the number of seconds to
schedule between regular typing breaks.  This variable doesn't directly
affect the time schedule; it simply provides a default for the
`type-break-schedule' command.</p>
<p>
If set, the variable `type-break-good-rest-interval' specifies the minimum
amount of time which is considered a reasonable typing break.  Whenever
that time has elapsed, typing breaks are automatically rescheduled for
later even if Emacs didn't prompt you to take one first.  Also, if a break
is ended before this much time has elapsed, the user will be asked whether
or not to continue.  A nil value for this variable prevents automatic
break rescheduling, making `type-break-interval' an upper bound on the time
between breaks.  In this case breaks will be prompted for as usual before
the upper bound if the keystroke threshold is reached.</p>
<p>
If `type-break-good-rest-interval' is nil and
`type-break-good-break-interval' is set, then confirmation is required to
interrupt a break before `type-break-good-break-interval' seconds
have passed.  This provides for an upper bound on the time between breaks
together with confirmation of interruptions to these breaks.</p>
<p>
The variable `type-break-keystroke-threshold' is used to determine the
thresholds at which typing breaks should be considered.  You can use
the command `type-break-guesstimate-keystroke-threshold' to try to
approximate good values for this.</p>
<p>
There are several variables that affect how or when warning messages about
imminent typing breaks are displayed.  They include:</p>
<p>
        `type-break-mode-line-message-mode'
        `type-break-time-warning-intervals'
        `type-break-keystroke-warning-intervals'
        `type-break-warning-repeat'
        `type-break-warning-countdown-string'
        `type-break-warning-countdown-string-type'</p>
<p>
There are several variables that affect if, how, and when queries to begin
a typing break occur.  They include:</p>
<p>
        `type-break-query-mode'
        `type-break-query-function'
        `type-break-query-interval'</p>
<p>
The command `type-break-statistics' prints interesting things.</p>
<p>
Finally, a file (named `type-break-file-name') is used to store information
across Emacs sessions.  This provides recovery of the break status between
sessions and after a crash.  Manual changes to the file may result in
problems.</p>

(fn &optional ARG)<a name="mail-unquote-printable-region"></a>
<h3>Function: mail-unquote-printable-region</h3>
Undo the "quoted printable" encoding in buffer from BEG to END.
If the optional argument WRAPPER is non-nil,
we expect to find and remove the wrapper characters =?ISO-8859-1?Q?....?=.
On encountering malformed quoted-printable text, exits with an error,
unless NOERROR is non-nil, in which case it continues, and returns nil
when finished.  Returns non-nil on successful completion.
If UNIBYTE is non-nil, insert converted characters as unibyte.
That is useful if you are going to character code decoding afterward,
as Rmail does.<a name="gmm-tool-bar-from-list"></a>
<h3>Function: gmm-tool-bar-from-list</h3>
Make a tool bar from ICON-LIST.</p>
<p>
Within each entry of ICON-LIST, the first element is a menu
command, the second element is an icon file name and the third
element is a test function.  You can use C-h k
<menu-entry> to find out the name of a menu command.  The fourth
and all following elements are passed as the PROPS argument to the
function `tool-bar-local-item'.</p>
<p>
If ZAP-LIST is a list, remove those item from the default
`tool-bar-map'.  If it is t, start with a new sparse map.  You
can use C-h k <icon> to find out the name of an icon
item.  When C-h k <icon> shows "<tool-bar> <new-file>
runs the command find-file", then use `new-file' in ZAP-LIST.</p>
<p>
DEFAULT-MAP specifies the default key map for ICON-LIST.</p>
<p>
(fn ICON-LIST ZAP-LIST DEFAULT-MAP)<a name="eudc-query-form"></a>
<h3>Function: eudc-query-form</h3>

queries the server for the existing fields and displays a corresponding form.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional GET-FIELDS-FROM-SERVER)<a name="outline-minor-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: outline-minor-mode</h3>
Toggle Outline minor mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Outline minor mode if ARG is

Indicate how FILES are checked out.</p>
<p>
If FILES are not registered, this function always returns nil.
For registered files, the possible values are:</p>
<p>
  'implicit   FILES are always writable, and checked out `implicitly'
              when the user saves the first changes to the file.</p>
<p>
  'locking    FILES are read-only if up-to-date; user must type
              C-x v v before editing.  Strict locking

<p>
(fn FILE-A FILE-B FILE-C &optional STARTUP-HOOKS)<a name="insert-for-yank-1"></a>
<h3>Function: insert-for-yank-1</h3>
Insert STRING at point for the `yank' command.
This function is like `insert', except it honors the variables
`yank-handled-properties' and `yank-excluded-properties', and the
`yank-handler' text property.</p>
<p>
Properties listed in `yank-handled-properties' are processed,
then those listed in `yank-excluded-properties' are discarded.</p>
<p>
If STRING has a non-nil `yank-handler' property on its first
character, the normal insert behavior is altered.  The value of
the `yank-handler' property must be a list of one to four
elements, of the form (FUNCTION PARAM NOEXCLUDE UNDO).
FUNCTION, if non-nil, should be a function of one argument, an
 object to insert; it is called instead of `insert'.
PARAM, if present and non-nil, replaces STRING as the argument to
 FUNCTION or `insert'; e.g. if FUNCTION is `yank-rectangle', PARAM
 may be a list of strings to insert as a rectangle.
If NOEXCLUDE is present and non-nil, the normal removal of
 `yank-excluded-properties' is not performed; instead FUNCTION is
 responsible for the removal.  This may be necessary if FUNCTION
 adjusts point before or after inserting the object.
UNDO, if present and non-nil, should be a function to be called
 by `yank-pop' to undo the insertion of the current object.  It is
 given two arguments, the start and end of the region.  FUNCTION
 may set `yank-undo-function' to override UNDO.<a name="ert-string-for-test-result"></a>
<h3>Function: ert-string-for-test-result</h3>
Return a string that represents the test result RESULT.</p>
<p>
EXPECTEDP specifies whether the result was expected.<a name="Info-mouse-follow-nearest-node"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-mouse-follow-nearest-node</h3>
Follow a node reference near point.
Like m, f, n, p or ^ command, depending on where you click.
At end of the node's text, moves to the next node, or up if none.<a name="landmark-repeat"></a>

Return t if it is safe to eval EXP when it is found in a file.<a name="inhibit-local-variables-p"></a>
<h3>Function: inhibit-local-variables-p</h3>
Return non-nil if file local variables should be ignored.
This checks the file (or buffer) name against `inhibit-local-variables-regexps'
and `inhibit-local-variables-suffixes'.<a name="cd-absolute"></a>
<h3>Function: cd-absolute</h3>
Change current directory to given absolute file name DIR.<a name="comment-normalize-vars"></a>
<h3>Function: comment-normalize-vars</h3>
Check and set up variables needed by other commenting functions.
All the `comment-*' commands call this function to set up various
variables, like `comment-start', to ensure that the commenting
functions work correctly.  Lisp callers of any other `comment-*'
function should first call this function explicitly.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional NOERROR)<a name="font-lock-value-in-major-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: font-lock-value-in-major-mode</h3>
Return value in ALIST for `major-mode', or ALIST if it is not an alist.
Structure is ((MAJOR-MODE . VALUE) ...) where MAJOR-MODE may be t.<a name="define-global-abbrev"></a>
<h3>Function: define-global-abbrev</h3>
Define ABBREV as a global abbreviation for EXPANSION.
The characters in ABBREV must all be word constituents in the standard
syntax table.</p>
<p>
(fn ABBREV EXPANSION)<a name="sort-columns"></a>
<h3>Function: sort-columns</h3>
Sort lines in region alphabetically by a certain range of columns.
For the purpose of this command, the region BEG...END includes
the entire line that point is in and the entire line the mark is in.
The column positions of point and mark bound the range of columns to sort on.
A prefix argument means sort into REVERSE order.
The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects
the sort order.</p>
<p>
Note that `sort-columns' rejects text that contains tabs,
because tabs could be split across the specified columns
and it doesn't know how to handle that.  Also, when possible,
it uses the `sort' utility program, which doesn't understand tabs.
Use M-x untabify to convert tabs to spaces before sorting.</p>
<p>
(fn REVERSE &optional BEG END)<a name="bindings--define-key"></a>
<h3>Function: bindings--define-key</h3>
Make as much as possible of the menus pure.<a name="define-fringe-bitmap"></a>
<h3>Function: define-fringe-bitmap</h3>
Define fringe bitmap BITMAP from BITS of size HEIGHT x WIDTH.
BITMAP is a symbol identifying the new fringe bitmap.
BITS is either a string or a vector of integers.
HEIGHT is height of bitmap.  If HEIGHT is nil, use length of BITS.
WIDTH must be an integer between 1 and 16, or nil which defaults to 8.
Optional fifth arg ALIGN may be one of `top', `center', or `bottom',
indicating the positioning of the bitmap relative to the rows where it
is used; the default is to center the bitmap.  Fifth arg may also be a
list (ALIGN PERIODIC) where PERIODIC non-nil specifies that the bitmap
should be repeated.
If BITMAP already exists, the existing definition is replaced.</p>
<p>
(fn BITMAP BITS &optional HEIGHT WIDTH ALIGN)<a name="window-at"></a>
<h3>Function: window-at</h3>
Return window containing coordinates X and Y on FRAME.
FRAME must be a live frame and defaults to the selected one.
The top left corner of the frame is considered to be row 0,
column 0.</p>
<p>
(fn X Y &optional FRAME)<a name="current-idle-time"></a>
<h3>Function: current-idle-time</h3>
Return the current length of Emacs idleness, or nil.
The value when Emacs is idle is a list of four integers (HIGH LOW USEC PSEC)
in the same style as (current-time).</p>
<p>
The value when Emacs is not idle is nil.</p>
<p>
PSEC is a multiple of the system clock resolution.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="flycheck-parse-error-with-patterns"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-parse-error-with-patterns</h3>
Parse a gle ERR with error PATTERNS for CHECKER.</p>
<p>
Apply each pattern in PATTERNS to ERR, in the given order, and
return the first parsed error.<a name="gnus-next-char-property-change"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-next-char-property-change</h3>
Return the position of next text property or overlay change.
This scans characters forward in the current buffer from POSITION till
it finds a change in some text property, or the beginning or end of an
overlay, and returns the position of that.
If none is found up to (point-max), the function returns (point-max).</p>
<p>
If the optional second argument LIMIT is non-nil, don't search
past position LIMIT; return LIMIT if nothing is found before LIMIT.
LIMIT is a no-op if it is greater than (point-max).</p>
<p>
(fn POSITION &optional LIMIT)<a name="mm-detect-mime-charset-region"></a>
<h3>Function: mm-detect-mime-charset-region</h3>
Detect MIME charset of the text in the region between START and END.<a name="password-read-and-add"></a>
<h3>Function: password-read-and-add</h3>
Read password, for use with KEY, from user, or from cache if wanted.
Then store the password in the cache.  Uses `password-read' and
`password-cache-add'.  Custom variables `password-cache' and
`password-cache-expiry' regulate cache behavior.</p>
<p>
Warning: the password is cached without checking that it is
correct.  It is better to check the password before caching.  If
you must use this function, take care to check passwords and
remove incorrect ones from the cache.<a name="dired-dnd-handle-local-file"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-dnd-handle-local-file</h3>
Copy, move or link a file to the dired directory.
URI is the file to handle, ACTION is one of copy, move, link or ask.
Ask means pop up a menu for the user to select one of copy, move or link.</p>
<p>
(fn URI ACTION)<a name="allout-setup"></a>
<h3>Function: allout-setup</h3>
Do fundamental Emacs session for allout auto-activation.</p>
<p>
Establishes allout processing as part of visiting a file if
`allout-auto-activation' is non-nil, or removes it otherwise.</p>
<p>
The proper way to use this is through customizing the setting of
`allout-auto-activation'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="sgml-guess-indent"></a>
<h3>Function: sgml-guess-indent</h3>
Guess an appropriate value for `sgml-basic-offset'.
Base the guessed indentation level on the first indented tag in the buffer.
Add this to `sgml-mode-hook' for convenience.<a name="extended-loop-p"></a>
<h3>Function: extended-loop-p</h3>
True if an extended loop form starts at LOOP-START.<a name="ring-size"></a>
<h3>Function: ring-size</h3>
Return the size of RING, the maximum number of elements it can contain.<a name="occur-prev"></a>
<h3>Function: occur-prev</h3>
Move to the Nth (default 1) previous match in an Occur mode buffer.<a name="replace-string"></a>
<h3>Function: replace-string</h3>
Replace occurrences of FROM-STRING with TO-STRING.
Preserve case in each match if `case-replace' and `case-fold-search'
are non-nil and FROM-STRING has no uppercase letters.
(Preserving case means that if the string matched is all caps, or capitalized,
then its replacement is upcased or capitalized.)</p>
<p>
If `replace-lax-whitespace' is non-nil, a space or spaces in the string
to be replaced will match a sequence of whitespace chars defined by the
regexp in `search-whitespace-regexp'.</p>
<p>
In Transient Mark mode, if the mark is active, operate on the contents
of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the end of the buffer.</p>
<p>
Third arg DELIMITED (prefix arg if interactive), if non-nil, means replace
only matches surrounded by word boundaries.
Fourth and fifth arg START and END specify the region to operate on.</p>
<p>
Use M-n to pull the last incremental search string to the minibuffer
that reads FROM-STRING.</p>
<p>
This function is usually the wrong thing to use in a Lisp program.
What you probably want is a loop like this:
  (while (search-forward FROM-STRING nil t)
    (replace-match TO-STRING nil t))
which will run faster and will not set the mark or print anything.
(You may need a more complex loop if FROM-STRING can match the null string
and TO-STRING is also null.)<a name="smtpmail-send-queued-mail"></a>
<h3>Function: smtpmail-send-queued-mail</h3>
Send mail that was queued as a result of setting `smtpmail-queue-mail'.</p>

<p>

(fn FORM ARG &rest OTHERS)<a name="thumbs-dired-show"></a>
<h3>Function: thumbs-dired-show</h3>
In dired, make a thumbs buffer with all files in current directory.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="apropos-documentation"></a>
<h3>Function: apropos-documentation</h3>
Show symbols whose documentation contains matches for PATTERN.
PATTERN can be a word, a list of words (separated by spaces),
or a regexp (using some regexp special characters).  If it is a word,
search for matches for that word as a substring.  If it is a list of words,
search for matches for any two (or more) of those words.</p>
<p>
Note that by default this command only searches in the file specified by
`internal-doc-file-name'; i.e., the etc/DOC file.  With C-u prefix,
or if `apropos-do-all' is non-nil, it searches all currently defined
documentation strings.</p>
<p>
Returns list of symbols and documentation found.<a name="window-size-fixed-p"></a>
<h3>Function: window-size-fixed-p</h3>
Return non-nil if WINDOW's height is fixed.
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.
Optional argument HORIZONTAL non-nil means return non-nil if
WINDOW's width is fixed.</p>
<p>
If this function returns nil, this does not necessarily mean that
WINDOW can be resized in the desired direction.  The function
`window-resizable' can tell that.<a name="easy-menu-convert-item"></a>
<h3>Function: easy-menu-convert-item</h3>
Memoize the value returned by `easy-menu-convert-item-1' called on ITEM.
This makes key-shortcut-caching work a *lot* better when this
conversion is done from within a filter.
This also helps when the NAME of the entry is recreated each time:
since the menu is built and traversed separately, the lookup
would always fail because the key is `equal' but not `eq'.<a name="cl-copy-tree"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-copy-tree</h3>
Make a copy of TREE.
If TREE is a cons cell, this recursively copies both its car and its cdr.
Contrast to `copy-sequence', which copies only along the cdrs.  With second
argument VECP, this copies vectors as well as conses.<a name="titdic-convert"></a>
<h3>Function: titdic-convert</h3>
Convert a TIT dictionary of FILENAME into a Quail package.
Optional argument DIRNAME if specified is the directory name under which
the generated Quail package is saved.</p>
<p>
(fn FILENAME &optional DIRNAME)<a name="concat"></a>
<h3>Function: concat</h3>
Concatenate all the arguments and make the result a string.
The result is a string whose elements are the elements of all the arguments.
Each argument may be a string or a list or vector of characters (integers).</p>
<p>
(fn &rest SEQUENCES)<a name="ispell-buffer-local-words"></a>
<h3>Function: ispell-buffer-local-words</h3>
Load the buffer-local dictionary in the current buffer.<a name="mm-set-buffer-multibyte"></a>
<h3>Function: mm-set-buffer-multibyte</h3>
Set the multibyte flag of the current buffer to FLAG.
If FLAG is t, this makes the buffer a multibyte buffer.
If FLAG is nil, this makes the buffer a single-byte buffer.
In these cases, the buffer contents remain unchanged as a sequence of
bytes but the contents viewed as characters do change.
If FLAG is `to', this makes the buffer a multibyte buffer by changing
all eight-bit bytes to eight-bit characters.
If the multibyte flag was really changed, undo information of the
current buffer is cleared.</p>
<p>
(fn FLAG)<a name="comint-kill-input"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-kill-input</h3>
Kill all text from last stuff output by interpreter to point.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: completion-initials-all-completions</h3></p>
<p>

(fn STRING TABLE PRED POINT)<a name="display-selections-p"></a>
<h3>Function: display-selections-p</h3>
Return non-nil if DISPLAY supports selections.
A selection is a way to transfer text or other data between programs
via special system buffers called `selection' or `clipboard'.
DISPLAY can be a display name, a frame, or nil (meaning the selected
frame's display).<a name="custom-variable-mark-to-save"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-variable-mark-to-save</h3>
Set value and mark for saving the variable edited by WIDGET.<a name="epl-find-installed-package"></a>
<h3>Function: epl-find-installed-package</h3>
Find the latest installed package by NAME.</p>
<p>
NAME is a package name, as symbol.</p>
<p>
Return the installed package with the highest version number as
`epl-package' object, or nil, if no package with NAME is
installed.</p>
<p>
(fn NAME)<a name="mm-set-buffer-file-coding-system"></a>
<h3>Function: mm-set-buffer-file-coding-system</h3>
Set the file coding-system of the current buffer to CODING-SYSTEM.
This means that when you save the buffer, it will be converted
according to CODING-SYSTEM.  For a list of possible values of
CODING-SYSTEM, use M-x list-coding-systems.</p>
<p>
If CODING-SYSTEM leaves the text conversion unspecified, or if it leaves
the end-of-line conversion unspecified, FORCE controls what to do.
If FORCE is nil, get the unspecified aspect (or aspects) from the buffer's
previous `buffer-file-coding-system' value (if it is specified there).
Otherwise, leave it unspecified.</p>
<p>
This marks the buffer modified so that the succeeding C-x C-s
surely saves the buffer with CODING-SYSTEM.  From a program, if you
don't want to mark the buffer modified, specify t for NOMODIFY.
If you know exactly what coding system you want to use,
just set the variable `buffer-file-coding-system' directly.<a name="debug-arglist"></a>
<h3>Function: debug-arglist</h3>
Return the argument list of DEFINITION.<a name="facemenu-set-invisible"></a>
<h3>Function: facemenu-set-invisible</h3>
Make the region invisible.
This sets the `invisible' text property; it can be undone with
`facemenu-remove-special'.<a name="info-emacs-bug"></a>

<h3>Function: gmm-widget-p</h3>
Non-nil if SYMBOL is a widget.</p>
<p>
(fn SYMBOL)<a name="abbreviate-file-name"></a>
<h3>Function: abbreviate-file-name</h3>
Return a version of FILENAME shortened using `directory-abbrev-alist'.
This also substitutes "~" for the user's home directory (unless the
home directory is a root directory) and removes automounter prefixes
(see the variable `automount-dir-prefix').<a name="x-popup-dialog"></a>
<h3>Function: x-popup-dialog</h3>
Pop up a dialog box and return user's selection.
POSITION specifies which frame to use.
This is normally a mouse button event or a window or frame.
If POSITION is t, it means to use the frame the mouse is on.
The dialog box appears in the middle of the specified frame.</p>
<p>
CONTENTS specifies the alternatives to display in the dialog box.
It is a list of the form (DIALOG ITEM1 ITEM2...).
Each ITEM is a cons cell (STRING . VALUE).
The return value is VALUE from the chosen item.</p>
<p>
An ITEM may also be just a string--that makes a nonselectable item.
An ITEM may also be nil--that means to put all preceding items
on the left of the dialog box and all following items on the right.
(By default, approximately half appear on each side.)</p>
<p>
If HEADER is non-nil, the frame title for the box is "Information",
otherwise it is "Question".</p>
<p>
If the user gets rid of the dialog box without making a valid choice,
for instance using the window manager, then this produces a quit and
`x-popup-dialog' does not return.</p>
<p>
(fn POSITION CONTENTS &optional HEADER)<a name="cl-remove-if"></a>

<h3>Function: url-generic-parse-url</h3>
Return an URL-struct of the parts of URL.
The CL-style struct contains the following fields:</p>
<p>
TYPE     is the URI scheme (string or nil).
USER     is the user name (string or nil).
PASSWORD is the password (string [deprecated] or nil).
HOST     is the host (a registered name, IP literal in square
         brackets, or IPv4 address in dotted-decimal form).
PORTSPEC is the specified port (a number), or nil.
FILENAME is the path AND the query component of the URI.
TARGET   is the fragment identifier component (used to refer to a
         subordinate resource, e.g. a part of a webpage).
ATTRIBUTES is nil; this slot originally stored the attribute and
         value alists for IMAP URIs, but this feature was removed
         since it conflicts with RFC 3986.
FULLNESS is non-nil iff the hierarchical sequence component of
         the URL starts with two slashes, "//".</p>
<p>
The parser follows RFC 3986, except that it also tries to handle
URIs that are not fully specified (e.g. lacking TYPE), and it
does not check for or perform %-encoding.</p>
<p>
Here is an example.  The URL</p>

With a prefix argument ARG, enable Auto Fill mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When Auto Fill mode is enabled, inserting a space at a column
beyond `current-fill-column' automatically breaks the line at a
previous space.</p>
<p>
When `auto-fill-mode' is on, the `auto-fill-function' variable is
non-`nil'.</p>
<p>
The value of `normal-auto-fill-function' specifies the function to use

<p>
(fn)<a name="manual-entry"></a>
<h3>Function: manual-entry</h3>
Get a Un*x manual page and put it in a buffer.
This command is the top-level command in the man package.  It
runs a Un*x command to retrieve and clean a manpage in the
background and places the results in a `Man-mode' browsing
buffer.  See variable `Man-notify-method' for what happens when
the buffer is ready.  If a buffer already exists for this man
page, it will display immediately.</p>
<p>
For a manpage from a particular section, use either of the
following.  "cat(1)" is how cross-references appear and is
passed to man as "1 cat".</p>
<p>
    cat(1)
    1 cat</p>
<p>
To see manpages from all sections related to a subject, use an
"all pages" option (which might be "-a" if it's not the
default), then step through with `Man-next-manpage' (
Uses keymap `Man-mode-map', which is not currently defined.
M-x Man-next-manpage) etc.
Add to `Man-switches' to make this option permanent.</p>
<p>
    -a chmod</p>

An explicit filename can be given too.  Use -l if it might
otherwise look like a page name.</p>
<p>
    /my/file/name.1.gz
    -l somefile.1</p>
<p>
An "apropos" query with -k gives a buffer of matching page
names or descriptions.  The pattern argument is usually an
"egrep" style regexp.</p>

(fn MAN-ARGS)<a name="ange-ftp-reread-dir"></a>
<h3>Function: ange-ftp-reread-dir</h3>
Reread remote directory DIR to update the directory cache.
The implementation of remote FTP file names caches directory contents
for speed.  Therefore, when new remote files are created, Emacs
may not know they exist.  You can use this command to reread a specific
directory, so that Emacs will know its current contents.</p>

<h3>Function: get-lru-window</h3>
Return the least recently used window on frames specified by ALL-FRAMES.
Return a full-width window if possible.  A minibuffer window is
never a candidate.  A dedicated window is never a candidate
unless DEDICATED is non-nil, so if all windows are dedicated, the
value is nil.  Avoid returning the selected window if possible.
Optional argument NOT-SELECTED non-nil means never return the
selected window.</p>
<p>
The following non-nil values of the optional argument ALL-FRAMES
have special meanings:</p>
<p>
- t means consider all windows on all existing frames.</p>
<p>
- `visible' means consider all windows on all visible frames on
  the current terminal.</p>
<p>
- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible
  and iconified frames on the current terminal.</p>
<p>
- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.</p>
<p>
Any other value of ALL-FRAMES means consider all windows on the
selected frame and no others.<a name="x-disown-selection-internal"></a>
<h3>Function: x-disown-selection-internal</h3>
If we own the selection SELECTION, disown it.
Disowning it means there is no such selection.</p>
<p>
Sets the last-change time for the selection to TIME-OBJECT (by default
the time of the last event).</p>
<p>
TERMINAL should be a terminal object or a frame specifying the X
server to query.  If omitted or nil, that stands for the selected
frame's display, or the first available X display.</p>
<p>
On Nextstep, the TIME-OBJECT and TERMINAL arguments are unused.
On MS-DOS, all this does is return non-nil if we own the selection.</p>

<h3>Function: tar-chgrp-entry</h3>
Change the group-id associated with this entry in the tar file.
If this tar file was written by GNU tar, then you will be able to edit
the group id as a string; otherwise, you must edit it as a number.
You can force editing as a number by calling this with a prefix arg.
This does not modify the disk image; you must save the tar file itself
for this to be permanent.<a name="byte-compile-top-level"></a>

(fn FORM &optional FOR-EFFECT OUTPUT-TYPE LEXENV RESERVED-CSTS)<a name="server-switch-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: server-switch-buffer</h3>
Switch to another buffer, preferably one that has a client.
Arg NEXT-BUFFER is a suggestion; if it is a live buffer, use it.</p>
<p>
KILLED-ONE is t in a recursive call if we have already killed one
temp-file server buffer.  This means we should avoid the final
"switch to some other buffer" since we've already effectively
done that.</p>
<p>
FILEPOS specifies a new buffer position for NEXT-BUFFER, if we
visit NEXT-BUFFER in an existing window.  If non-nil, it should
be a cons cell (LINENUMBER . COLUMNNUMBER).</p>

<h3>Function: diary</h3>
Generate the diary window for ARG days starting with the current date.
If no argument is provided, the number of days of diary entries is governed
by the variable `diary-number-of-entries'.  A value of ARG less than 1
does nothing.  This function is suitable for execution in an init file.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="face-spec-set-match-display"></a>
<h3>Function: face-spec-set-match-display</h3>
Non-nil if DISPLAY matches FRAME.
DISPLAY is part of a spec such as can be used in `defface'.
If FRAME is nil, the current FRAME is used.<a name="ignore"></a>

Delete all text in the current buffer with text property PROP.<a name="minibuffer-default-add-dired-shell-commands"></a>
<h3>Function: minibuffer-default-add-dired-shell-commands</h3>
Return a list of all commands associated with current dired files.
This function is used to add all related commands retrieved by `mailcap'
to the end of the list of defaults just after the default value.<a name="multi-isearch-read-matching-files"></a>
<h3>Function: multi-isearch-read-matching-files</h3>
Return a list of files whose names match specified wildcard.<a name="list*"></a>
<h3>Function: list*</h3>
Return a new list with specified ARGs as elements, consed to last ARG.
Thus, `(cl-list* A B C D)' is equivalent to `(nconc (list A B C) D)', or to
`(cons A (cons B (cons C D)))'.</p>

Find possibly suitable checkers for the current buffer.</p>
<p>
Return a list of all syntax checkers which could possibly be
suitable for the current buffer, if any problems in their setup
were fixed.</p>
<p>
Currently this function collects all registered syntax checkers
whose `:modes' contain the current major mode or which do not
have any `:modes', but a `:predicate' that returns non-nil for
the current buffer.<a name="dired-do-redisplay"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-do-redisplay</h3>
Redisplay all marked (or next ARG) files.
If on a subdir line, redisplay that subdirectory.  In that case,
a prefix arg lets you edit the `ls' switches used for the new listing.</p>
<p>
Dired remembers switches specified with a prefix arg, so that reverting
the buffer will not reset them.  However, using `dired-undo' to re-insert
or delete subdirectories can bypass this machinery.  Hence, you sometimes
may have to reset some subdirectory switches after a `dired-undo'.
You can reset all subdirectory switches to the default using
M-x dired-reset-subdir-switches.
See Info node `(emacs)Subdir switches' for more details.<a name="ido-insert-file"></a>

<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="set-process-inherit-coding-system-flag"></a>
<h3>Function: set-process-inherit-coding-system-flag</h3>
Determine whether buffer of PROCESS will inherit coding-system.
If the second argument FLAG is non-nil, then the variable
`buffer-file-coding-system' of the buffer associated with PROCESS
will be bound to the value of the coding system used to decode
the process output.</p>
<p>
This is useful when the coding system specified for the process buffer
leaves either the character code conversion or the end-of-line conversion
unspecified, or if the coding system used to decode the process output
is more appropriate for saving the process buffer.</p>
<p>
Binding the variable `inherit-process-coding-system' to non-nil before
starting the process is an alternative way of setting the inherit flag
for the process which will run.</p>
<p>
This function returns FLAG.</p>
<p>
(fn PROCESS FLAG)<a name="overwrite-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: overwrite-mode</h3>
Toggle Overwrite mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Overwrite mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When Overwrite mode is enabled, printing characters typed in
replace existing text on a one-for-one basis, rather than pushing
it to the right.  At the end of a line, such characters extend
the line.  Before a tab, such characters insert until the tab is
filled in.  C-q still inserts characters in
overwrite mode; this is supposed to make it easier to insert
characters when necessary.<a name="sgml-tag-help"></a>
<h3>Function: sgml-tag-help</h3>
Display description of tag TAG.  If TAG is omitted, use the tag at point.<a name="org-reload"></a>
<h3>Function: org-reload</h3>

<p>
(fn NUMBER)<a name="facemenu-set-default"></a>
<h3>Function: facemenu-set-default</h3>
Select face `default' for subsequent insertion.
If the mark is active and there is no prefix argument,
apply face `default' to the region instead.
This command was defined by `facemenu-add-new-face'.<a name="next-complete-history-element"></a>
<h3>Function: next-complete-history-element</h3>
Get next history element which completes the minibuffer before the point.
The contents of the minibuffer after the point are deleted, and replaced
by the new completion.<a name="todo-insert-item"></a>
<h3>Function: todo-insert-item</h3>
Insert new TODO list entry.
With a prefix argument ARG solicit the category, otherwise use the current
category.</p>
<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="mode-line-modified-help-echo"></a>
<h3>Function: mode-line-modified-help-echo</h3>
Return help text specifying WINDOW's buffer modification status.<a name="transient-mark-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: transient-mark-mode</h3>
Toggle Transient Mark mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Transient Mark mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
Transient Mark mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Transient Mark mode is a global minor mode.  When enabled, the
region is highlighted whenever the mark is active.  The mark is
"deactivated" by changing the buffer, and after certain other
operations that set the mark but whose main purpose is something
else--for example, incremental search, M-<, and M->.</p>
<p>
You can also deactivate the mark by typing C-g or
M-ESC ESC.</p>
<p>
Many commands change their behavior when Transient Mark mode is
in effect and the mark is active, by acting on the region instead
of their usual default part of the buffer's text.  Examples of
such commands include M-;, M-x flush-lines, M-x keep-lines,
M-%, C-M-%, M-x ispell, and C-x u.
To see the documentation of commands which are sensitive to the
Transient Mark mode, invoke C-h d and type "transient"
or "mark.*active" at the prompt.<a name="set-left-margin"></a>
<h3>Function: set-left-margin</h3>
Set the left margin of the region to WIDTH.
If `auto-fill-mode' is active, re-fill the region to fit the new margin.</p>
<p>
Interactively, WIDTH is the prefix argument, if specified.
Without prefix argument, the command prompts for WIDTH.<a name="reposition-window"></a>
<h3>Function: reposition-window</h3>
Make the current definition and/or comment visible.
Further invocations move it to the top of the window or toggle the
visibility of comments that precede it.
  Point is left unchanged unless prefix ARG is supplied.
  If the definition is fully onscreen, it is moved to the top of the
window.  If it is partly offscreen, the window is scrolled to get the
definition (or as much as will fit) onscreen, unless point is in a comment
which is also partly offscreen, in which case the scrolling attempts to get
as much of the comment onscreen as possible.
  Initially `reposition-window' attempts to make both the definition and
preceding comments visible.  Further invocations toggle the visibility of
the comment lines.
  If ARG is non-nil, point may move in order to make the whole defun
visible (if only part could otherwise be made so), to make the defun line
visible (if point is in code and it could not be made so, or if only
comments, including the first comment line, are visible), or to make the
first comment line visible (if point is in a comment).</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="custom-declare-group"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-declare-group</h3>
Like `defgroup', but SYMBOL is evaluated as a normal argument.<a name="epl-package-from-descriptor-file"></a>
<h3>Function: epl-package-from-descriptor-file</h3>
Load a `epl-package' from a package DESCRIPTOR-FILE.</p>
<p>
A package descriptor is a file defining a new package.  Its name
typically ends with -pkg.el.</p>
<p>
(fn DESCRIPTOR-FILE)<a name="ewoc--node-nth"></a>
<h3>Function: ewoc--node-nth</h3>
Return the Nth node from the doubly linked list `dll'.
N counts from zero.  If N is negative, return the -(N+1)th last element.
If N is out of range, return nil.
Thus, (ewoc--node-nth dll 0) returns the first node,
and (ewoc--node-nth dll -1) returns the last node.</p>
<p>
(fn DLL N)<a name="minibuffer-default-add-completions"></a>
<h3>Function: minibuffer-default-add-completions</h3>
Return a list of all completions without the default value.
This function is used to add all elements of the completion table to
the end of the list of defaults just after the default value.<a name="tmm-prompt"></a>
<h3>Function: tmm-prompt</h3>
Text-mode emulation of calling the bindings in keymap.
Creates a text-mode menu of possible choices.  You can access the elements
in the menu in two ways:
   *)  via history mechanism from minibuffer;
   *)  Or via completion-buffer that is automatically shown.
The last alternative is currently a hack, you cannot use mouse reliably.</p>
<p>
MENU is like the MENU argument to `x-popup-menu': either a
keymap or an alist of alists.
DEFAULT-ITEM, if non-nil, specifies an initial default choice.
Its value should be an event that has a binding in MENU.</p>
<p>
(fn MENU &optional IN-POPUP DEFAULT-ITEM)<a name="pr-despool-print"></a>
<h3>Function: pr-despool-print</h3>
Send the spooled PostScript to the printer.</p>
<p>
Interactively, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the
user for a file name, and saves the spooled PostScript image in that file
instead of sending it to the printer.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, the argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it is nil,
send the image to the printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save the PostScript
image in a file with that name.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FILENAME)<a name="tool-bar-lines-needed"></a>
<h3>Function: tool-bar-lines-needed</h3>
Return the number of lines occupied by the tool bar of FRAME.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FRAME)<a name="set-text-properties"></a>
<h3>Function: set-text-properties</h3>
Completely replace properties of text from START to END.
The third argument PROPERTIES is the new property list.
If the optional fourth argument OBJECT is a buffer (or nil, which means
the current buffer), START and END are buffer positions (integers or
markers).  If OBJECT is a string, START and END are 0-based indices into it.
If PROPERTIES is nil, the effect is to remove all properties from
the designated part of OBJECT.</p>
<p>
(fn START END PROPERTIES &optional OBJECT)<a name="pcomplete-match-string"></a>
<h3>Function: pcomplete-match-string</h3>
Like `match-string', but on the current completion argument.</p>
<p>
(fn WHICH &optional INDEX OFFSET)<a name="cl-mismatch"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-mismatch</h3>
Compare SEQ1 with SEQ2, return index of first mismatching element.
Return nil if the sequences match.  If one sequence is a prefix of the
other, the return value indicates the end of the shorter sequence.</p>
<p>
Keywords supported:  :test :test-not :key :start1 :end1 :start2 :end2 :from-end</p>

<h3>Function: indian-compose-string</h3></p>
<p>

(fn STRING)<a name="package-initialize"></a>
<h3>Function: package-initialize</h3>
Load Emacs Lisp packages, and activate them.
The variable `package-load-list' controls which packages to load.
If optional arg NO-ACTIVATE is non-nil, don't activate packages.<a name="ewoc-map"></a>
<h3>Function: ewoc-map</h3>
Apply MAP-FUNCTION to all elements in EWOC.
MAP-FUNCTION is applied to the first element first.
If MAP-FUNCTION returns non-nil the element will be refreshed (its
pretty-printer will be called once again).</p>
<p>
Note that the buffer for EWOC will be the current buffer when
MAP-FUNCTION is called.  MAP-FUNCTION must restore the current
buffer before it returns, if it changes it.</p>
<p>
If more than two arguments are given, the remaining
arguments will be passed to MAP-FUNCTION.</p>
<p>
(fn MAP-FUNCTION EWOC &rest ARGS)<a name="delete-other-windows-vertically"></a>
<h3>Function: delete-other-windows-vertically</h3>
Delete the windows in the same column with WINDOW, but not WINDOW itself.
This may be a useful alternative binding for C-x 1
 if you often split windows horizontally.<a name="comint-quote-filename"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-quote-filename</h3>
Return FILENAME with magic characters quoted.
Magic characters are those in `comint-file-name-quote-list'.</p>
<p>
(fn FILENAME)<a name="sdb"></a>
<h3>Function: sdb</h3>
Run sdb on program FILE in buffer *gud-FILE*.
The directory containing FILE becomes the initial working directory
and source-file directory for your debugger.</p>
<p>
(fn COMMAND-LINE)<a name="assoc"></a>
<h3>Function: assoc</h3>
Return non-nil if KEY is `equal' to the car of an element of LIST.
The value is actually the first element of LIST whose car equals KEY.</p>
<p>
(fn KEY LIST)<a name="isearch-describe-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: isearch-describe-mode</h3>
Display documentation of Isearch mode.<a name="syntax-ppss-toplevel-pos"></a>
<h3>Function: syntax-ppss-toplevel-pos</h3>
Get the latest syntactically outermost position found in a syntactic scan.
PPSS is a scan state, as returned by `parse-partial-sexp' or `syntax-ppss'.
An "outermost position" means one that it is outside of any syntactic entity:
outside of any parentheses, comments, or strings encountered in the scan.
If no such position is recorded in PPSS (because the end of the scan was
itself at the outermost level), return nil.</p>
<p>
(fn PPSS)<a name="remote-compile"></a>
<h3>Function: remote-compile</h3>
Compile the current buffer's directory on HOST.  Log in as USER.
See M-x compile.</p>
<p>
(fn HOST USER COMMAND)<a name="org-cycle"></a>
<h3>Function: org-cycle</h3>
TAB-action and visibility cycling for Org-mode.</p>
<p>
This is the command invoked in Org-mode by the TAB key.  Its main purpose
is outline visibility cycling, but it also invokes other actions
in special contexts.</p>
<p>
- When this function is called with a prefix argument, rotate the entire
  buffer through 3 states (global cycling)
  1. OVERVIEW: Show only top-level headlines.
  2. CONTENTS: Show all headlines of all levels, but no body text.
  3. SHOW ALL: Show everything.
  When called with two `C-u C-u' prefixes, switch to the startup visibility,
  determined by the variable `org-startup-folded', and by any VISIBILITY
  properties in the buffer.
  When called with three `C-u C-u C-u' prefixed, show the entire buffer,
  including any drawers.</p>
<p>
- When inside a table, re-align the table and move to the next field.</p>
<p>
- When point is at the beginning of a headline, rotate the subtree started
  by this line through 3 different states (local cycling)
  1. FOLDED:   Only the main headline is shown.
  2. CHILDREN: The main headline and the direct children are shown.
               From this state, you can move to one of the children
               and zoom in further.
  3. SUBTREE:  Show the entire subtree, including body text.
  If there is no subtree, switch directly from CHILDREN to FOLDED.</p>
<p>
- When point is at the beginning of an empty headline and the variable
  `org-cycle-level-after-item/entry-creation' is set, cycle the level
  of the headline by demoting and promoting it to likely levels.  This
  speeds up creation document structure by pressing TAB once or several
  times right after creating a new headline.</p>
<p>
- When there is a numeric prefix, go up to a heading with level ARG, do
  a `show-subtree' and return to the previous cursor position.  If ARG
  is negative, go up that many levels.</p>
<p>
- When point is not at the beginning of a headline, execute the global
  binding for TAB, which is re-indenting the line.  See the option
  `org-cycle-emulate-tab' for details.</p>
<p>
- Special case: if point is at the beginning of the buffer and there is
  no headline in line 1, this function will act as if called with prefix arg
  (C-u TAB, same as S-TAB) also when called without prefix arg.
  But only if also the variable `org-cycle-global-at-bob' is t.</p>

<h3>Function: what-domain</h3>
Convert mail domain DOMAIN to the country it corresponds to.</p>
<p>
(fn DOMAIN)<a name="read-face-and-attribute"></a>
<h3>Function: read-face-and-attribute</h3>
Read face name and face attribute value.
ATTRIBUTE is the attribute whose new value is read.
FRAME nil or unspecified means read attribute value of global face.
Value is a list (FACE NEW-VALUE) where FACE is the face read
(a symbol), and NEW-VALUE is value read.<a name="conf-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: conf-mode</h3>
Mode for Unix and Windows Conf files and Java properties.
Most conf files know only three kinds of constructs: parameter
assignments optionally grouped into sections and comments.  Yet
there is a great range of variation in the exact syntax of conf
files.  See below for various wrapper commands that set up the
details for some of the most widespread variants.</p>
<p>
This mode sets up font locking, outline, imenu and it provides
alignment support through `conf-align-assignments'.  If strings
come out wrong, try `conf-quote-normal'.</p>
<p>
Some files allow continuation lines, either with a backslash at
the end of line, or by indenting the next line (further).  These
constructs cannot currently be recognized.</p>
<p>
Because of this great variety of nuances, which are often not
even clearly specified, please don't expect it to get every file
quite right.  Patches that clearly identify some special case,
without breaking the general ones, are welcome.</p>
<p>
If instead you start this mode with the generic `conf-mode'
command, it will parse the buffer.  It will generally well
identify the first four cases listed below.  If the buffer
doesn't have enough contents to decide, this is identical to
`conf-windows-mode' on Windows, elsewhere to `conf-unix-mode'.
See also `conf-space-mode', `conf-colon-mode', `conf-javaprop-mode',
`conf-ppd-mode' and `conf-xdefaults-mode'.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `conf-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

(fn)<a name="set-frame-parameter"></a>
<h3>Function: set-frame-parameter</h3>
Set frame parameter PARAMETER to VALUE on FRAME.
If FRAME is nil, it defaults to the selected frame.
See `modify-frame-parameters'.<a name="flycheck-locate-config-file-home"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-locate-config-file-home</h3>
Locate a configuration FILENAME in the home directory.</p>
<p>
Return the absolute path, if FILENAME exists in the user's home
directory, or nil otherwise.<a name="object-print"></a>
<h3>Function: object-print</h3>
Pretty printer for object THIS.  Call function `object-name' with STRINGS.</p>
<p>
It is sometimes useful to put a summary of the object into the
default #<notation> string when using EIEIO browsing tools.
Implement this method to customize the summary.<a name="completion-table-case-fold"></a>
<h3>Function: completion-table-case-fold</h3>
Return new completion TABLE that is case insensitive.
If DONT-FOLD is non-nil, return a completion table that is
case sensitive instead.</p>
<p>
(fn TABLE &optional DONT-FOLD)<a name="ethio-write-file"></a>
<h3>Function: ethio-write-file</h3>
Transliterate Ethiopic characters in ASCII depending on the file extension.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="set-temporary-overlay-map"></a>
<h3>Function: set-temporary-overlay-map</h3>
Set MAP as a temporary keymap taking precedence over most other keymaps.
Note that this does NOT take precedence over the "overriding" maps
`overriding-terminal-local-map' and `overriding-local-map' (or the
`keymap' text property).  Unlike those maps, if no match for a key is
found in MAP, the normal key lookup sequence then continues.</p>
<p>
Normally, MAP is used only once.  If the optional argument
KEEP-PRED is t, MAP stays active if a key from MAP is used.
KEEP-PRED can also be a function of no arguments: if it returns
non-nil then MAP stays active.<a name="scan-lists"></a>
<h3>Function: scan-lists</h3>
Scan from character number FROM by COUNT lists.
Scan forward if COUNT is positive, backward if COUNT is negative.
Return the character number of the position thus found.</p>
<p>
A "list", in this context, refers to a balanced parenthetical
grouping, as determined by the syntax table.</p>
<p>
If DEPTH is nonzero, treat that as the nesting depth of the starting
point (i.e. the starting point is DEPTH parentheses deep).  This
function scans over parentheses until the depth goes to zero COUNT
times.  Hence, positive DEPTH moves out that number of levels of
parentheses, while negative DEPTH moves to a deeper level.</p>
<p>
Comments are ignored if `parse-sexp-ignore-comments' is non-nil.</p>
<p>
If we reach the beginning or end of the accessible part of the buffer
before we have scanned over COUNT lists, return nil if the depth at
that point is zero, and signal a error if the depth is nonzero.</p>
<p>
(fn FROM COUNT DEPTH)<a name="modify-category-entry"></a>
<h3>Function: modify-category-entry</h3>
Modify the category set of CHARACTER by adding CATEGORY to it.
The category is changed only for table TABLE, which defaults to
the current buffer's category table.
CHARACTER can be either a single character or a cons representing the
lower and upper ends of an inclusive character range to modify.
If optional fourth argument RESET is non-nil,
then delete CATEGORY from the category set instead of adding it.</p>
<p>
(fn CHARACTER CATEGORY &optional TABLE RESET)<a name="multibyte-string-p"></a>
<h3>Function: multibyte-string-p</h3>

Option VALUE filter for `flycheck-emacs-lisp-package-user-dir'.<a name="sort-paragraphs"></a>
<h3>Function: sort-paragraphs</h3>
Sort paragraphs in region alphabetically; argument means descending order.
Called from a program, there are three arguments:
REVERSE (non-nil means reverse order), BEG and END (region to sort).
The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects
the sort order.</p>
<p>
(fn REVERSE BEG END)<a name="cvs-quickdir"></a>
<h3>Function: cvs-quickdir</h3>
Open a *cvs* buffer on DIR without running cvs.
With a prefix argument, prompt for a directory to use.
A prefix arg >8 (ex: C-u C-u),
  prevents reuse of an existing *cvs* buffer.
Optional argument NOSHOW if non-nil means not to display the buffer.
FLAGS is ignored.</p>

(fn FRAME)<a name="Info-file-supports-index-cookies"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-file-supports-index-cookies</h3>
Return non-nil value if FILE supports Info index cookies.
Info index cookies were first introduced in 4.7, and all later
makeinfo versions output them in index nodes, so we can rely
solely on the makeinfo version.  This function caches the information
in `Info-file-supports-index-cookies-list'.<a name="cl-caaadr"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-caaadr</h3>
Return the `car' of the `car' of the `car' of the `cdr' of X.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: tabulated-list-set-col</h3>
Change the Tabulated List entry at point, setting COL to DESC.
COL is the column number to change, or the name of the column to change.
DESC is the new column descriptor, which is inserted via
`tabulated-list-print-col'.</p>
<p>
If CHANGE-ENTRY-DATA is non-nil, modify the underlying entry data
by setting the appropriate slot of the vector originally used to
print this entry.  If `tabulated-list-entries' has a list value,
this is the vector stored within it.</p>

of the selected frame.<a name="get-buffer-window-list"></a>
<h3>Function: get-buffer-window-list</h3>
Return list of all windows displaying BUFFER-OR-NAME, or nil if none.
BUFFER-OR-NAME may be a buffer or the name of an existing buffer
and defaults to the current buffer.  Windows are scanned starting
with the selected window.</p>
<p>
MINIBUF t means include the minibuffer window even if the
minibuffer is not active.  MINIBUF nil or omitted means include
the minibuffer window only if the minibuffer is active.  Any
other value means do not include the minibuffer window even if
the minibuffer is active.</p>
<p>
ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted means consider all windows on the
selected frame, plus the minibuffer window if specified by the
MINIBUF argument.  If the minibuffer counts, consider all windows
on all frames that share that minibuffer too.  The following
non-nil values of ALL-FRAMES have special meanings:</p>
<p>
- t means consider all windows on all existing frames.</p>
<p>
- `visible' means consider all windows on all visible frames on
  the current terminal.</p>
<p>
- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible
  and iconified frames on the current terminal.</p>
<p>
- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.</p>

Search for a regexp using Isearch only in file names in the Dired buffer.<a name="shell-resync-dirs"></a>
<h3>Function: shell-resync-dirs</h3>
Resync the buffer's idea of the current directory stack.
This command queries the shell with the command bound to
`shell-dirstack-query' (default "dirs"), reads the next
line output and parses it to form the new directory stack.
DON'T issue this command unless the buffer is at a shell prompt.
Also, note that if some other subprocess decides to do output
immediately after the query, its output will be taken as the
new directory stack -- you lose.  If this happens, just do the

<h3>Function: insert-kbd-macro</h3>
Insert in buffer the definition of kbd macro NAME, as Lisp code.
Optional second arg KEYS means also record the keys it is on
(this is the prefix argument, when calling interactively).</p>
<p>
This Lisp code will, when executed, define the kbd macro with the same
definition it has now.  If you say to record the keys, the Lisp code
will also rebind those keys to the macro.  Only global key bindings
are recorded since executing this Lisp code always makes global
bindings.</p>
<p>
To save a kbd macro, visit a file of Lisp code such as your `~/.emacs',
use this command, and then save the file.<a name="autoloadp"></a>
<h3>Function: autoloadp</h3>
Non-nil if OBJECT is an autoload.<a name="process-datagram-address"></a>
<h3>Function: process-datagram-address</h3>
Get the current datagram address associated with PROCESS.</p>
<p>
(fn PROCESS)<a name="set-case-table"></a>
<h3>Function: set-case-table</h3>
Select a new case table for the current buffer.
A case table is a char-table which maps characters
to their lower-case equivalents.  It also has three "extra" slots
which may be additional char-tables or nil.
These slots are called UPCASE, CANONICALIZE and EQUIVALENCES.
UPCASE maps each non-upper-case character to its upper-case equivalent.
 (The value in UPCASE for an upper-case character is never used.)
 If lower and upper case characters are in 1-1 correspondence,
 you may use nil and the upcase table will be deduced from DOWNCASE.
CANONICALIZE maps each character to a canonical equivalent;
 any two characters that are related by case-conversion have the same
 canonical equivalent character; it may be nil, in which case it is
 deduced from DOWNCASE and UPCASE.
EQUIVALENCES is a map that cyclically permutes each equivalence class
 (of characters with the same canonical equivalent); it may be nil,
 in which case it is deduced from CANONICALIZE.</p>
<p>
(fn TABLE)<a name="keymap-parent"></a>
<h3>Function: keymap-parent</h3>
Return the parent keymap of KEYMAP.
If KEYMAP has no parent, return nil.</p>
<p>
(fn KEYMAP)<a name="-sort"></a>
<h3>Function: -sort</h3>

Return the sorted list.  LIST is NOT modified by side effects.
COMPARATOR is called with two elements of LIST, and should return non-nil
if the first element should sort before the second.</p>
<p>
(fn COMPARATOR LIST)<a name="-some?"></a>
<h3>Function: -some?</h3>
Return t if (PRED x) is non-nil for any x in LIST, else nil.</p>
<p>
Alias: `-any-p', `-some?', `-some-p'</p>
<p>
(fn PRED LIST)<a name="open-tls-stream"></a>
<h3>Function: open-tls-stream</h3>
Open a TLS connection for a port to a host.
Returns a subprocess-object to represent the connection.
Input and output work as for subprocesses; `delete-process' closes it.
Args are NAME BUFFER HOST PORT.
NAME is name for process.  It is modified if necessary to make it unique.
BUFFER is the buffer (or buffer name) to associate with the process.
 Process output goes at end of that buffer, unless you specify
 an output stream or filter function to handle the output.
 BUFFER may be also nil, meaning that this process is not associated
 with any buffer
Third arg is name of the host to connect to, or its IP address.
Fourth arg PORT is an integer specifying a port to connect to.<a name="facemenu-set-face"></a>
<h3>Function: facemenu-set-face</h3>
Apply FACE to the region or next character typed.</p>
<p>
If the region is active (normally true except in Transient
Mark mode) and nonempty, and there is no prefix argument,
this command applies FACE to the region.  Otherwise, it applies FACE
to the faces to use for the next character
inserted.  (Moving point or switching buffers before typing
a character to insert cancels the specification.)</p>
<p>
If FACE is `default', to "apply" it means clearing
the list of faces to be used.  For any other value of FACE,
to "apply" it means putting FACE at the front of the list
of faces to be used, and removing any faces further
along in the list that would be completely overridden by
preceding faces (including FACE).</p>
<p>
This command can also add FACE to the menu of faces,
if `facemenu-listed-faces' says to do that.<a name="edit-and-eval-command"></a>
<h3>Function: edit-and-eval-command</h3>
Prompting with PROMPT, let user edit COMMAND and eval result.
COMMAND is a Lisp expression.  Let user edit that expression in
the minibuffer, then read and evaluate the result.<a name="tibetan-char-p"></a>

Return t if OBJECT is a process.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT)<a name="overlays-in"></a>
<h3>Function: overlays-in</h3>
Return a list of the overlays that overlap the region BEG ... END.
Overlap means that at least one character is contained within the overlay
and also contained within the specified region.
Empty overlays are included in the result if they are located at BEG,
between BEG and END, or at END provided END denotes the position at the
end of the buffer.</p>
<p>
(fn BEG END)<a name="auth-source-format-prompt"></a>
<h3>Function: auth-source-format-prompt</h3>
Format PROMPT using %x (for any character x) specifiers in ALIST.<a name="make-instance"></a>
<h3>Function: make-instance</h3>
Make a new instance of CLASS based on INITARGS.
CLASS is a class symbol.  For example:</p>
<p>
  (make-instance 'foo)</p>
<p>
  INITARGS is a property list with keywords based on the :initarg
for each slot.  For example:</p>
<p>
  (make-instance 'foo :slot1 value1 :slotN valueN)</p>
<p>
Compatibility note:</p>
<p>
If the first element of INITARGS is a string, it is used as the
name of the class.</p>
<p>
In EIEIO, the class' constructor requires a name for use when printing.
`make-instance' in CLOS doesn't use names the way Emacs does, so the
class is used as the name slot instead when INITARGS doesn't start with
a string.<a name="dired-uncache"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-uncache</h3>
Remove directory DIR from any directory cache.</p>
<p>
(fn DIR)<a name="cl-gentemp"></a>

<h3>Function: find-variable-at-point</h3>
Find directly the variable at point in the other window.<a name="frame-or-buffer-changed-p"></a>
<h3>Function: frame-or-buffer-changed-p</h3>
Return non-nil if the frame and buffer state appears to have changed.
VARIABLE is a variable name whose value is either nil or a state vector
that will be updated to contain all frames and buffers,
aside from buffers whose names start with space,
along with the buffers' read-only and modified flags.  This allows a fast
check to see whether buffer menus might need to be recomputed.
If this function returns non-nil, it updates the internal vector to reflect
the current state.</p>
<p>
If VARIABLE is nil, an internal variable is used.  Users should not
pass nil for VARIABLE.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional VARIABLE)<a name="get-byte"></a>
<h3>Function: get-byte</h3>

Optional 1st arg POSITION, if non-nil, is a position of a character to get
a byte value.
Optional 2nd arg STRING, if non-nil, is a string of which first
character is a target to get a byte value.  In this case, POSITION, if
non-nil, is an index of a target character in the string.</p>
<p>
If the current buffer (or STRING) is multibyte, and the target
character is not ASCII nor 8-bit character, an error is signaled.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional POSITION STRING)<a name="server-temp-file-p"></a>
<h3>Function: server-temp-file-p</h3>
Return non-nil if BUFFER contains a file considered temporary.
These are files whose names suggest they are repeatedly
reused to pass information to another program.</p>

With a prefix argument ARG, enable GPM Mouse mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
This allows the use of the mouse when operating on a GNU/Linux console,
in the same way as you can use the mouse under X11.
It relies on the `gpm' daemon being activated.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="gv-get"></a>

<p>
(fn)<a name="update-directory-autoloads"></a>
<h3>Function: update-directory-autoloads</h3>
Update autoload definitions for Lisp files in the directories DIRS.
In an interactive call, you must give one argument, the name of a
single directory.  In a call from Lisp, you can supply multiple
directories as separate arguments, but this usage is discouraged.</p>
<p>
The function does NOT recursively descend into subdirectories of the
directory or directories specified.</p>
<p>
In an interactive call, prompt for a default output file for the
autoload definitions, and temporarily bind the variable
`generated-autoload-file' to this value.  When called from Lisp,
use the existing value of `generated-autoload-file'.  If any Lisp
file binds `generated-autoload-file' as a file-local variable,
write its autoloads into the specified file instead.</p>
<p>
(fn &rest DIRS)<a name="read-face-name"></a>
<h3>Function: read-face-name</h3>
Read one or more face names, defaulting to the face(s) at point.
PROMPT should be a prompt string; it should not end in a space or
a colon.</p>
<p>
The optional argument DEFAULT specifies the default face name(s)
to return if the user just types RET.  If its value is non-nil,
it should be a list of face names (symbols); in that case, the
default return value is the `car' of DEFAULT (if the argument
MULTIPLE is non-nil), or DEFAULT (if MULTIPLE is nil).  See below
for the meaning of MULTIPLE.</p>
<p>
If DEFAULT is nil, the list of default face names is taken from
the `read-face-name' property of the text at point, or, if that
is nil, from the `face' property of the text at point.</p>
<p>
This function uses `completing-read-multiple' with "," as the
separator character.  Thus, the user may enter multiple face
names, separated by commas.  The optional argument MULTIPLE
specifies the form of the return value.  If MULTIPLE is non-nil,
return a list of face names; if the user entered just one face
name, the return value would be a list of one face name.
Otherwise, return a single face name; if the user entered more
than one face name, return only the first one.<a name="isearch-query-replace-regexp"></a>

<h3>Function: url-dav-request</h3>
Perform WebDAV operation METHOD on URL.  Return the parsed responses.
Automatically creates an XML request body if TAG is non-nil.
BODY is the XML document fragment to be enclosed by <TAG></TAG>.</p>
<p>
DEPTH is how deep the request should propagate.  Default is 0, meaning
it should apply only to URL.  A negative number means to use
`Infinity' for the depth.  Not all WebDAV servers support this depth
though.</p>
<p>
HEADERS is an assoc list of extra headers to send in the request.</p>
<p>
NAMESPACES is an assoc list of (NAMESPACE . EXPANSION), and these are
added to the <TAG> element.  The DAV=DAV: namespace is automatically
added to this list, so most requests can just pass in nil.</p>

<h3>Function: flycheck-define-generic-checker</h3>
Define SYMBOL as generic syntax checker.</p>
<p>
Any syntax checker defined with this macro is eligible for manual
syntax checker selection with `flycheck-select-checker'.  To make
the new syntax checker available for automatic selection, it must
be registered in `flycheck-checkers'.</p>
<p>
DOCSTRING is the documentation of the syntax checker, for
`flycheck-describe-checker'.  The following PROPERTIES constitute
a generic syntax checker.  Unless otherwise noted, all properties
are mandatory.</p>
<p>
`:start FUNCTION'
     A function to start the syntax checker.</p>
<p>
     FUNCTION shall take two arguments and return a context
     object if the checker is started successfully.  Otherwise it
     shall signal an error.</p>
<p>
     The first argument is the syntax checker being started.  The
     second is a callback function to report state changes to
     Flycheck.  The callback takes two arguments STATUS DATA,
     where STATUS is a symbol denoting the syntax checker status
     and DATA an optional argument with additional data for the
     status report.  See `flycheck-report-buffer-checker-status'
     for more information about STATUS and DATA.</p>
<p>
     FUNCTION may be synchronous or asynchronous, i.e. it may
     call the given callback either immediately, or at some later
     point (e.g. from a process sentinel).</p>
<p>
     A syntax checker _must_ call CALLBACK at least once with a
     STATUS that finishes the current syntax checker.  Otherwise
     Flycheck gets stuck at the current syntax check with this
     syntax checker.</p>
<p>
     The context object returned by FUNCTION is passed to
     `:interrupt'.</p>
<p>
`:interrupt FUNCTION'
     A function to interrupt the syntax check.</p>
<p>
     FUNCTION is called with the syntax checker and the context
     object returned by the `:start' function and shall try to
     interrupt the syntax check.  The context may be nil, if the
     syntax check is interrupted before actually started.
     FUNCTION should handle this situation.</p>
<p>
     If it cannot interrupt the syntax check, it may either
     signal an error or silently ignore the attempt to interrupt
     the syntax checker, depending on the severity of the
     situation.</p>
<p>
     If interrupting the syntax check failed, Flycheck will let
     the syntax check continue, but ignore any status reports.
     Notably, it won't highlight any errors reported by the
     syntax check in the buffer.</p>
<p>
     This property is optional.  If omitted, Flycheck won't
     attempt to interrupt syntax checks wit this syntax checker,
     and simply ignore their results.</p>
<p>
`:print-doc FUNCTION'
     A function to print additional documentation into the Help
     buffer of this checker.</p>
<p>
     FUNCTION is called when creating the Help buffer for the
     syntax checker, with the syntax checker as single argument,
     after printing the name of the syntax checker and its modes
     and predicate, but before printing DOCSTRING.  It may insert
     additional documentation into the current buffer.</p>
<p>
     The call occurs within `with-help-window'.  Hence
     `standard-output' points to the current buffer, so you may
     use `princ' and friends to add content.  Also, the current
     buffer is put into Help mode afterwards, which automatically
     turns symbols into references, if possible.</p>
<p>
     This property is optional.  If omitted, no additional
     documentation is printed for this syntax checker.</p>
<p>
:verify FUNCTION
     A function to verify the checker for the current buffer.</p>
<p>
     FUNCTION is called with the syntax checker as single
     argument, and shall return a list of
     `flycheck-verification-result' objects indicating whether
     the syntax checker could be used in the current buffer, and
     highlighting potential setup problems.</p>
<p>
     This property is optional.  If omitted, no additional
     verification occurs for this syntax checker.  It is however
     absolutely recommended that you add a `:verify' function to
     your syntax checker, because it will help users to spot
     potential setup problems.</p>
<p>
`:modes MODES'
     A major mode symbol or a list thereof, denoting major modes
     to use this syntax checker in.</p>
<p>
     This syntax checker will only be used in buffers whose
     `major-mode' is contained in MODES.</p>
<p>
     If `:predicate' is also given the syntax checker will only
     be used in buffers for which the `:predicate' returns
     non-nil.</p>
<p>
`:predicate FUNCTION'
     A function to determine whether to use the syntax checker in
     the current buffer.</p>
<p>
     FUNCTION is called without arguments and shall return
     non-nil if this syntax checker shall be used to check the
     current buffer.  Otherwise it shall return nil.</p>
<p>
     FUNCTION is only called in matching major modes.</p>
<p>
     This property is optional.</p>
<p>
`:error-filter FUNCTION'
     A function to filter the errors returned by this checker.</p>
<p>
     FUNCTION is called with the list of `flycheck-error' objects
     returned by the syntax checker and shall return another list
     of `flycheck-error' objects, which is considered the final
     result of this syntax checker.</p>
<p>
     FUNCTION is free to add, remove or modify errors, whether in
     place or by copying.</p>
<p>
     This property is optional.  The default filter is
     `identity'.</p>
<p>
`:next-checkers NEXT-CHECKERS'
     A list denoting syntax checkers to apply after this syntax
     checker, in what we call "chaining" of syntax checkers.</p>
<p>
     Each ITEM is a cons cell `(LEVEL . CHECKER)'.  CHECKER is a
     syntax checker to run after this syntax checker.  LEVEL is
     an error level.  CHECKER will only be used if there are no
     current errors of at least LEVEL.  LEVEL may also be t, in
     which case CHECKER is used regardless of the current errors.</p>
<p>
     ITEM may also be a syntax checker symbol, which is
     equivalent to `(t . ITEM)'.</p>
<p>
     Flycheck tries all items in order of declaration, and uses
     the first whose LEVEL matches and whose CHECKER is
     registered and can be used for the current buffer.</p>
<p>
     This feature is typically used to apply more than one syntax
     checker to a buffer.  For instance, you might first use a
     compiler to check a buffer for syntax and type errors, and
     then run a linting tool that checks for insecure code, or
     questionable style.</p>
<p>
     This property is optional.  If omitted, it defaults to the
     nil, i.e. no other syntax checkers are applied after this
     syntax checker.</p>
<p>
`:working-directory FUNCTION'
     The value of `default-directory' when invoking `:start'.</p>
<p>
     FUNCTION is a function taking the syntax checker as sole
     argument.  It shall return the absolute path to an existing
     directory to use as `default-directory' for `:start' or
     nil to fall back to the `default-directory' of the current
     buffer.</p>
<p>
     This property is optional.  If omitted invoke `:start'
     from the `default-directory' of the buffer being checked.</p>
<p>
Signal an error, if any property has an invalid value.<a name="-difference"></a>
<h3>Function: -difference</h3>
Return a new list with only the members of LIST that are not in LIST2.
The test for equality is done with `equal',
or with `-compare-fn' if that's non-nil.</p>
<p>
(fn LIST LIST2)<a name="ert--results-move"></a>
<h3>Function: ert--results-move</h3>
Move point from NODE to the previous or next node.</p>
<p>
EWOC-FN specifies the direction and should be either `ewoc-prev'
or `ewoc-next'.  If there are no more nodes in that direction, an
error is signaled with the message ERROR-MESSAGE.<a name="eieio-defgeneric-form-primary-only"></a>
<h3>Function: eieio-defgeneric-form-primary-only</h3>

<p>
(fn PREDICATE LIST [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="with-electric-help"></a>
<h3>Function: with-electric-help</h3>
Pop up an "electric" help buffer.
THUNK is a function of no arguments which is called to initialize the
contents of BUFFER.  BUFFER defaults to `*Help*'.  BUFFER will be
erased before THUNK is called unless NOERASE is non-nil.  THUNK will
be called while BUFFER is current and with `standard-output' bound to
the buffer specified by BUFFER.</p>
<p>
If THUNK returns nil, we display BUFFER starting at the top, and shrink
the window to fit.  If THUNK returns non-nil, we don't do those things.</p>
<p>
After THUNK has been called, this function "electrically" pops up a
window in which BUFFER is displayed and allows the user to scroll
through that buffer in `electric-help-mode'.  The window's height will
be at least MINHEIGHT if this value is non-nil.</p>
<p>
If THUNK returns nil, we display BUFFER starting at the top, and
shrink the window to fit if `electric-help-shrink-window' is non-nil.
If THUNK returns non-nil, we don't do those things.</p>
<p>
When the user exits (with `electric-help-exit', or otherwise), the help
buffer's window disappears (i.e., we use `save-window-excursion'), and
BUFFER is put back into its original major mode.</p>
<p>
(fn THUNK &optional BUFFER NOERASE MINHEIGHT)<a name="format-encode-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: format-encode-buffer</h3>

<p>
(fn PREDICATE SEQ [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="tool-bar-local-item"></a>
<h3>Function: tool-bar-local-item</h3>
Add an item to the tool bar in map MAP.
ICON names the image, DEF is the key definition and KEY is a symbol
for the fake function key in the menu keymap.  Remaining arguments
PROPS are additional items to add to the menu item specification.  See
Info node `(elisp)Tool Bar'.  Items are added from left to right.</p>
<p>
ICON is the base name of a file containing the image to use.  The
function will first try to use low-color/ICON.xpm if `display-color-cells'
is less or equal to 256, then ICON.xpm, then ICON.pbm, and finally
ICON.xbm, using `find-image'.<a name="x-must-resolve-font-name"></a>
<h3>Function: x-must-resolve-font-name</h3>
Like `x-resolve-font-name', but always return a font name.
XLFD-FIELDS is a vector of XLFD (X Logical Font Description) fields.
If no font matching XLFD-FIELDS is available, successively replace
parts of the font name pattern with "*" until some font is found.
Value is name of that font.<a name="locale-name-match"></a>
<h3>Function: locale-name-match</h3>

<h3>Function: mml-attach-file</h3>
Attach a file to the outgoing MIME message.
The file is not inserted or encoded until you send the message with
`M-x message-send-and-exit' or `M-x message-send' in Message mode,
or `M-x mail-send-and-exit' or `M-x mail-send' in Mail mode.</p>
<p>
FILE is the name of the file to attach.  TYPE is its
content-type, a string of the form "type/subtype".  DESCRIPTION
is a one-line description of the attachment.  The DISPOSITION
specifies how the attachment is intended to be displayed.  It can

body) or "attachment" (separate from the body).</p>
<p>
(fn FILE &optional TYPE DESCRIPTION DISPOSITION)<a name="scroll-down"></a>
<h3>Function: scroll-down</h3>
Scroll text of selected window down ARG lines.
If ARG is omitted or nil, scroll down by a near full screen.
A near full screen is `next-screen-context-lines' less than a full screen.
Negative ARG means scroll upward.
If ARG is the atom `-', scroll upward by nearly full screen.
When calling from a program, supply as argument a number, nil, or `-'.</p>
<p>

<p>
(fn PRED LIST)<a name="ucs-insert"></a>
<h3>Function: ucs-insert</h3>
Insert COUNT copies of CHARACTER.
Interactively, prompt for CHARACTER.  You can specify CHARACTER in one
of these ways:</p>
<p>
 - As its Unicode character name, e.g. "LATIN SMALL LETTER A".
   Completion is available; if you type a substring of the name
   preceded by an asterisk `*', Emacs shows all names which include
   that substring, not necessarily at the beginning of the name.</p>
<p>
 - As a hexadecimal code point, e.g. 263A.  Note that code points in
   Emacs are equivalent to Unicode up to 10FFFF (which is the limit of
   the Unicode code space).</p>
<p>
 - As a code point with a radix specified with #, e.g. #o21430
   (octal), #x2318 (hex), or #10r8984 (decimal).</p>
<p>
If called interactively, COUNT is given by the prefix argument.  If
omitted or nil, it defaults to 1.</p>
<p>
Inserting the character(s) relocates point and before-insertion
markers in the same ways as the function `insert'.</p>
<p>
The optional third argument INHERIT, if non-nil, says to inherit text
properties from adjoining text, if those properties are sticky.  If
called interactively, INHERIT is t.</p>
<p>
(fn CHARACTER &optional COUNT INHERIT)<a name="unload-feature"></a>
<h3>Function: unload-feature</h3>
Unload the library that provided FEATURE.
If the feature is required by any other loaded code, and prefix arg FORCE
is nil, raise an error.</p>
<p>
Standard unloading activities include restoring old autoloads for
functions defined by the library, undoing any additions that the
library has made to hook variables or to `auto-mode-alist', undoing
ELP profiling of functions in that library, unproviding any features
provided by the library, and canceling timers held in variables
defined by the library.</p>
<p>
If a function `FEATURE-unload-function' is defined, this function
calls it with no arguments, before doing anything else.  That function
can do whatever is appropriate to undo the loading of the library.  If
`FEATURE-unload-function' returns non-nil, that suppresses the
standard unloading of the library.  Otherwise the standard unloading
proceeds.</p>
<p>
`FEATURE-unload-function' has access to the package's list of
definitions in the variable `unload-function-defs-list' and could
remove symbols from it in the event that the package has done
something strange, such as redefining an Emacs function.</p>
<p>
(fn FEATURE &optional FORCE)<a name="isearchb-activate"></a>
<h3>Function: isearchb-activate</h3>
Active isearchb mode for subsequent alphanumeric keystrokes.

Search for a usable window, set that window to the buffer, and
return the window.  If no suitable window is found, return nil.</p>
<p>
If ALIST has a non-nil `inhibit-switch-frame' entry, then in the
event that a window in another frame is chosen, avoid raising
that frame.<a name="flycheck-error-level-interesting-at-pos-p"></a>

Set the background COLOR of the region or next character typed.
This command reads the color in the minibuffer.</p>
<p>
If the region is active (normally true except in Transient Mark mode)
and there is no prefix argument, this command sets the region to the
requested face.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, this command specifies the face for the next character
inserted.  Moving point or switching buffers before
typing a character to insert cancels the specification.<a name="edirs3"></a>
<h3>Function: edirs3</h3>
Run Ediff on three directories, DIR1, DIR2, and DIR3, comparing files that
have the same name in all three.  The last argument, REGEXP, is nil or a

(fn DIR1 DIR2 DIR3 REGEXP)<a name="flycheck-error-list-make-cell"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-error-list-make-cell</h3>
Make an error list cell with TEXT and FACE.</p>
<p>
If FACE is nil don't set a FACE on TEXT.  If TEXT already has
face properties, do not specify a FACE.  Note though, that if
TEXT gets truncated it will not inherit any previous face
properties.  If you expect TEXT to be truncated in the error
list, do specify a FACE explicitly!<a name="nato-region"></a>

If `cannot-suspend' is non-nil, or if the system doesn't support job
control, run a subshell instead.</p>
<p>
If optional arg STUFFSTRING is non-nil, its characters are stuffed
to be read as terminal input by Emacs's parent, after suspension.</p>
<p>
Before suspending, run the normal hook `suspend-hook'.
After resumption run the normal hook `suspend-resume-hook'.</p>
<p>
Some operating systems cannot stop the Emacs process and resume it later.
On such systems, Emacs starts a subshell instead of suspending.</p>

<p>
(fn &optional FILE STARTUP-HOOKS MERGE-BUFFER-FILE)<a name="mouse-avoidance-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: mouse-avoidance-mode</h3>
Set Mouse Avoidance mode to MODE.
MODE should be one of the symbols `banish', `exile', `jump', `animate',
`cat-and-mouse', `proteus', or `none'.</p>
<p>
If MODE is nil, toggle mouse avoidance between `none' and `banish'
modes.  Positive numbers and symbols other than the above are treated
as equivalent to `banish'; negative numbers and `-' are equivalent to `none'.</p>
<p>
Effects of the different modes:
 * banish: Move the mouse to the upper-right corner on any keypress.
 * exile: Move the mouse to the corner only if the cursor gets too close,
     and allow it to return once the cursor is out of the way.
 * jump: If the cursor gets too close to the mouse, displace the mouse
     a random distance & direction.
 * animate: As `jump', but shows steps along the way for illusion of motion.
 * cat-and-mouse: Same as `animate'.
 * proteus: As `animate', but changes the shape of the mouse pointer too.</p>
<p>
Whenever the mouse is moved, the frame is also raised.</p>
<p>
(See `mouse-avoidance-threshold' for definition of "too close",
and `mouse-avoidance-nudge-dist' and `mouse-avoidance-nudge-var' for
definition of "random distance".)</p>

Completion is available for color names, but not for RGB triplets.</p>
<p>
RGB triplets have the form "#RRGGBB".  Each of the R, G, and B
components can have one to four digits, but all three components
must have the same number of digits.  Each digit is a hex value
between 0 and F; either upper case or lower case for A through F
are acceptable.</p>
<p>
In addition to standard color names and RGB hex values, the
following are available as color candidates.  In each case, the

<h3>Function: regexp-opt</h3>
Return a regexp to match a string in the list STRINGS.
Each string should be unique in STRINGS and should not contain any regexps,
quoted or not.  If optional PAREN is non-nil, ensure that the returned regexp
is enclosed by at least one regexp grouping construct.
The returned regexp is typically more efficient than the equivalent regexp:</p>
<p>

<p>
(fn &optional TAKE-NOTES)<a name="bibtex-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: bibtex-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing BibTeX files.</p>
<p>
General information on working with BibTeX mode:</p>
<p>
Use commands such as 
Uses keymap `bibtex-mode-map', which is not currently defined.
M-x bibtex-Book to get a template for a specific entry.
Then fill in all desired fields using M-x bibtex-next-field to jump from field
to field.  After having filled in all desired fields in the entry, clean the
new entry with the command M-x bibtex-clean-entry.</p>
<p>
Some features of BibTeX mode are available only by setting the variable
`bibtex-maintain-sorted-entries' to non-nil.  However, then BibTeX mode
works only with buffers containing valid (syntactically correct) and sorted
entries.  This is usually the case, if you have created a buffer completely
with BibTeX mode and finished every new entry with M-x bibtex-clean-entry.</p>
<p>
For third party BibTeX files, call the command M-x bibtex-convert-alien
to fully take advantage of all features of BibTeX mode.</p>
<p>

Special information:</p>
<p>
A command such as M-x bibtex-Book outlines the fields for a BibTeX book entry.</p>
<p>
The names of optional fields start with the string OPT, and are thus ignored
by BibTeX.  The names of alternative fields from which only one is required
start with the string ALT.  The OPT or ALT string may be removed from
the name of a field with M-x bibtex-remove-OPT-or-ALT.
M-x bibtex-make-field inserts a new field after the current one.
M-x bibtex-kill-field kills the current field entirely.
M-x bibtex-yank yanks the last recently killed field after the current field.
M-x bibtex-remove-delimiters removes the double-quotes or braces around the text of the current field.
M-x bibtex-empty-field replaces the text of the current field with the default "" or {}.
M-x bibtex-find-text moves point to the end of the current field.
M-x completion-at-point completes word fragment before point according to context.</p>
<p>
The command M-x bibtex-clean-entry cleans the current entry, i.e. it removes OPT/ALT
from the names of all non-empty optional or alternative fields, checks that
no required fields are empty, and does some formatting dependent on the value
of `bibtex-entry-format'.  Furthermore, it can automatically generate a key
for the BibTeX entry, see `bibtex-generate-autokey'.
Note: some functions in BibTeX mode depend on entries being in a special
format (all fields beginning on separate lines), so it is usually a bad
idea to remove `realign' from `bibtex-entry-format'.</p>
<p>
BibTeX mode supports Imenu and hideshow minor mode (`hs-minor-mode').</p>
<p>
----------------------------------------------------------
Entry to BibTeX mode calls the value of `bibtex-mode-hook'
if that value is non-nil.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `bibtex-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>

Second argument TOTAL-SIZE specifies the number of lines or columns of the
new window.  In any case TOTAL-SIZE must be a positive integer.</p>
<p>
Third argument SIDE nil (or `below') specifies that the new window shall
be located below WINDOW.  SIDE `above' means the new window shall be
located above WINDOW.  In both cases TOTAL-SIZE specifies the number of
lines of the new window including space reserved for the mode and/or
header line.</p>
<p>
SIDE t (or `right') specifies that the new window shall be located on
the right side of WINDOW.  SIDE `left' means the new window shall be
located on the left of WINDOW.  In both cases TOTAL-SIZE specifies the
number of columns of the new window including space reserved for fringes
and the scrollbar or a divider column.</p>
<p>
Fourth argument NORMAL-SIZE specifies the normal size of the new window
according to the SIDE argument.</p>

(fn OLD TOTAL-SIZE SIDE NORMAL-SIZE)<a name="aset"></a>
<h3>Function: aset</h3>
Store into the element of ARRAY at index IDX the value NEWELT.
Return NEWELT.  ARRAY may be a vector, a string, a char-table or a
bool-vector.  IDX starts at 0.</p>
<p>
(fn ARRAY IDX NEWELT)<a name="whitespace-report-region"></a>
<h3>Function: whitespace-report-region</h3>
Report some whitespace problems in a region.</p>
<p>
Return nil if there is no whitespace problem; otherwise, return
non-nil.</p>
<p>
If FORCE is non-nil or C-u was pressed just
before calling `whitespace-report-region' interactively, it
forces `whitespace-style' to have:</p>
<p>
   empty
   indentation
   space-before-tab
   trailing
   space-after-tab</p>
<p>
If REPORT-IF-BOGUS is non-nil, it reports only when there are any
whitespace problems in buffer.</p>
<p>
Report if some of the following whitespace problems exist:</p>
<p>
* If `indent-tabs-mode' is non-nil:
   empty		1. empty lines at beginning of buffer.
   empty		2. empty lines at end of buffer.
   trailing		3. SPACEs or TABs at end of line.
   indentation		4. 8 or more SPACEs at beginning of line.
   space-before-tab	5. SPACEs before TAB.
   space-after-tab	6. 8 or more SPACEs after TAB.</p>
<p>
* If `indent-tabs-mode' is nil:
   empty		1. empty lines at beginning of buffer.
   empty		2. empty lines at end of buffer.
   trailing		3. SPACEs or TABs at end of line.
   indentation		4. TABS at beginning of line.
   space-before-tab	5. SPACEs before TAB.
   space-after-tab	6. 8 or more SPACEs after TAB.</p>

See `whitespace-style' for documentation.
See also `whitespace-cleanup' and `whitespace-cleanup-region' for
cleaning up these problems.</p>
<p>
(fn START END &optional FORCE REPORT-IF-BOGUS)<a name="savehist-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: savehist-mode</h3>
Toggle saving of minibuffer history (Savehist mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Savehist mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When Savehist mode is enabled, minibuffer history is saved
periodically and when exiting Emacs.  When Savehist mode is
enabled for the first time in an Emacs session, it loads the
previous minibuffer history from `savehist-file'.</p>
<p>
This mode should normally be turned on from your Emacs init file.
Calling it at any other time replaces your current minibuffer
histories, which is probably undesirable.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="forms-find-file"></a>
<h3>Function: forms-find-file</h3>
Visit a file in Forms mode.</p>
<p>
(fn FN)<a name="user-error"></a>
<h3>Function: user-error</h3>
Signal a pilot error, making error message by passing all args to `format'.
In Emacs, the convention is that error messages start with a capital
letter but *do not* end with a period.  Please follow this convention
for the sake of consistency.
This is just like `error' except that `user-error's are expected to be the
result of an incorrect manipulation on the part of the user, rather than the
result of an actual problem.<a name="ert-face-for-test-result"></a>
<h3>Function: ert-face-for-test-result</h3>
Return a face that shows whether a test result was expected or unexpected.</p>
<p>
If EXPECTEDP is nil, returns the face for unexpected results; if
non-nil, returns the face for expected results..<a name="diff-post-command-hook"></a>
<h3>Function: diff-post-command-hook</h3>
Fixup hunk headers if necessary.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="windmove-down"></a>
<h3>Function: windmove-down</h3>
Select the window below the current one.
With no prefix argument, or with prefix argument equal to zero,
"down" is relative to the position of point in the window; otherwise
it is relative to the left edge (for positive ARG) or the right edge
(for negative ARG) of the current window.
If no window is at the desired location, an error is signaled.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="kill-buffer-ask"></a>
<h3>Function: kill-buffer-ask</h3>
Kill BUFFER if confirmed.<a name="bobp"></a>
<h3>Function: bobp</h3>
Return t if point is at the beginning of the buffer.
If the buffer is narrowed, this means the beginning of the narrowed part.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="widget-type"></a>
<h3>Function: widget-type</h3>
Return the type of WIDGET.  The type is a symbol.</p>
<p>
(fn WIDGET)<a name="Info-apropos-toc-nodes"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-apropos-toc-nodes</h3>
Apropos-specific implementation of `Info-toc-nodes'.<a name="kmacro-display"></a>
<h3>Function: kmacro-display</h3>
Display a keyboard MACRO.
Optional arg TRUNC non-nil specifies to limit width of macro to 60 chars.
Optional arg DESCR is descriptive text for macro; default is "Macro:".
Optional arg EMPTY is message to print if no macros are defined.<a name="gdb"></a>
<h3>Function: gdb</h3>
Run gdb on program FILE in buffer *gud-FILE*.
The directory containing FILE becomes the initial working directory
and source-file directory for your debugger.</p>
<p>
COMMAND-LINE is the shell command for starting the gdb session.
It should be a string consisting of the name of the gdb
executable followed by command-line options.  The command-line
options should include "-i=mi" to use gdb's MI text interface.
Note that the old "--annotate" option is no longer supported.</p>
<p>
If `gdb-many-windows' is nil (the default value) then gdb just
pops up the GUD buffer unless `gdb-show-main' is t.  In this case
it starts with two windows: one displaying the GUD buffer and the
other with the source file with the main routine of the inferior.</p>
<p>
If `gdb-many-windows' is t, regardless of the value of
`gdb-show-main', the layout below will appear.  Keybindings are
shown in some of the buffers.</p>
<p>
Watch expressions appear in the speedbar/slowbar.</p>
<p>
The following commands help control operation :</p>
<p>
`gdb-many-windows'    - Toggle the number of windows gdb uses.
`gdb-restore-windows' - To restore the window layout.</p>
<p>
See Info node `(emacs)GDB Graphical Interface' for a more
detailed description of this mode.</p>

(fn COMMAND-LINE)<a name="window-body-width"></a>
<h3>Function: window-body-width</h3>
Return the width, in columns, of WINDOW's text area.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
The return value does not include any vertical dividers, fringe or
marginal areas, or scroll bars.  On a graphical display, the width is
expressed as an integer multiple of the default character width.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WINDOW)<a name="frame-pixel-height"></a>
<h3>Function: frame-pixel-height</h3>
Return a FRAME's height in pixels.
If FRAME is omitted, the selected frame is used.  The exact value
of the result depends on the window-system and toolkit in use:</p>
<p>
In the Gtk+ version of Emacs, it includes only any window (including
the minibuffer or echo area), mode line, and header line.  It does not
include the tool bar or menu bar.</p>
<p>
With other graphical versions, it also includes the tool bar and the
menu bar.</p>
<p>
For a text terminal, it includes the menu bar.  In this case, the
result is really in characters rather than pixels (i.e., is identical
to `frame-height').</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FRAME)<a name="jka-compr-get-compression-info"></a>
<h3>Function: jka-compr-get-compression-info</h3>
Return information about the compression scheme of FILENAME.
The determination as to which compression scheme, if any, to use is

<p>

(fn WIDGET)<a name="-intersection"></a>
<h3>Function: -intersection</h3>
Return a new list containing only the elements that are members of both LIST and LIST2.
The test for equality is done with `equal',
or with `-compare-fn' if that's non-nil.</p>
<p>
(fn LIST LIST2)<a name="url-cache-create-filename-human-readable"></a>
<h3>Function: url-cache-create-filename-human-readable</h3>
Return a filename in the local cache for URL.<a name="byte-compile-top-level-body"></a>

<h3>Function: woman-find-file</h3>
Find, decode and browse a specific UN*X man-page source file FILE-NAME.
Use existing buffer if possible; reformat only if prefix arg given.
When called interactively, optional argument REFORMAT forces reformatting
of an existing WoMan buffer formatted earlier.
No external programs are used, except that `gunzip' will be used to
decompress the file if appropriate.  See the documentation for the
`woman' command for further details.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE-NAME &optional REFORMAT)<a name="gravatar-retrieve"></a>
<h3>Function: gravatar-retrieve</h3>
Retrieve MAIL-ADDRESS gravatar and call CB on retrieval.
You can provide a list of argument to pass to CB in CBARGS.</p>

<h3>Function: cl-caaaar</h3>
Return the `car' of the `car' of the `car' of the `car' of X.</p>
<p>
(fn X)<a name="canonically-space-region"></a>
<h3>Function: canonically-space-region</h3>
Remove extra spaces between words in region.
Leave one space between words, two at end of sentences or after colons
(depending on values of `sentence-end-double-space', `colon-double-space',
and `sentence-end-without-period').
Remove indentation from each line.<a name="compose-last-chars"></a>
<h3>Function: compose-last-chars</h3>
Compose last characters.
The argument is a parameterized event of the form
	(compose-last-chars N COMPONENTS),
where N is the number of characters before point to compose,
COMPONENTS, if non-nil, is the same as the argument to `compose-region'
(which see).  If it is nil, `compose-chars-after' is called,
and that function finds a proper rule to compose the target characters.
This function is intended to be used from input methods.
The global keymap binds special event `compose-last-chars' to this
function.  Input method may generate an event (compose-last-chars N COMPONENTS)
after a sequence of character events.<a name="current-word"></a>
<h3>Function: current-word</h3>
Return the symbol or word that point is on (or a nearby one) as a string.
The return value includes no text properties.
If optional arg STRICT is non-nil, return nil unless point is within
or adjacent to a symbol or word.  In all cases the value can be nil
if there is no word nearby.
The function, belying its name, normally finds a symbol.
If optional arg REALLY-WORD is non-nil, it finds just a word.<a name="gnus-group-split"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-group-split</h3>
Use information from group parameters in order to split mail.
See `gnus-group-split-fancy' for more information.</p>
<p>
`gnus-group-split' is a valid value for `nnmail-split-methods'.</p>

<p>
(fn OBJECT)<a name="eieio-set-defaults"></a>
<h3>Function: eieio-set-defaults</h3>
Take object OBJ, and reset all slots to their defaults.
If SET-ALL is non-nil, then when a default is nil, that value is
reset.  If SET-ALL is nil, the slots are only reset if the default is
not nil.<a name="help-fns--signature"></a>
<h3>Function: help-fns--signature</h3></p>
<p>

(fn FUNCTION DOC REAL-DEF REAL-FUNCTION)<a name="url-register-auth-scheme"></a>
<h3>Function: url-register-auth-scheme</h3>
Register an HTTP authentication method.</p>
<p>
TYPE     is a string or symbol specifying the name of the method.
         This should be the same thing you expect to get returned in
         an Authenticate header in HTTP/1.0 - it will be downcased.
FUNCTION is the function to call to get the authorization information.
         This defaults to `url-?-auth', where ? is TYPE.
RATING   a rating between 1 and 10 of the strength of the authentication.
         This is used when asking for the best authentication for a specific
         URL.  The item with the highest rating is returned.<a name="ediff-windows-linewise"></a>
<h3>Function: ediff-windows-linewise</h3>
Compare WIND-A and WIND-B, which are selected by clicking, linewise.
With prefix argument, DUMB-MODE, or on a non-windowing display, works as
follows:
If WIND-A is nil, use selected window.
If WIND-B is nil, use window next to WIND-A.</p>
<p>
(fn DUMB-MODE &optional WIND-A WIND-B STARTUP-HOOKS)<a name="align-highlight-rule"></a>
<h3>Function: align-highlight-rule</h3>
Highlight the whitespace which a given rule would have modified.
BEG and END mark the extent of the region.  TITLE identifies the rule
that should be highlighted.  If RULES or EXCLUDE-RULES is set to a
list of rules (see `align-rules-list'), it can be used to override the
default alignment rules that would have been used to identify the text
to be colored.</p>
<p>
(fn BEG END TITLE &optional RULES EXCLUDE-RULES)<a name="point-at-bol"></a>
<h3>Function: point-at-bol</h3>
Return the character position of the first character on the current line.
With optional argument N, scan forward N - 1 lines first.
If the scan reaches the end of the buffer, return that position.</p>
<p>
This function ignores text display directionality; it returns the
position of the first character in logical order, i.e. the smallest
character position on the line.</p>
<p>
This function constrains the returned position to the current field
unless that position would be on a different line than the original,
unconstrained result.  If N is nil or 1, and a front-sticky field
starts at point, the scan stops as soon as it starts.  To ignore field
boundaries, bind `inhibit-field-text-motion' to t.</p>
<p>
This function does not move point.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional N)<a name="flycheck-relevant-errors"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-relevant-errors</h3>
Filter the relevant errors from ERRORS.</p>
<p>
Return a list of all errors that are relevant for their
corresponding buffer.<a name="word-search-regexp"></a>
<h3>Function: word-search-regexp</h3>
Return a regexp which matches words, ignoring punctuation.
Given STRING, a string of words separated by word delimiters,
compute a regexp that matches those exact words separated by
arbitrary punctuation.  If LAX is non-nil, the end of the string
need not match a word boundary unless it ends in whitespace.</p>
<p>
Used in `word-search-forward', `word-search-backward',
`word-search-forward-lax', `word-search-backward-lax'.<a name="pop3-movemail"></a>
<h3>Function: pop3-movemail</h3>
Transfer contents of a maildrop to the specified FILE.
Use streaming commands.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE)<a name="list-tags"></a>
<h3>Function: list-tags</h3>
Display list of tags in file FILE.
This searches only the first table in the list, and no included tables.
FILE should be as it appeared in the `etags' command, usually without a
directory specification.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE &optional NEXT-MATCH)<a name="epatch"></a>
<h3>Function: epatch</h3>
Query for a file name, and then run Ediff by patching that file.
If optional PATCH-BUF is given, use the patch in that buffer
and don't ask the user.
If prefix argument, then: if even argument, assume that the patch is in a
buffer. If odd -- assume it is in a file.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG PATCH-BUF)<a name="full-calc"></a>
<h3>Function: full-calc</h3>
Invoke the Calculator and give it a full-sized window.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional INTERACTIVE)<a name="set-auto-mode-1"></a>
<h3>Function: set-auto-mode-1</h3>
Find the -*- spec in the buffer.
Call with point at the place to start searching from.
If one is found, set point to the beginning and return the position
of the end.  Otherwise, return nil; may change point.
The variable `inhibit-local-variables-regexps' can cause a -*- spec to
be ignored; but `enable-local-variables' and `local-enable-local-variables'
have no effect.<a name="eval-after-load"></a>
<h3>Function: eval-after-load</h3>
Arrange that if FILE is loaded, FORM will be run immediately afterwards.
If FILE is already loaded, evaluate FORM right now.</p>
<p>
If a matching file is loaded again, FORM will be evaluated again.</p>
<p>
If FILE is a string, it may be either an absolute or a relative file
name, and may have an extension (e.g. ".el") or may lack one, and
additionally may or may not have an extension denoting a compressed
format (e.g. ".gz").</p>
<p>
When FILE is absolute, this first converts it to a true name by chasing
symbolic links.  Only a file of this name (see next paragraph regarding
extensions) will trigger the evaluation of FORM.  When FILE is relative,
a file whose absolute true name ends in FILE will trigger evaluation.</p>
<p>
When FILE lacks an extension, a file name with any extension will trigger
evaluation.  Otherwise, its extension must match FILE's.  A further
extension for a compressed format (e.g. ".gz") on FILE will not affect
this name matching.</p>
<p>
Alternatively, FILE can be a feature (i.e. a symbol), in which case FORM
is evaluated at the end of any file that `provide's this feature.
If the feature is provided when evaluating code not associated with a
file, FORM is evaluated immediately after the provide statement.</p>
<p>
Usually FILE is just a library name like "font-lock" or a feature name
like 'font-lock.</p>
<p>
This function makes or adds to an entry on `after-load-alist'.<a name="tty-display-color-cells"></a>
<h3>Function: tty-display-color-cells</h3>
Return the number of colors supported by the tty device TERMINAL.</p>
<p>
TERMINAL can be a terminal object, a frame, or nil (meaning the
selected frame's terminal).  This function always returns 0 if
TERMINAL does not refer to a text terminal.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional TERMINAL)<a name="ewoc-get-hf"></a>
<h3>Function: ewoc-get-hf</h3>
Return a cons cell containing the (HEADER . FOOTER) of EWOC.</p>
<p>
(fn EWOC)<a name="set-auto-mode-0"></a>
<h3>Function: set-auto-mode-0</h3>
Apply MODE and return it.
If optional arg KEEP-MODE-IF-SAME is non-nil, MODE is chased of
any aliases and compared to current major mode.  If they are the
same, do nothing and return nil.<a name="unhighlight-regexp"></a>
<h3>Function: unhighlight-regexp</h3>
Remove highlighting of each match to REGEXP set by hi-lock.
Interactively, prompt for REGEXP, accepting only regexps
previously inserted by hi-lock interactive functions.</p>
<p>
(fn REGEXP)<a name="customize-push-and-save"></a>
<h3>Function: customize-push-and-save</h3>
Add ELTS to LIST-VAR and save for future sessions, safely.
ELTS should be a list.  This function adds each entry to the
value of LIST-VAR using `add-to-list'.</p>
<p>
If Emacs is initialized, call `customize-save-variable' to save
the resulting list value now.  Otherwise, add an entry to
`after-init-hook' to save it after initialization.<a name="class-of"></a>
<h3>Function: class-of</h3>
Return the class struct defining OBJ.<a name="rmail"></a>
<h3>Function: rmail</h3>
Read and edit incoming mail.
Moves messages into file named by `rmail-file-name' and edits that
file in RMAIL Mode.
Type C-h m once editing that file, for a list of RMAIL commands.</p>
<p>
May be called with file name as argument; then performs rmail editing on
that file, but does not copy any new mail into the file.
Interactively, if you supply a prefix argument, then you
have a chance to specify a file name with the minibuffer.</p>
<p>
If `rmail-display-summary' is non-nil, make a summary for this RMAIL file.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FILE-NAME-ARG)<a name="quail-use-package"></a>
<h3>Function: quail-use-package</h3>
Start using Quail package PACKAGE-NAME.
The remaining arguments are LIBRARIES to be loaded before using the package.</p>
<p>
This activates input method defined by PACKAGE-NAME by running
`quail-activate', which see.</p>
<p>
(fn PACKAGE-NAME &rest LIBRARIES)<a name="find-file-literally"></a>
<h3>Function: find-file-literally</h3>
Visit file FILENAME with no conversion of any kind.
Format conversion and character code conversion are both disabled,
and multibyte characters are disabled in the resulting buffer.
The major mode used is Fundamental mode regardless of the file name,
and local variable specifications in the file are ignored.
Automatic uncompression and adding a newline at the end of the
file due to `require-final-newline' is also disabled.</p>
<p>
You cannot absolutely rely on this function to result in
visiting the file literally.  If Emacs already has a buffer
which is visiting the file, you get the existing buffer,
regardless of whether it was created literally or not.</p>
<p>
In a Lisp program, if you want to be sure of accessing a file's
contents literally, you should create a temporary buffer and then read
the file contents into it using `insert-file-contents-literally'.<a name="rx-info"></a>
<h3>Function: rx-info</h3>
Return parsing/code generation info for OP.
If OP is the space character ASCII 32, return info for the symbol `?'.
If OP is the character `?', return info for the symbol `??'.
See also `rx-constituents'.
If HEAD is non-nil, then OP is the head of a sexp, otherwise it's
a standalone symbol.<a name="gnus-make-predicate"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-make-predicate</h3>
Transform SPEC into a function that can be called.
SPEC is a predicate specifier that contains stuff like `or', `and',
`not', lists and functions.  The functions all take one parameter.<a name="mm-charset-after"></a>
<h3>Function: mm-charset-after</h3>
Return charset of a character in current buffer at position POS.
If POS is nil, it defaults to the current point.
If POS is out of range, the value is nil.
If the charset is `composition', return the actual one.<a name="Info-unescape-quotes"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-unescape-quotes</h3>
Unescape double quotes and backslashes in VALUE.<a name="cl-copy-list"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-copy-list</h3>
Return a copy of LIST, which may be a dotted list.
The elements of LIST are not copied, just the list structure itself.</p>
<p>
(fn LIST)<a name="buffer-menu"></a>
<h3>Function: buffer-menu</h3>
Switch to the Buffer Menu.
By default, the Buffer Menu lists all buffers except those whose
names start with a space (which are for internal use).  With
prefix argument ARG, show only buffers that are visiting files.</p>
<p>
In the Buffer Menu, the first column (denoted "C") shows "."
for the buffer from which you came, ">" for buffers you mark to
be displayed, and "D" for those you mark for deletion.</p>
<p>
The "R" column has a "%" if the buffer is read-only.
The "M" column has a "*" if it is modified, or "S" if you
have marked it for saving.</p>
<p>
The remaining columns show the buffer name, the buffer size in
characters, its major mode, and the visited file name (if any).</p>
<p>
See `Buffer-menu-mode' for the keybindings available the Buffer
Menu.<a name="executable-command-find-posix-p"></a>
<h3>Function: executable-command-find-posix-p</h3>
Check if PROGRAM handles arguments Posix-style.
If PROGRAM is non-nil, use that instead of "find".</p>
<p>
(fn &optional PROGRAM)<a name="sql-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: sql-mode</h3>
Major mode to edit SQL.</p>
<p>
You can send SQL statements to the SQLi buffer using
M-x sql-send-region.  Such a buffer must exist before you can do this.
See `sql-help' on how to create SQLi buffers.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `sql-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
Customization: Entry to this mode runs the `sql-mode-hook'.</p>
<p>
When you put a buffer in SQL mode, the buffer stores the last SQLi
buffer created as its destination in the variable `sql-buffer'.  This
will be the buffer M-x sql-send-region sends the region to.  If this
SQLi buffer is killed, M-x sql-send-region is no longer able to
determine where the strings should be sent to.  You can set the
value of `sql-buffer' using M-x sql-set-sqli-buffer.</p>
<p>
For information on how to create multiple SQLi buffers, see
`sql-interactive-mode'.</p>
<p>
Note that SQL doesn't have an escape character unless you specify
one.  If you specify backslash as escape character in SQL, you
must tell Emacs.  Here's how to do that in your init file:</p>
<p>
(add-hook 'sql-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
	    (modify-syntax-entry ?\\ "." sql-mode-syntax-table)))</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="char-before"></a>
<h3>Function: char-before</h3>
Return character in current buffer preceding position POS.
POS is an integer or a marker and defaults to point.
If POS is out of range, the value is nil.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional POS)<a name="byte-optimize-form"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-optimize-form</h3>
The source-level pass of the optimizer.</p>
<p>
(fn FORM &optional FOR-EFFECT)<a name="dired-safe-switches-p"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-safe-switches-p</h3>
Return non-nil if string SWITCHES does not look risky for dired.</p>
<p>
(fn SWITCHES)<a name="ansi-color-apply-on-region"></a>
<h3>Function: ansi-color-apply-on-region</h3>
Translates SGR control sequences into overlays or extents.
Delete all other control sequences without processing them.</p>
<p>
SGR control sequences are applied by calling the function
specified by `ansi-color-apply-face-function'.  The default
function sets foreground and background colors to the text
between BEGIN and END, using overlays.  The colors used are given
in `ansi-color-faces-vector' and `ansi-color-names-vector'.  See
`ansi-color-apply-sequence' for details.</p>
<p>
Every call to this function will set and use the buffer-local
variable `ansi-color-context-region' to save position and current
ansi codes.  This information will be used for the next call to
`ansi-color-apply-on-region'.  Specifically, it will override
BEGIN, the start of the region and set the face with which to
start.  Set `ansi-color-context-region' to nil if you don't want
this.<a name="highlight-changes-remove-highlight"></a>
<h3>Function: highlight-changes-remove-highlight</h3>
Remove the change face from the region between BEG and END.
This allows you to manually remove highlighting from uninteresting changes.</p>
<p>
(fn BEG END)<a name="map"></a>
<h3>Function: map</h3>

<h3>Function: cl-expand-do-loop</h3></p>
<p>

(fn STEPS ENDTEST BODY STAR)<a name="scroll-all-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: scroll-all-mode</h3>
Toggle shared scrolling in same-frame windows (Scroll-All mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Scroll-All mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When Scroll-All mode is enabled, scrolling commands invoked in
one window apply to all visible windows in the same frame.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="reftex-all-document-files"></a>
<h3>Function: reftex-all-document-files</h3>
Return a list of all files belonging to the current document.

<h3>Function: org-babel-do-load-languages</h3>
Load the languages defined in `org-babel-load-languages'.</p>
<p>
(fn SYM VALUE)<a name="man"></a>
<h3>Function: man</h3>
Get a Un*x manual page and put it in a buffer.
This command is the top-level command in the man package.  It
runs a Un*x command to retrieve and clean a manpage in the
background and places the results in a `Man-mode' browsing
buffer.  See variable `Man-notify-method' for what happens when
the buffer is ready.  If a buffer already exists for this man
page, it will display immediately.</p>
<p>
For a manpage from a particular section, use either of the
following.  "cat(1)" is how cross-references appear and is
passed to man as "1 cat".</p>
<p>
    cat(1)
    1 cat</p>
<p>
To see manpages from all sections related to a subject, use an
"all pages" option (which might be "-a" if it's not the
default), then step through with `Man-next-manpage' (
Uses keymap `Man-mode-map', which is not currently defined.
M-x Man-next-manpage) etc.
Add to `Man-switches' to make this option permanent.</p>
<p>
    -a chmod</p>
<p>
An explicit filename can be given too.  Use -l if it might
otherwise look like a page name.</p>
<p>
    /my/file/name.1.gz
    -l somefile.1</p>
<p>
An "apropos" query with -k gives a buffer of matching page
names or descriptions.  The pattern argument is usually an
"egrep" style regexp.</p>
<p>
    -k pattern</p>
<p>
(fn MAN-ARGS)<a name="help-xref-button"></a>
<h3>Function: help-xref-button</h3>
Make a hyperlink for cross-reference text previously matched.
MATCH-NUMBER is the subexpression of interest in the last matched
regexp.  TYPE is the type of button to use.  Any remaining arguments are
passed to the button's help-function when it is invoked.
See `help-make-xrefs'.<a name="mode-line-next-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: mode-line-next-buffer</h3>
Like `next-buffer', but temporarily select EVENT's window.<a name="gnutls-boot"></a>
<h3>Function: gnutls-boot</h3>
Initialize GnuTLS client for process PROC with TYPE+PROPLIST.
Currently only client mode is supported.  Return a success/failure
value you can check with `gnutls-errorp'.</p>
<p>
TYPE is a symbol, either `gnutls-anon' or `gnutls-x509pki'.
PROPLIST is a property list with the following keys:</p>
<p>
:hostname is a string naming the remote host.</p>
<p>
:priority is a GnuTLS priority string, defaults to "NORMAL".</p>
<p>
:trustfiles is a list of PEM-encoded trust files for `gnutls-x509pki'.</p>
<p>
:crlfiles is a list of PEM-encoded CRL lists for `gnutls-x509pki'.</p>
<p>
:keylist is an alist of PEM-encoded key files and PEM-encoded
certificates for `gnutls-x509pki'.</p>
<p>
:callbacks is an alist of callback functions, see below.</p>
<p>
:loglevel is the debug level requested from GnuTLS, try 4.</p>
<p>
:verify-flags is a bitset as per GnuTLS'
gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags.</p>
<p>
:verify-hostname-error, if non-nil, makes a hostname mismatch an
error.  Otherwise it will be just a warning.</p>
<p>
:min-prime-bits is the minimum accepted number of bits the client will
accept in Diffie-Hellman key exchange.</p>
<p>
The debug level will be set for this process AND globally for GnuTLS.
So if you set it higher or lower at any point, it affects global
debugging.</p>
<p>
Note that the priority is set on the client.  The server does not use
the protocols's priority except for disabling protocols that were not
specified.</p>
<p>
Processes must be initialized with this function before other GnuTLS
functions are used.  This function allocates resources which can only
be deallocated by calling `gnutls-deinit' or by calling it again.</p>
<p>
The callbacks alist can have a `verify' key, associated with a
verification function (UNUSED).</p>
<p>
Each authentication type may need additional information in order to
work.  For X.509 PKI (`gnutls-x509pki'), you probably need at least
one trustfile (usually a CA bundle).</p>
<p>
(fn PROC TYPE PROPLIST)<a name="-only-some?"></a>
<h3>Function: -only-some?</h3>
Return `t` if at least one item of LIST matches PRED and at least one item of LIST does not match PRED.
Return `nil` both if all items match the predicate or if none of the items match the predicate.</p>
<p>
Alias: `-only-some-p'</p>
<p>
(fn PRED LIST)<a name="epl-package-from-file"></a>
<h3>Function: epl-package-from-file</h3>

Returns a list suitable for `perform-replace' if necessary,
the original string if not.<a name="completion--embedded-envvar-table"></a>
<h3>Function: completion--embedded-envvar-table</h3>
Completion table for envvars embedded in a string.
The envvar syntax (and escaping) rules followed by this table are the
same as `substitute-in-file-name'.</p>
<p>
(fn STRING PRED ACTION)<a name="dcl-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: dcl-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing DCL-files.</p>
<p>
This mode indents command lines in blocks.  (A block is commands between
THEN-ELSE-ENDIF and between lines matching dcl-block-begin-regexp and
dcl-block-end-regexp.)</p>
<p>
Labels are indented to a fixed position unless they begin or end a block.
Whole-line comments (matching dcl-comment-line-regexp) are not indented.
Data lines are not indented.</p>
<p>
Key bindings:</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `dcl-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
Commands not usually bound to keys:</p>
<p>
M-x dcl-save-nondefault-options		Save changed options
M-x dcl-save-all-options		Save all options
M-x dcl-save-option			Save any option
M-x dcl-save-mode			Save buffer mode</p>
<p>
Variables controlling indentation style and extra features:</p>
<p>
 dcl-basic-offset
    Extra indentation within blocks.</p>
<p>
 dcl-continuation-offset
    Extra indentation for continued lines.</p>
<p>
 dcl-margin-offset
    Indentation for the first command line in a file or SUBROUTINE.</p>
<p>
 dcl-margin-label-offset
    Indentation for a label.</p>
<p>
 dcl-comment-line-regexp
    Lines matching this regexp will not be indented.</p>
<p>
 dcl-block-begin-regexp
 dcl-block-end-regexp
    Regexps that match command lines that begin and end, respectively,
    a block of command lines that will be given extra indentation.
    Command lines between THEN-ELSE-ENDIF are always indented; these variables
    make it possible to define other places to indent.
    Set to nil to disable this feature.</p>
<p>
 dcl-calc-command-indent-function
    Can be set to a function that customizes indentation for command lines.
    Two such functions are included in the package:
	dcl-calc-command-indent-multiple
	dcl-calc-command-indent-hang</p>
<p>
 dcl-calc-cont-indent-function
    Can be set to a function that customizes indentation for continued lines.
    One such function is included in the package:
	dcl-calc-cont-indent-relative    (set by default)</p>
<p>
 dcl-tab-always-indent
    If t, pressing TAB always indents the current line.
    If nil, pressing TAB indents the current line if point is at the left
    margin.</p>
<p>
 dcl-electric-characters
    Non-nil causes lines to be indented at once when a label, ELSE or ENDIF is
    typed.</p>
<p>
 dcl-electric-reindent-regexps
    Use this variable and function dcl-electric-character to customize
    which words trigger electric indentation.</p>
<p>
 dcl-tempo-comma
 dcl-tempo-left-paren
 dcl-tempo-right-paren
    These variables control the look of expanded templates.</p>
<p>
 dcl-imenu-generic-expression
    Default value for imenu-generic-expression.  The default includes
    SUBROUTINE labels in the main listing and sub-listings for
    other labels, CALL, GOTO and GOSUB statements.</p>
<p>
 dcl-imenu-label-labels
 dcl-imenu-label-goto
 dcl-imenu-label-gosub
 dcl-imenu-label-call
    Change the text that is used as sub-listing labels in imenu.</p>
<p>
Loading this package calls the value of the variable
`dcl-mode-load-hook' with no args, if that value is non-nil.
Turning on DCL mode calls the value of the variable `dcl-mode-hook'
with no args, if that value is non-nil.</p>
<p>

The following example uses the default values for all variables:</p>
<p>
$! This is a comment line that is not indented (it matches
$! dcl-comment-line-regexp)
$! Next follows the first command line.  It is indented dcl-margin-offset.
$       i = 1
$       ! Other comments are indented like command lines.
$       ! A margin label indented dcl-margin-label-offset:
$ label:
$       if i.eq.1
$       then
$           ! Lines between THEN-ELSE and ELSE-ENDIF are
$           ! indented dcl-basic-offset
$           loop1: ! This matches dcl-block-begin-regexp...
$               ! ...so this line is indented dcl-basic-offset
$               text = "This " + - ! is a continued line
                       "lined up with the command line"
$               type sys$input
Data lines are not indented at all.
$           endloop1: ! This matches dcl-block-end-regexp
$       endif
$</p>
<p>

There is some minimal font-lock support (see vars
`dcl-font-lock-defaults' and `dcl-font-lock-keywords').</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="get-unused-category"></a>
<h3>Function: get-unused-category</h3>
Return a category which is not yet defined in TABLE.
If no category remains available, return nil.
The optional argument TABLE specifies which category table to modify;
it defaults to the current buffer's category table.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional TABLE)<a name="prin1-to-string"></a>
<h3>Function: prin1-to-string</h3>
Return a string containing the printed representation of OBJECT.
OBJECT can be any Lisp object.  This function outputs quoting characters
when necessary to make output that `read' can handle, whenever possible,
unless the optional second argument NOESCAPE is non-nil.  For complex objects,
the behavior is controlled by `print-level' and `print-length', which see.</p>
<p>
OBJECT is any of the Lisp data types: a number, a string, a symbol,
a list, a buffer, a window, a frame, etc.</p>
<p>
A printed representation of an object is text which describes that object.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT &optional NOESCAPE)<a name="-remove-item"></a>
<h3>Function: -remove-item</h3>
Remove all occurences of ITEM from LIST.</p>
<p>
Comparison is done with `equal'.</p>

and PSECS picoseconds.  SECS may be either an integer or a
floating point number.<a name="unjustify-current-line"></a>
<h3>Function: unjustify-current-line</h3>
Remove justification whitespace from current line.
If the line is centered or right-justified, this function removes any
indentation past the left margin.  If the line is full-justified, it removes
extra spaces between words.  It does nothing in other justification modes.<a name="todo-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: todo-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing TODO lists.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="apropos-variable"></a>
<h3>Function: apropos-variable</h3>
Show user variables that match PATTERN.
PATTERN can be a word, a list of words (separated by spaces),
or a regexp (using some regexp special characters).  If it is a word,
search for matches for that word as a substring.  If it is a list of words,
search for matches for any two (or more) of those words.</p>
<p>
With C-u prefix, or if `apropos-do-all' is non-nil, also show
normal variables.<a name="new-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: new-frame</h3>
Return a newly created frame displaying the current buffer.
Optional argument PARAMETERS is an alist of frame parameters for
the new frame.  Each element of PARAMETERS should have the
form (NAME . VALUE), for example:</p>
<p>
 (name . STRING)	The frame should be named STRING.</p>
<p>
 (width . NUMBER)	The frame should be NUMBER characters in width.
 (height . NUMBER)	The frame should be NUMBER text lines high.</p>
<p>
You cannot specify either `width' or `height', you must specify
neither or both.</p>
<p>
 (minibuffer . t)	The frame should have a minibuffer.
 (minibuffer . nil)	The frame should have no minibuffer.
 (minibuffer . only)	The frame should contain only a minibuffer.
 (minibuffer . WINDOW)	The frame should use WINDOW as its minibuffer window.</p>
<p>
 (window-system . nil)	The frame should be displayed on a terminal device.
 (window-system . x)	The frame should be displayed in an X window.</p>
<p>
 (display . ":0")     The frame should appear on display :0.</p>
<p>
 (terminal . TERMINAL)  The frame should use the terminal object TERMINAL.</p>
<p>
In addition, any parameter specified in `default-frame-alist',
but not present in PARAMETERS, is applied.</p>
<p>
Before creating the frame (via `frame-creation-function-alist'),
this function runs the hook `before-make-frame-hook'.  After
creating the frame, it runs the hook `after-make-frame-functions'
with one arg, the newly created frame.</p>
<p>
If a display parameter is supplied and a window-system is not,
guess the window-system from the display.</p>
<p>
On graphical displays, this function does not itself make the new
frame the selected frame.  However, the window system may select
the new frame according to its own rules.<a name="window-full-height-p"></a>
<h3>Function: window-full-height-p</h3>
Return t if WINDOW is as high as its containing frame.
More precisely, return t if and only if the total height of
WINDOW equals the total height of the root window of WINDOW's
frame.  WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the
selected one.<a name="process-lines"></a>
<h3>Function: process-lines</h3>
Execute PROGRAM with ARGS, returning its output as a list of lines.
Signal an error if the program returns with a non-zero exit status.<a name="marker-insertion-type"></a>
<h3>Function: marker-insertion-type</h3>
Return insertion type of MARKER: t if it stays after inserted text.
The value nil means the marker stays before text inserted there.</p>
<p>
(fn MARKER)<a name="read-coding-system"></a>
<h3>Function: read-coding-system</h3>
Read a coding system from the minibuffer, prompting with string PROMPT.
If the user enters null input, return second argument DEFAULT-CODING-SYSTEM.

are lower-case).</p>
<p>
(fn PROMPT &optional DEFAULT-CODING-SYSTEM)<a name="gcd"></a>
<h3>Function: gcd</h3>
Return the greatest common divisor of the arguments.</p>
<p>
(fn &rest ARGS)<a name="goto-history-element"></a>

<p>
(fn)<a name="propertized-buffer-identification"></a>
<h3>Function: propertized-buffer-identification</h3>
Return a list suitable for `mode-line-buffer-identification'.
FMT is a format specifier such as "%12b".  This function adds
text properties for face, help-echo, and local-map to it.<a name="ispell-get-aspell-config-value"></a>
<h3>Function: ispell-get-aspell-config-value</h3>
Return value of Aspell configuration option KEY.
Assumes that value contains no whitespace.<a name="global-flycheck-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: global-flycheck-mode</h3>
Toggle Flycheck mode in all buffers.
With prefix ARG, enable Global-Flycheck mode if ARG is positive;
otherwise, disable it.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode if
ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Flycheck mode is enabled in all buffers where
`flycheck-mode-on-safe' would do it.
See `flycheck-mode' for more information on Flycheck mode.<a name="json-read-string"></a>
<h3>Function: json-read-string</h3>
Read the JSON string at point.<a name="ert--results-format-expected-unexpected"></a>
<h3>Function: ert--results-format-expected-unexpected</h3>
Return a string indicating EXPECTED expected results, UNEXPECTED unexpected.<a name="ietf-drums-parse-date"></a>
<h3>Function: ietf-drums-parse-date</h3>
Return an Emacs time spec from STRING.<a name="define-mail-user-agent"></a>
<h3>Function: define-mail-user-agent</h3>
Define a symbol to identify a mail-sending package for `mail-user-agent'.</p>
<p>
SYMBOL can be any Lisp symbol.  Its function definition and/or
value as a variable do not matter for this usage; we use only certain
properties on its property list, to encode the rest of the arguments.</p>
<p>
COMPOSEFUNC is program callable function that composes an outgoing
mail message buffer.  This function should set up the basics of the
buffer without requiring user interaction.  It should populate the
standard mail headers, leaving the `to:' and `subject:' headers blank
by default.</p>
<p>
COMPOSEFUNC should accept several optional arguments--the same
arguments that `compose-mail' takes.  See that function's documentation.</p>
<p>
SENDFUNC is the command a user would run to send the message.</p>
<p>
Optional ABORTFUNC is the command a user would run to abort the
message.  For mail packages that don't have a separate abort function,
this can be `kill-buffer' (the equivalent of omitting this argument).</p>
<p>
Optional HOOKVAR is a hook variable that gets run before the message
is actually sent.  Callers that use the `mail-user-agent' may
install a hook function temporarily on this hook variable.
If HOOKVAR is nil, `mail-send-hook' is used.</p>
<p>
The properties used on SYMBOL are `composefunc', `sendfunc',
`abortfunc', and `hookvar'.<a name="split-string-and-unquote"></a>
<h3>Function: split-string-and-unquote</h3>
Split the STRING into a list of strings.
It understands Emacs Lisp quoting within STRING, such that
  (split-string-and-unquote (combine-and-quote-strings strs)) == strs
The SEPARATOR regexp defaults to "\s-+".<a name="file-modes"></a>
<h3>Function: file-modes</h3>

String to usefully prompt for a username.<a name="lm-header"></a>
<h3>Function: lm-header</h3>
Return the contents of the header named HEADER.<a name="dump-emacs"></a>
<h3>Function: dump-emacs</h3>
Dump current state of Emacs into executable file FILENAME.
Take symbols from SYMFILE (presumably the file you executed to run Emacs).
This is used in the file `loadup.el' when building Emacs.</p>
<p>

(fn RESOURCE CLASS FRAME)<a name="rfc2231-parse-string"></a>
<h3>Function: rfc2231-parse-string</h3>
Parse STRING and return a list.
The list will be on the form
 `(name (attribute . value) (attribute . value)...)'.</p>
<p>
If the optional SIGNAL-ERROR is non-nil, signal an error when this
function fails in parsing of parameters.  Otherwise, this function
must never cause a Lisp error.<a name="url-cache-create-filename-using-md5"></a>
<h3>Function: url-cache-create-filename-using-md5</h3>
Create a cached filename using MD5.
Very fast if you have an `md5' primitive function, suitably fast otherwise.<a name="word-search-forward"></a>
<h3>Function: word-search-forward</h3>
Search forward from point for STRING, ignoring differences in punctuation.
Set point to the end of the occurrence found, and return point.
An optional second argument bounds the search; it is a buffer position.
The match found must not extend after that position.
Optional third argument, if t, means if fail just return nil (no error).
  If not nil and not t, move to limit of search and return nil.
Optional fourth argument is repeat count--search for successive occurrences.</p>
<p>
Relies on the function `word-search-regexp' to convert a sequence
of words in STRING to a regexp used to search words without regard
to punctuation.<a name="read-multilingual-string"></a>
<h3>Function: read-multilingual-string</h3>
Read a multilingual string from minibuffer, prompting with string PROMPT.
The input method selected last time is activated in minibuffer.
If optional second argument INITIAL-INPUT is non-nil, insert it in the
minibuffer initially.
Optional 3rd argument INPUT-METHOD specifies the input method to be activated
instead of the one selected last time.  It is a symbol or a string.<a name="clone-indirect-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: clone-indirect-buffer</h3>
Create an indirect buffer that is a twin copy of the current buffer.</p>
<p>
Give the indirect buffer name NEWNAME.  Interactively, read NEWNAME
from the minibuffer when invoked with a prefix arg.  If NEWNAME is nil
or if not called with a prefix arg, NEWNAME defaults to the current
buffer's name.  The name is modified by adding a `<N>' suffix to it
or by incrementing the N in an existing suffix.  Trying to clone a
buffer whose major mode symbol has a non-nil `no-clone-indirect'
property results in an error.</p>
<p>
DISPLAY-FLAG non-nil means show the new buffer with `pop-to-buffer'.
This is always done when called interactively.</p>
<p>
Optional third arg NORECORD non-nil means do not put this buffer at the
front of the list of recently selected ones.<a name="recover-session-finish"></a>
<h3>Function: recover-session-finish</h3>
Choose one saved session to recover auto-save files from.
This command is used in the special Dired buffer created by
M-x recover-session.<a name="split-window"></a>
<h3>Function: split-window</h3>
Make a new window adjacent to WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.
Return the new window which is always a live window.</p>
<p>
Optional argument SIZE a positive number means make WINDOW SIZE
lines or columns tall.  If SIZE is negative, make the new window
-SIZE lines or columns tall.  If and only if SIZE is non-nil, its
absolute value can be less than `window-min-height' or
`window-min-width'; so this command can make a new window as
small as one line or two columns.  SIZE defaults to half of
WINDOW's size.  Interactively, SIZE is the prefix argument.</p>
<p>
Optional third argument SIDE nil (or `below') specifies that the
new window shall be located below WINDOW.  SIDE `above' means the
new window shall be located above WINDOW.  In both cases SIZE
specifies the new number of lines for WINDOW (or the new window
if SIZE is negative) including space reserved for the mode and/or
header line.</p>
<p>
SIDE t (or `right') specifies that the new window shall be
located on the right side of WINDOW.  SIDE `left' means the new
window shall be located on the left of WINDOW.  In both cases
SIZE specifies the new number of columns for WINDOW (or the new
window provided SIZE is negative) including space reserved for
fringes and the scrollbar or a divider column.  Any other non-nil
value for SIDE is currently handled like t (or `right').</p>
<p>
If the variable `ignore-window-parameters' is non-nil or the
`split-window' parameter of WINDOW equals t, do not process any
parameters of WINDOW.  Otherwise, if the `split-window' parameter
of WINDOW specifies a function, call that function with all three
arguments and return the value returned by that function.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, if WINDOW is part of an atomic window, "split" the
root of that atomic window.  The new window does not become a
member of that atomic window.</p>
<p>
If WINDOW is live, properties of the new window like margins and
scrollbars are inherited from WINDOW.  If WINDOW is an internal
window, these properties as well as the buffer displayed in the
new window are inherited from the window selected on WINDOW's
frame.  The selected window is not changed by this function.<a name="keywordp"></a>

<p>
(fn &rest VARIANTS)<a name="kmacro-call-macro"></a>
<h3>Function: kmacro-call-macro</h3>
Call the last keyboard macro that you defined with C-x (.
A prefix argument serves as a repeat count.  Zero means repeat until error.</p>
<p>
When you call the macro, you can call the macro again by repeating
just the last key in the key sequence that you used to call this
command.  See `kmacro-call-repeat-key' and `kmacro-call-repeat-with-arg'

<a name="md5"></a>
<h3>Function: md5</h3>
Return MD5 message digest of OBJECT, a buffer or string.</p>
<p>
A message digest is a cryptographic checksum of a document, and the
algorithm to calculate it is defined in RFC 1321.</p>
<p>
The two optional arguments START and END are character positions
specifying for which part of OBJECT the message digest should be
computed.  If nil or omitted, the digest is computed for the whole
OBJECT.</p>
<p>
The MD5 message digest is computed from the result of encoding the
text in a coding system, not directly from the internal Emacs form of
the text.  The optional fourth argument CODING-SYSTEM specifies which
coding system to encode the text with.  It should be the same coding
system that you used or will use when actually writing the text into a
file.</p>
<p>
If CODING-SYSTEM is nil or omitted, the default depends on OBJECT.  If
OBJECT is a buffer, the default for CODING-SYSTEM is whatever coding
system would be chosen by default for writing this text into a file.</p>
<p>
If OBJECT is a string, the most preferred coding system (see the
command `prefer-coding-system') is used.</p>
<p>
If NOERROR is non-nil, silently assume the `raw-text' coding if the
guesswork fails.  Normally, an error is signaled in such case.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT &optional START END CODING-SYSTEM NOERROR)<a name="json-encode-key"></a>

FROM can be a string, as in `write-region'.
CODINGS is the list of base coding systems known to be safe for this region,
  typically obtained with `find-coding-systems-region'.
UNSAFE is a list of coding systems known to be unsafe for this region.
REJECTED is a list of coding systems which were safe but for some reason
  were not recommended in the particular context.
DEFAULT is the coding system to use by default in the query.<a name="custom-add-frequent-value"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-add-frequent-value</h3>
To the variable SYMBOL add OPTION.</p>
<p>
If SYMBOL's custom type is a hook, OPTION should be a hook member.
If SYMBOL's custom type is an alist, OPTION specifies a symbol
to offer to the user as a possible key in the alist.
For other custom types, this has no effect.<a name="package-download-transaction"></a>
<h3>Function: package-download-transaction</h3>
Download and install all the packages in PACKAGE-LIST.
PACKAGE-LIST should be a list of package names (symbols).
This function assumes that all package requirements in
PACKAGE-LIST are satisfied, i.e. that PACKAGE-LIST is computed
using `package-compute-transaction'.<a name="facemenu-color-equal"></a>
<h3>Function: facemenu-color-equal</h3>
Return t if colors A and B are the same color.
A and B should be strings naming colors.
This function queries the display system to find out what the color
names mean.  It returns nil if the colors differ or if it can't
determine the correct answer.<a name="narrow-to-page"></a>
<h3>Function: narrow-to-page</h3>

If SYMBOL does not name a valid Lisp face or KEYWORD isn't a valid
face attribute name, signal an error.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face SYMBOL in that
frame.  If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face SYMBOL (for new
frames).  If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.</p>
<p>
(fn SYMBOL KEYWORD &optional FRAME)<a name="ispell-mime-skip-part"></a>
<h3>Function: ispell-mime-skip-part</h3>
Move point across header, or entire MIME part if message is encoded.
All specified types except `7bit' `8bit' and `quoted-printable' are considered
encoded and therefore skipped.  See rfc 1521, 2183, ...
If no boundary is given, then entire message is skipped.</p>
<p>
This starts one line ABOVE the MIME content messages, on the boundary marker,
for operation with the generic region-skipping code.
This places new MIME boundaries into variable `ispell-checking-message'.<a name="tibetan-compose-region"></a>

The second optional arg ENVIRONMENT specifies an environment of macro
definitions to shadow the loaded ones for use in file byte-compilation.</p>
<p>
(fn FORM &optional ENVIRONMENT)<a name="append-to-file"></a>
<h3>Function: append-to-file</h3>
Append the contents of the region to the end of file FILENAME.
When called from a function, expects three arguments,
START, END and FILENAME.  START and END are normally buffer positions
specifying the part of the buffer to write.
If START is nil, that means to use the entire buffer contents.
If START is a string, then output that string to the file
instead of any buffer contents; END is ignored.</p>
<p>
This does character code conversion and applies annotations
like `write-region' does.<a name="kill-paragraph"></a>

<h3>Function: table-justify</h3>
Justify contents of a cell, a row of cells or a column of cells.
WHAT is a symbol 'cell, 'row or 'column.  JUSTIFY is a symbol 'left,
'center, 'right, 'top, 'middle, 'bottom or 'none.</p>
<p>
(fn WHAT JUSTIFY)<a name="sh-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: sh-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing shell scripts.
This mode works for many shells, since they all have roughly the same syntax,
as far as commands, arguments, variables, pipes, comments etc. are concerned.
Unless the file's magic number indicates the shell, your usual shell is
assumed.  Since filenames rarely give a clue, they are not further analyzed.</p>
<p>
This mode adapts to the variations between shells (see `sh-set-shell') by
means of an inheritance based feature lookup (see `sh-feature').  This
mechanism applies to all variables (including skeletons) that pertain to
shell-specific features.</p>
<p>
The default style of this mode is that of Rosenblatt's Korn shell book.
The syntax of the statements varies with the shell being used.  The
following commands are available, based on the current shell's syntax:</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `sh-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
M-x sh-case	 case statement
M-x sh-for	 for loop
M-x sh-function	 function definition
M-x sh-if	 if statement
M-x sh-indexed-loop	 indexed loop from 1 to n
M-x sh-while-getopts	 while getopts loop
M-x sh-repeat	 repeat loop
M-x sh-select	 select loop
M-x sh-until	 until loop
M-x sh-while	 while loop</p>
<p>
For sh and rc shells indentation commands are:
M-x sh-show-indent	Show the variable controlling this line's indentation.
M-x sh-set-indent	Set then variable controlling this line's indentation.
M-x sh-learn-line-indent	Change the indentation variable so this line
would indent to the way it currently is.
M-x sh-learn-buffer-indent  Set the indentation variables so the
buffer indents as it currently is indented.</p>
<p>

M-x backward-delete-char-untabify	 Delete backward one position, even if it was a tab.
C-j	 Delete unquoted space and indent new line same as this one.
M-x sh-end-of-command	 Go to end of successive commands.
M-x sh-beginning-of-command	 Go to beginning of successive commands.
M-x sh-set-shell	 Set this buffer's shell, and maybe its magic number.
M-x sh-execute-region	 Have optional header and region be executed in a subshell.</p>
<p>
`sh-electric-here-document-mode' controls whether insertion of two
unquoted < insert a here document.</p>
<p>
If you generally program a shell different from your login shell you can
set `sh-shell-file' accordingly.  If your shell's file name doesn't correctly
indicate what shell it is use `sh-alias-alist' to translate.</p>
<p>
If your shell gives error messages with line numbers, you can use M-x executable-interpret
with your script for an edit-interpret-debug cycle.</p>

(fn)<a name="yank-handle-category-property"></a>
<h3>Function: yank-handle-category-property</h3>
Apply property category CATEGORY's properties between START and END.<a name="recenter"></a>
<h3>Function: recenter</h3>
Center point in selected window and maybe redisplay frame.
With prefix argument ARG, recenter putting point on screen line ARG
relative to the selected window.  If ARG is negative, it counts up from the
bottom of the window.  (ARG should be less than the height of the window.)</p>
<p>
If ARG is omitted or nil, then recenter with point on the middle line of
the selected window; if the variable `recenter-redisplay' is non-nil,
also erase the entire frame and redraw it (when `auto-resize-tool-bars'
is set to `grow-only', this resets the tool-bar's height to the minimum
height needed); if `recenter-redisplay' has the special value `tty',
then only tty frames are redrawn.</p>
<p>
Just C-u as prefix means put point in the center of the window
and redisplay normally--don't erase and redraw the frame.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="kill-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: kill-buffer</h3>
Kill the buffer specified by BUFFER-OR-NAME.
The argument may be a buffer or the name of an existing buffer.
Argument nil or omitted means kill the current buffer.  Return t if the
buffer is actually killed, nil otherwise.</p>
<p>
The functions in `kill-buffer-query-functions' are called with the
buffer to be killed as the current buffer.  If any of them returns nil,
the buffer is not killed.  The hook `kill-buffer-hook' is run before the
buffer is actually killed.  The buffer being killed will be current
while the hook is running.  Functions called by any of these hooks are
supposed to not change the current buffer.</p>
<p>
Any processes that have this buffer as the `process-buffer' are killed
with SIGHUP.  This function calls `replace-buffer-in-windows' for
cleaning up all windows currently displaying the buffer to be killed.</p>

<h3>Function: mm-insert-file-contents</h3>
Like `insert-file-contents', but only reads in the file.
A buffer may be modified in several ways after reading into the buffer due
to advanced Emacs features, such as file-name-handlers, format decoding,
`find-file-hooks', etc.
If INHIBIT is non-nil, inhibit `mm-inhibit-file-name-handlers'.
  This function ensures that none of these modifications will take place.<a name="subsetp"></a>
<h3>Function: subsetp</h3>

possibly preceded by keyword pairs as described in `easy-menu-define'.<a name="time-stamp"></a>
<h3>Function: time-stamp</h3>
Update the time stamp string(s) in the buffer.
A template in a file can be automatically updated with a new time stamp
every time you save the file.  Add this line to your init file:
    (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'time-stamp)
or customize `before-save-hook' through Custom.
Normally the template must appear in the first 8 lines of a file and
look like one of the following:
      Time-stamp: <>
      Time-stamp: " "
The time stamp is written between the brackets or quotes:
      Time-stamp: <2001-02-18 10:20:51 gildea>
The time stamp is updated only if the variable `time-stamp-active' is non-nil.
The format of the time stamp is set by the variable `time-stamp-pattern' or
`time-stamp-format'.  The variables `time-stamp-pattern',
`time-stamp-line-limit', `time-stamp-start', `time-stamp-end',
`time-stamp-count', and `time-stamp-inserts-lines' control finding
the template.</p>

Merge files in directories DIR1 and DIR2 using files in ANCESTOR-DIR as ancestors.
Ediff merges files that have identical names in DIR1, DIR2.  If a pair of files
in DIR1 and DIR2 doesn't have an ancestor in ANCESTOR-DIR, Ediff will merge
without ancestor.  The fourth argument, REGEXP, is nil or a regular expression;
only file names that match the regexp are considered.</p>
<p>
(fn DIR1 DIR2 ANCESTOR-DIR REGEXP &optional MERGE-AUTOSTORE-DIR)<a name="move-to-window-line"></a>
<h3>Function: move-to-window-line</h3>

<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="set-window-hscroll"></a>
<h3>Function: set-window-hscroll</h3>
Set number of columns WINDOW is scrolled from left margin to NCOL.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.
Clip the number to a reasonable value if out of range.
Return the new number.  NCOL should be zero or positive.</p>
<p>
Note that if `automatic-hscrolling' is non-nil, you cannot scroll the
window so that the location of point moves off-window.</p>
<p>
(fn WINDOW NCOL)<a name="next-overlay-change"></a>
<h3>Function: next-overlay-change</h3>
Return the next position after POS where an overlay starts or ends.
If there are no overlay boundaries from POS to (point-max),
the value is (point-max).</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: kill-sexp</h3>
Kill the sexp (balanced expression) following point.
With ARG, kill that many sexps after point.
Negative arg -N means kill N sexps before point.
This command assumes point is not in a string or comment.<a name="line-end-position"></a>
<h3>Function: line-end-position</h3>
Return the character position of the last character on the current line.
With argument N not nil or 1, move forward N - 1 lines first.
If scan reaches end of buffer, return that position.</p>
<p>
This function ignores text display directionality; it returns the
position of the last character in logical order, i.e. the largest
character position on the line.</p>
<p>
This function constrains the returned position to the current field
unless that would be on a different line than the original,
unconstrained result.  If N is nil or 1, and a rear-sticky field ends
at point, the scan stops as soon as it starts.  To ignore field
boundaries bind `inhibit-field-text-motion' to t.</p>
<p>
This function does not move point.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: shell-filter-ctrl-a-ctrl-b</h3>
Remove `^A' and `^B' characters from comint output.</p>
<p>
Bash uses these characters as internal quoting characters in its
prompt.  Due to a bug in some bash versions (including 2.03,
2.04, and 2.05b), they may erroneously show up when bash is
started with the `--noediting' option and Select Graphic
Rendition (SGR) control sequences (formerly known as ANSI escape
sequences) are used to color the prompt.</p>

<p>
Note that version string "1" is equal to "1.0", "1.0.0", "1.0.0.0",
etc.  That is, the trailing ".0"s are insignificant.  Also, version
string "1" is higher (newer) than "1pre", which is higher than "1beta",
which is higher than "1alpha".  Also, "-CVS" and "-NNN" are treated
as alpha versions.<a name="1+"></a>
<h3>Function: 1+</h3>
Return NUMBER plus one.  NUMBER may be a number or a marker.
Markers are converted to integers.</p>
<p>

<p>
(fn &optional REGEXP)<a name="register-to-point"></a>
<h3>Function: register-to-point</h3>
Move point to location stored in a register.
If the register contains a file name, find that file.
(To put a file name in a register, you must use `set-register'.)
If the register contains a window configuration (one frame) or a frame
configuration (all frames), restore that frame or all frames accordingly.
First argument is a character, naming the register.
Optional second arg non-nil (interactively, prefix argument) says to
delete any existing frames that the frame configuration doesn't mention.
(Otherwise, these frames are iconified.)<a name="set-justification-none"></a>

<p>
(fn)<a name="checkdoc-eval-current-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: checkdoc-eval-current-buffer</h3>
Evaluate and check documentation for the current buffer.
Evaluation is done first because good documentation for something that
doesn't work is just not useful.  Comments, doc strings, and rogue
spacing are all verified.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="current-indentation"></a>
<h3>Function: current-indentation</h3>
Return the indentation of the current line.
This is the horizontal position of the character
following any initial whitespace.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="user-login-name"></a>
<h3>Function: user-login-name</h3>
Return the name under which the user logged in, as a string.
This is based on the effective uid, not the real uid.
Also, if the environment variables LOGNAME or USER are set,
that determines the value of this function.</p>
<p>
If optional argument UID is an integer or a float, return the login name
of the user with that uid, or nil if there is no such user.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional UID)<a name="garbage-collect"></a>
<h3>Function: garbage-collect</h3>
Reclaim storage for Lisp objects no longer needed.
Garbage collection happens automatically if you cons more than
`gc-cons-threshold' bytes of Lisp data since previous garbage collection.
`garbage-collect' normally returns a list with info on amount of space in use,
where each entry has the form (NAME SIZE USED FREE), where:
- NAME is a symbol describing the kind of objects this entry represents,
- SIZE is the number of bytes used by each one,
- USED is the number of those objects that were found live in the heap,
- FREE is the number of those objects that are not live but that Emacs
  keeps around for future allocations (maybe because it does not know how
  to return them to the OS).
However, if there was overflow in pure space, `garbage-collect'
returns nil, because real GC can't be done.
See Info node `(elisp)Garbage Collection'.</p>

<h3>Function: ediff-regions-linewise</h3>
Run Ediff on a pair of regions in specified buffers.
Regions (i.e., point and mark) can be set in advance or marked interactively.
Each region is enlarged to contain full lines.
This function is effective for large regions, over 100-200
lines.  For small regions, use `ediff-regions-wordwise'.</p>
<p>
(fn BUFFER-A BUFFER-B &optional STARTUP-HOOKS)<a name="abbrev-prefix-mark"></a>
<h3>Function: abbrev-prefix-mark</h3>
Mark current point as the beginning of an abbrev.
Abbrev to be expanded starts here rather than at beginning of word.
This way, you can expand an abbrev with a prefix: insert the prefix,
use this command, then insert the abbrev.  This command inserts a
temporary hyphen after the prefix (until the intended abbrev
expansion occurs).
If the prefix is itself an abbrev, this command expands it, unless
ARG is non-nil.  Interactively, ARG is the prefix argument.</p>

S is the body.  Returns a cons cell whose cdr is piece of code which
is the macro-expansion of S, and whose car is a small integer whose value
can either indicate that the code is constant (0), or not (1), or returns
a list which should be spliced into its environment (2).
LEVEL is only used internally and indicates the nesting level:
0 (the default) is for the toplevel nested inside a single backquote.<a name="variable-binding-locus"></a>
<h3>Function: variable-binding-locus</h3>
Return a value indicating where VARIABLE's current binding comes from.
If the current binding is buffer-local, the value is the current buffer.
If the current binding is frame-local, the value is the selected frame.
If the current binding is global (the default), the value is nil.</p>
<p>
(fn VARIABLE)<a name="ert--stats-set-test-and-result"></a>
<h3>Function: ert--stats-set-test-and-result</h3>
Change STATS by replacing the test at position POS with TEST and RESULT.</p>
<p>
Also changes the counters in STATS to match.<a name="eieiomt-add"></a>
<h3>Function: eieiomt-add</h3>
Add to METHOD-NAME the forms METHOD in a call position KEY for CLASS.
METHOD-NAME is the name created by a call to `defgeneric'.
METHOD are the forms for a given implementation.
KEY is an integer (see comment in eieio.el near this function) which
is associated with the :static :before :primary and :after tags.
It also indicates if CLASS is defined or not.
CLASS is the class this method is associated with.<a name="fill-context-prefix"></a>
<h3>Function: fill-context-prefix</h3>
Compute a fill prefix from the text between FROM and TO.
This uses the variables `adaptive-fill-regexp' and `adaptive-fill-function'
and `adaptive-fill-first-line-regexp'.  `paragraph-start' also plays a role;
we reject a prefix based on a one-line paragraph if that prefix would
act as a paragraph-separator.<a name="multi-isearch-buffers"></a>
<h3>Function: multi-isearch-buffers</h3>
Start multi-buffer Isearch on a list of BUFFERS.
This list can contain live buffers or their names.
Interactively read buffer names to search, one by one, ended with RET.
With a prefix argument, ask for a regexp, and search in buffers
whose names match the specified regexp.<a name="dired-noselect"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-noselect</h3>
Like `dired' but returns the dired buffer as value, does not select it.</p>
<p>
(fn DIR-OR-LIST &optional SWITCHES)<a name="define-category"></a>
<h3>Function: define-category</h3>
Define CATEGORY as a category which is described by DOCSTRING.
CATEGORY should be an ASCII printing character in the range ` ' to `~'.
DOCSTRING is the documentation string of the category.  The first line
should be a terse text (preferably less than 16 characters),
and the rest lines should be the full description.
The category is defined only in category table TABLE, which defaults to
the current buffer's category table.</p>
<p>
(fn CATEGORY DOCSTRING &optional TABLE)<a name="flycheck-verification-result-new"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-verification-result-new</h3></p>
<p>

(fn &key LABEL MESSAGE FACE)<a name="server-done"></a>
<h3>Function: server-done</h3>
Offer to save current buffer, mark it as "done" for clients.
This kills or buries the buffer, then returns a list
of the form (NEXT-BUFFER KILLED).  NEXT-BUFFER is another server buffer,
as a suggestion for what to select next, or nil.
KILLED is t if we killed BUFFER, which happens if it was created
specifically for the clients and did not exist before their request for it.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="completion--insert-strings"></a>
<h3>Function: completion--insert-strings</h3>
Insert a list of STRINGS into the current buffer.
Uses columns to keep the listing readable but compact.
It also eliminates runs of equal strings.</p>
<p>
(fn STRINGS)<a name="recover-session"></a>
<h3>Function: recover-session</h3>
Recover auto save files from a previous Emacs session.
This command first displays a Dired buffer showing you the
previous sessions that you could recover from.
To choose one, move point to the proper line and then type C-c C-c.
Then you'll be asked about a number of files to recover.<a name="window-pixel-edges"></a>
<h3>Function: window-pixel-edges</h3>
Return a list of the edge pixel coordinates of WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
The returned list has the form (LEFT TOP RIGHT BOTTOM), all relative to
0, 0 at the top left corner of the frame.</p>
<p>
RIGHT is one more than the rightmost x position occupied by WINDOW.
BOTTOM is one more than the bottommost y position occupied by WINDOW.
The pixel edges include the space used by WINDOW's scroll bar, display
margins, fringes, header line, and/or mode line.  For the pixel edges
of just the text area, use `window-inside-pixel-edges'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WINDOW)<a name="flycheck-rx-id"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-rx-id</h3>
Translate the `(id)' FORM into a regular expression.<a name="find-file-noselect"></a>
<h3>Function: find-file-noselect</h3>
Read file FILENAME into a buffer and return the buffer.
If a buffer exists visiting FILENAME, return that one, but
verify that the file has not changed since visited or saved.
The buffer is not selected, just returned to the caller.
Optional second arg NOWARN non-nil means suppress any warning messages.
Optional third arg RAWFILE non-nil means the file is read literally.
Optional fourth arg WILDCARDS non-nil means do wildcard processing
and visit all the matching files.  When wildcards are actually
used and expanded, return a list of buffers that are visiting
the various files.<a name="backward-sentence"></a>
<h3>Function: backward-sentence</h3>
Move backward to start of sentence.  With arg, do it arg times.
See `forward-sentence' for more information.<a name="quoted-insert"></a>
<h3>Function: quoted-insert</h3>
Read next input character and insert it.
This is useful for inserting control characters.
With argument, insert ARG copies of the character.</p>
<p>
If the first character you type after this command is an octal digit,
you should type a sequence of octal digits which specify a character code.
Any nondigit terminates the sequence.  If the terminator is a RET,
it is discarded; any other terminator is used itself as input.
The variable `read-quoted-char-radix' specifies the radix for this feature;
set it to 10 or 16 to use decimal or hex instead of octal.</p>
<p>
In overwrite mode, this function inserts the character anyway, and
does not handle octal digits specially.  This means that if you use
overwrite as your normal editing mode, you can use this function to
insert characters when necessary.</p>
<p>
In binary overwrite mode, this function does overwrite, and octal
digits are interpreted as a character code.  This is intended to be
useful for editing binary files.<a name="add-to-ordered-list"></a>
<h3>Function: add-to-ordered-list</h3>
Add ELEMENT to the value of LIST-VAR if it isn't there yet.
The test for presence of ELEMENT is done with `eq'.</p>
<p>
The resulting list is reordered so that the elements are in the
order given by each element's numeric list order.  Elements
without a numeric list order are placed at the end of the list.</p>
<p>
If the third optional argument ORDER is a number (integer or
float), set the element's list order to the given value.  If
ORDER is nil or omitted, do not change the numeric order of
ELEMENT.  If ORDER has any other value, remove the numeric order
of ELEMENT if it has one.</p>
<p>
The list order for each element is stored in LIST-VAR's
`list-order' property.</p>
<p>
The return value is the new value of LIST-VAR.<a name="widget-specify-sample"></a>
<h3>Function: widget-specify-sample</h3>
Specify sample for WIDGET between FROM and TO.</p>
<p>
(fn WIDGET FROM TO)<a name="flycheck-validate-next-checker"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-validate-next-checker</h3>

(fn)<a name="conf-space-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: conf-space-mode</h3>
Conf Mode starter for space separated conf files.
"Assignments" are with ` '.  Keywords before the parameters are
recognized according to the variable `conf-space-keywords-alist'.
Alternatively, you can specify a value for the file local variable
`conf-space-keywords'.
Use the function `conf-space-keywords' if you want to specify keywords
in an interactive fashion instead.</p>
<p>
For details see `conf-mode'.  Example:</p>
<p>
# Conf mode font-locks this right with M-x conf-space-mode (space separated)</p>

(fn)<a name="dns-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: dns-mode</h3>
Major mode for viewing and editing DNS master files.
This mode is inherited from text mode.  It add syntax
highlighting, and some commands for handling DNS master files.
Its keymap inherits from `text-mode' and it has the same
variables for customizing indentation.  It has its own abbrev
table and its own syntax table.</p>
<p>
Turning on DNS mode runs `dns-mode-hook'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="make-serial-process"></a>
<h3>Function: make-serial-process</h3>
Create and return a serial port process.</p>
<p>
In Emacs, serial port connections are represented by process objects,
so input and output work as for subprocesses, and `delete-process'
closes a serial port connection.  However, a serial process has no
process id, it cannot be signaled, and the status codes are different
from normal processes.</p>
<p>
`make-serial-process' creates a process and a buffer, on which you
probably want to use `process-send-string'.  Try M-x serial-term for
an interactive terminal.  See below for examples.</p>
<p>
Arguments are specified as keyword/argument pairs.  The following
arguments are defined:</p>
<p>
:port PORT -- (mandatory) PORT is the path or name of the serial port.
For example, this could be "/dev/ttyS0" on Unix.  On Windows, this
could be "COM1", or "\\.\COM10" for ports higher than COM9 (double
the backslashes in strings).</p>
<p>
:speed SPEED -- (mandatory) is handled by `serial-process-configure',
which this function calls.</p>
<p>
:name NAME -- NAME is the name of the process.  If NAME is not given,
the value of PORT is used.</p>
<p>
:buffer BUFFER -- BUFFER is the buffer (or buffer-name) to associate
with the process.  Process output goes at the end of that buffer,
unless you specify an output stream or filter function to handle the
output.  If BUFFER is not given, the value of NAME is used.</p>
<p>
:coding CODING -- If CODING is a symbol, it specifies the coding
system used for both reading and writing for this process.  If CODING
is a cons (DECODING . ENCODING), DECODING is used for reading, and
ENCODING is used for writing.</p>
<p>
:noquery BOOL -- When exiting Emacs, query the user if BOOL is nil and
the process is running.  If BOOL is not given, query before exiting.</p>
<p>
:stop BOOL -- Start process in the `stopped' state if BOOL is non-nil.
In the stopped state, a serial process does not accept incoming data,
but you can send outgoing data.  The stopped state is cleared by
`continue-process' and set by `stop-process'.</p>
<p>
:filter FILTER -- Install FILTER as the process filter.</p>
<p>
:sentinel SENTINEL -- Install SENTINEL as the process sentinel.</p>
<p>
:plist PLIST -- Install PLIST as the initial plist of the process.</p>
<p>
:bytesize
:parity
:stopbits
:flowcontrol
-- This function calls `serial-process-configure' to handle these
arguments.</p>
<p>
The original argument list, possibly modified by later configuration,
is available via the function `process-contact'.</p>
<p>
Examples:</p>
<p>
(make-serial-process :port "/dev/ttyS0" :speed 9600)</p>
<p>
(make-serial-process :port "COM1" :speed 115200 :stopbits 2)</p>
<p>
(make-serial-process :port "\\.\COM13" :speed 1200 :bytesize 7 :parity 'odd)</p>
<p>
(make-serial-process :port "/dev/tty.BlueConsole-SPP-1" :speed nil)</p>

(fn &rest ARGS)<a name="multi-occur"></a>
<h3>Function: multi-occur</h3>
Show all lines in buffers BUFS containing a match for REGEXP.
This function acts on multiple buffers; otherwise, it is exactly like
`occur'.  When you invoke this command interactively, you must specify
the buffer names that you want, one by one.
See also `multi-occur-in-matching-buffers'.<a name="set-frame-configuration"></a>
<h3>Function: set-frame-configuration</h3>
Restore the frames to the state described by CONFIGURATION.
Each frame listed in CONFIGURATION has its position, size, window
configuration, and other parameters set as specified in CONFIGURATION.
However, this function does not restore deleted frames.</p>
<p>
Ordinarily, this function deletes all existing frames not
listed in CONFIGURATION.  But if optional second argument NODELETE
is given and non-nil, the unwanted frames are iconified instead.<a name="compilation-start"></a>
<h3>Function: compilation-start</h3>
Run compilation command COMMAND (low level interface).
If COMMAND starts with a cd command, that becomes the `default-directory'.
The rest of the arguments are optional; for them, nil means use the default.</p>
<p>
MODE is the major mode to set in the compilation buffer.  Mode
may also be t meaning use `compilation-shell-minor-mode' under `comint-mode'.</p>
<p>
If NAME-FUNCTION is non-nil, call it with one argument (the mode name)
to determine the buffer name.  Otherwise, the default is to
reuses the current buffer if it has the proper major mode,
else use or create a buffer with name based on the major mode.</p>
<p>
If HIGHLIGHT-REGEXP is non-nil, `next-error' will temporarily highlight
the matching section of the visited source line; the default is to use the
global value of `compilation-highlight-regexp'.</p>
<p>
Returns the compilation buffer created.<a name="checkdoc"></a>
<h3>Function: checkdoc</h3>
Interactively check the entire buffer for style errors.
The current status of the check will be displayed in a buffer which
the users will view as each check is completed.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="log"></a>
<h3>Function: log</h3>
Return the natural logarithm of ARG.
If the optional argument BASE is given, return log ARG using that base.</p>
<p>
(fn ARG &optional BASE)<a name="flycheck-encrypted-buffer-p"></a>

<h3>Function: derived-mode-p</h3>
Non-nil if the current major mode is derived from one of MODES.
Uses the `derived-mode-parent' property of the symbol to trace backwards.<a name="next-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: next-frame</h3>
Return the next frame in the frame list after FRAME.
It considers only frames on the same terminal as FRAME.
By default, skip minibuffer-only frames.
If omitted, FRAME defaults to the selected frame.
If optional argument MINIFRAME is nil, exclude minibuffer-only frames.
If MINIFRAME is a window, include only its own frame
and any frame now using that window as the minibuffer.
If MINIFRAME is `visible', include all visible frames.
If MINIFRAME is 0, include all visible and iconified frames.
Otherwise, include all frames.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FRAME MINIFRAME)<a name="encode-coding-string"></a>
<h3>Function: encode-coding-string</h3>
Encode STRING to CODING-SYSTEM, and return the result.</p>
<p>
Optional third arg NOCOPY non-nil means it is OK to return STRING
itself if the encoding operation is trivial.</p>
<p>
Optional fourth arg BUFFER non-nil means that the encoded text is
inserted in that buffer after point (point does not move).  In this
case, the return value is the length of the encoded text.</p>
<p>
This function sets `last-coding-system-used' to the precise coding system
used (which may be different from CODING-SYSTEM if CODING-SYSTEM is
not fully specified.)</p>
<p>
(fn STRING CODING-SYSTEM &optional NOCOPY BUFFER)<a name="json-read-object"></a>
<h3>Function: json-read-object</h3>
Read the JSON object at point.<a name="mailcap-viewer-passes-test"></a>
<h3>Function: mailcap-viewer-passes-test</h3>
Return non-nil if viewer specified by VIEWER-INFO passes its test clause.
Also return non-nil if it has no test clause.  TYPE-INFO is an argument
to supply to the test.<a name="diff-delete-trailing-whitespace"></a>
<h3>Function: diff-delete-trailing-whitespace</h3>
Remove trailing whitespace from lines modified in this diff.
This edits both the current Diff mode buffer and the patched
source file(s).  If `diff-jump-to-old-file' is non-nil, edit the
original (unpatched) source file instead.  With a prefix argument
OTHER-FILE, flip the choice of which source file to edit.</p>
<p>
If a file referenced in the diff has no buffer and needs to be
fixed, visit it in a buffer.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional OTHER-FILE)<a name="lisp-indent-line"></a>
<h3>Function: lisp-indent-line</h3>
Indent current line as Lisp code.
With argument, indent any additional lines of the same expression
rigidly along with this one.<a name="calculate-lisp-indent"></a>
<h3>Function: calculate-lisp-indent</h3>
Return appropriate indentation for current line as Lisp code.
In usual case returns an integer: the column to indent to.
If the value is nil, that means don't change the indentation
because the line starts inside a string.</p>
<p>
The value can also be a list of the form (COLUMN CONTAINING-SEXP-START).
This means that following lines at the same level of indentation
should not necessarily be indented the same as this line.
Then COLUMN is the column to indent to, and CONTAINING-SEXP-START
is the buffer position of the start of the containing expression.<a name="nonincremental-re-search-backward"></a>
<h3>Function: nonincremental-re-search-backward</h3>
Read a regular expression and search backward for it nonincrementally.<a name="isearch-query-replace"></a>
<h3>Function: isearch-query-replace</h3>
Start `query-replace' with string to replace from last search string.
The arg DELIMITED (prefix arg if interactive), if non-nil, means replace
only matches surrounded by word boundaries.  Note that using the prefix arg
is possible only when `isearch-allow-scroll' is non-nil, and it doesn't
always provide the correct matches for `query-replace', so the preferred
way to run word replacements from Isearch is `M-s w ... M-%'.<a name="face-at-point"></a>
<h3>Function: face-at-point</h3>
Return the face of the character after point.
If it has more than one face, return the first one.
Return nil if it has no specified face.<a name="timerp"></a>
<h3>Function: timerp</h3>
Return t if OBJECT is a timer.<a name="json-encode"></a>
<h3>Function: json-encode</h3>
Return a JSON representation of OBJECT as a string.<a name="ert--string-position"></a>
<h3>Function: ert--string-position</h3>
Return the position of the first occurrence of C in S, or nil if none.<a name="server-add-client"></a>
<h3>Function: server-add-client</h3>
Create a client for process PROC, if it doesn't already have one.
New clients have no properties.</p>
<p>
(fn PROC)<a name="list-matching-lines"></a>
<h3>Function: list-matching-lines</h3>
Show all lines in the current buffer containing a match for REGEXP.
If a match spreads across multiple lines, all those lines are shown.</p>
<p>
Each line is displayed with NLINES lines before and after, or -NLINES
before if NLINES is negative.
NLINES defaults to `list-matching-lines-default-context-lines'.
Interactively it is the prefix arg.</p>
<p>
The lines are shown in a buffer named `*Occur*'.
It serves as a menu to find any of the occurrences in this buffer.
C-h m in that buffer will explain how.</p>
<p>
If REGEXP contains upper case characters (excluding those preceded by `\')
and `search-upper-case' is non-nil, the matching is case-sensitive.</p>
<p>
When NLINES is a string or when the function is called
interactively with prefix argument without a number (`C-u' alone
as prefix) the matching strings are collected into the `*Occur*'
buffer by using NLINES as a replacement regexp.  NLINES may
contain \& and \N which convention follows `replace-match'.
For example, providing "defun\s +\(\S +\)" for REGEXP and
"\1" for NLINES collects all the function names in a lisp
program.  When there is no parenthesized subexpressions in REGEXP
the entire match is collected.  In any case the searched buffer
is not modified.<a name="facemenu-set-face-from-menu"></a>
<h3>Function: facemenu-set-face-from-menu</h3>
Set the FACE of the region or next character typed.
This function is designed to be called from a menu; FACE is determined
using the event type of the menu entry.  If FACE is a symbol whose
name starts with "fg:" or "bg:", then this functions sets the
foreground or background to the color specified by the rest of the
symbol's name.  Any other symbol is considered the name of a face.</p>
<p>
If the region is active (normally true except in Transient Mark mode)
and there is no prefix argument, this command sets the region to the
requested face.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, this command specifies the face for the next character
inserted.  Moving point or switching buffers before typing a character
to insert cancels the specification.<a name="iconify-or-deiconify-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: iconify-or-deiconify-frame</h3>
Iconify the selected frame, or deiconify if it's currently an icon.<a name="lwarn"></a>
<h3>Function: lwarn</h3>
Display a warning message made from (format MESSAGE ARGS...).
Aside from generating the message with `format',
this is equivalent to `display-warning'.</p>
<p>
TYPE is the warning type: either a custom group name (a symbol),
or a list of symbols whose first element is a custom group name.
(The rest of the symbols represent subcategories and
can be whatever you like.)</p>
<p>
LEVEL should be either :debug, :warning, :error, or :emergency
(but see `warning-minimum-level' and `warning-minimum-log-level').</p>
<p>
:emergency -- a problem that will seriously impair Emacs operation soon
	      if you do not attend to it promptly.
:error     -- invalid data or circumstances.
:warning   -- suspicious data or circumstances.
:debug     -- info for debugging only.<a name="linum-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: linum-mode</h3>
Toggle display of line numbers in the left margin (Linum mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Linum mode if ARG is positive,
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode
if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Linum mode is a buffer-local minor mode.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="ebnf-eps-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: ebnf-eps-buffer</h3>
Generate a PostScript syntactic chart image of the buffer in an EPS file.</p>
<p>
Generate an EPS file for each production in the buffer.
The EPS file name has the following form:</p>
<p>
   <PREFIX><PRODUCTION>.eps</p>
<p>
<PREFIX>     is given by variable `ebnf-eps-prefix'.
	     The default value is "ebnf--".</p>
<p>
<PRODUCTION> is the production name.
	     Some characters in the production file name are replaced to
	     produce a valid file name.  For example, the production name
	     "A/B + C" is modified to produce "A_B_+_C", and the EPS
	     file name used in this case will be "ebnf--A_B_+_C.eps".</p>

(fn)<a name="add-text-properties"></a>
<h3>Function: add-text-properties</h3>
Add properties to the text from START to END.
The third argument PROPERTIES is a property list
specifying the property values to add.  If the optional fourth argument
OBJECT is a buffer (or nil, which means the current buffer),
START and END are buffer positions (integers or markers).
If OBJECT is a string, START and END are 0-based indices into it.

<p>
(fn SEQ [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="disable-timeout"></a>
<h3>Function: disable-timeout</h3>
Remove TIMER from the list of active timers.<a name="class-name"></a>
<h3>Function: class-name</h3>
Return a Lisp like symbol name for CLASS.<a name="forward-line"></a>
<h3>Function: forward-line</h3>
Move N lines forward (backward if N is negative).
Precisely, if point is on line I, move to the start of line I + N
("start of line" in the logical order).
If there isn't room, go as far as possible (no error).
Returns the count of lines left to move.  If moving forward,
that is N - number of lines moved; if backward, N + number moved.
With positive N, a non-empty line at the end counts as one line
successfully moved (for the return value).</p>
<p>

Reverse LIST by modifying cdr pointers.
Return the reversed list.  Expects a properly nil-terminated list.</p>

`snapshot' any current `comint-last-prompt-overlay'.
Freeze its attributes in place, even when more input comes along
and moves the prompt overlay.</p>
<p>

Repair a broken attribution line.
If NODISPLAY is non-nil, don't redisplay the article buffer.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional NODISPLAY)<a name="walk-window-tree"></a>
<h3>Function: walk-window-tree</h3>
Run function FUN on each live window of FRAME.
FUN must be a function with one argument - a window.  FRAME must
be a live frame and defaults to the selected one.  ANY, if
non-nil, means to run FUN on all live and internal windows of
FRAME.</p>
<p>
Optional argument MINIBUF t means run FUN on FRAME's minibuffer
window even if it isn't active.  MINIBUF nil or omitted means run
FUN on FRAME's minibuffer window only if it's active.  In both
cases the minibuffer window must be part of FRAME.  MINIBUF
neither nil nor t means never run FUN on the minibuffer window.</p>
<p>
This function performs a pre-order, depth-first traversal of the
window tree.  If FUN changes the window tree, the result is
unpredictable.<a name="read-key"></a>
<h3>Function: read-key</h3>
Read a key from the keyboard.
Contrary to `read-event' this will not return a raw event but instead will
obey the input decoding and translations usually done by `read-key-sequence'.
So escape sequences and keyboard encoding are taken into account.
When there's an ambiguity because the key looks like the prefix of
some sort of escape sequence, the ambiguity is resolved via `read-key-delay'.<a name="string-trim-right"></a>
<h3>Function: string-trim-right</h3>
Remove trailing whitespace from STRING.<a name="ewoc-collect"></a>
<h3>Function: ewoc-collect</h3>
Select elements from EWOC using PREDICATE.
Return a list of all selected data elements.
PREDICATE is a function that takes a data element as its first
argument.  The elements on the returned list will appear in the
same order as in the buffer.  You should not rely on the order of
calls to PREDICATE.
Note that the buffer the EWOC is displayed in is the current
buffer when PREDICATE is called.  PREDICATE must restore it if it
changes it.
If more than two arguments are given the
remaining arguments will be passed to PREDICATE.</p>

Create a new, empty abbrev table object.
PROPS is a list of properties.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional PROPS)<a name="generic-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: generic-mode</h3>
Enter generic mode MODE.</p>
<p>
Generic modes provide basic comment and font-lock functionality
for "generic" files.  (Files which are too small to warrant their
own mode, but have comment characters, keywords, and the like.)</p>
<p>
To define a generic-mode, use the function `define-generic-mode'.
Some generic modes are defined in `generic-x.el'.</p>
<p>
(fn MODE)<a name="copy-file-locals-to-dir-locals"></a>
<h3>Function: copy-file-locals-to-dir-locals</h3>
Copy file-local variables to .dir-locals.el.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="display-buffer-in-previous-window"></a>
<h3>Function: display-buffer-in-previous-window</h3>
Display BUFFER in a window previously showing it.
If ALIST has a non-nil `inhibit-same-window' entry, the selected
window is not eligible for reuse.</p>
<p>
If ALIST contains a `reusable-frames' entry, its value determines
which frames to search for a reusable window:
  nil -- the selected frame (actually the last non-minibuffer frame)
  A frame   -- just that frame
  `visible' -- all visible frames
  0   -- all frames on the current terminal
  t   -- all frames.</p>
<p>
If ALIST contains no `reusable-frames' entry, search just the
selected frame if `display-buffer-reuse-frames' and
`pop-up-frames' are both nil; search all frames on the current
terminal if either of those variables is non-nil.</p>
<p>
If ALIST has a `previous-window' entry, the window specified by
that entry will override any other window found by the methods
above, even if that window never showed BUFFER before.<a name="car-less-than-car"></a>
<h3>Function: car-less-than-car</h3>
Return t if (car A) is numerically less than (car B).</p>

(fn A B)<a name="byte-optimize-quote"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-optimize-quote</h3></p>
<p>

(fn FORM)<a name="tooltip-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: tooltip-mode</h3>
Toggle Tooltip mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Tooltip mode if ARG is positive,
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode
if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When this global minor mode is enabled, Emacs displays help
text (e.g. for buttons and menu items that you put the mouse on)
in a pop-up window.</p>
<p>
When Tooltip mode is disabled, Emacs displays help text in the
echo area, instead of making a pop-up window.<a name="url-get-normalized-date"></a>
<h3>Function: url-get-normalized-date</h3>
Return a 'real' date string that most HTTP servers can understand.<a name="ucs-normalize-NFKD-string"></a>
<h3>Function: ucs-normalize-NFKD-string</h3>

<p>
(fn STR)<a name="decode-coding-inserted-region"></a>
<h3>Function: decode-coding-inserted-region</h3>
Decode the region between FROM and TO as if it is read from file FILENAME.
The idea is that the text between FROM and TO was just inserted somehow.
Optional arguments VISIT, BEG, END, and REPLACE are the same as those
of the function `insert-file-contents'.
Part of the job of this function is setting `buffer-undo-list' appropriately.<a name="event-modifiers"></a>
<h3>Function: event-modifiers</h3>
Return a list of symbols representing the modifier keys in event EVENT.
The elements of the list may include `meta', `control',
`shift', `hyper', `super', `alt', `click', `double', `triple', `drag',
and `down'.
EVENT may be an event or an event type.  If EVENT is a symbol
that has never been used in an event that has been read as input
in the current Emacs session, then this function may fail to include
the `click' modifier.<a name="-some"></a>
<h3>Function: -some</h3>
Return (PRED x) for the first LIST item where (PRED x) is non-nil, else nil.</p>

(fn)<a name="eshell-command-result"></a>
<h3>Function: eshell-command-result</h3>
Execute the given Eshell COMMAND, and return the result.
The result might be any Lisp object.
If STATUS-VAR is a symbol, it will be set to the exit status of the
command.  This is the only way to determine whether the value returned
corresponding to a successful execution.</p>
<p>
(fn COMMAND &optional STATUS-VAR)<a name="custom-check-theme"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-check-theme</h3>
Check whether THEME is valid, and signal an error if it is not.<a name="handle-save-session"></a>
<h3>Function: handle-save-session</h3>
Handle the save_yourself event from a session manager.
A session manager can tell Emacs that the window system is shutting down
by sending Emacs a save_yourself message.  Emacs executes this function when
such an event occurs.  This function then executes `emacs-session-save'.
After that, this function informs the session manager that it can continue
or abort shutting down the window system depending on the return value
from `emacs-session-save'  If the return value is non-nil the session manager
is told to abort the window system shutdown.</p>
<p>
Do not call this function yourself.</p>
<p>
(fn EVENT)<a name="next-window"></a>
<h3>Function: next-window</h3>
Return live window after WINDOW in the cyclic ordering of windows.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.  The
optional arguments MINIBUF and ALL-FRAMES specify the set of windows to
consider.</p>
<p>
MINIBUF nil or omitted means consider the minibuffer window only if the
minibuffer is active.  MINIBUF t means consider the minibuffer window
even if the minibuffer is not active.  Any other value means do not
consider the minibuffer window even if the minibuffer is active.</p>
<p>
ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted means consider all windows on WINDOW's frame,
plus the minibuffer window if specified by the MINIBUF argument.  If the
minibuffer counts, consider all windows on all frames that share that
minibuffer too.  The following non-nil values of ALL-FRAMES have special
meanings:</p>
<p>
- t means consider all windows on all existing frames.</p>
<p>
- `visible' means consider all windows on all visible frames.</p>
<p>
- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible and
  iconified frames.</p>
<p>
- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.</p>
<p>
Anything else means consider all windows on WINDOW's frame and no
others.</p>
<p>
If you use consistent values for MINIBUF and ALL-FRAMES, you can use
`next-window' to iterate through the entire cycle of acceptable
windows, eventually ending up back at the window you started with.
`previous-window' traverses the same cycle, in the reverse order.</p>

<p>
(fn GROUP &optional ARTICLES)<a name="highlight-phrase"></a>
<h3>Function: highlight-phrase</h3>
Set face of each match of phrase REGEXP to FACE.
If called interactively, replaces whitespace in REGEXP with
arbitrary whitespace and makes initial lower-case letters case-insensitive.</p>
<p>
If Font Lock mode is enabled in the buffer, it is used to
highlight REGEXP.  If Font Lock mode is disabled, overlays are
used for highlighting; in this case, the highlighting will not be
updated as you type.</p>
<p>
(fn REGEXP &optional FACE)<a name="custom-group-state-update"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-group-state-update</h3>
Update magic.<a name="server-eval-at"></a>
<h3>Function: server-eval-at</h3>
Contact the Emacs server named SERVER and evaluate FORM there.
Returns the result of the evaluation, or signals an error if it
cannot contact the specified server.  For example:
  (server-eval-at "server" '(emacs-pid))
returns the process ID of the Emacs instance running "server".</p>
<p>

(fn FROM TO FONT-OBJECT STRING)<a name="autoload"></a>
<h3>Function: autoload</h3>
Define FUNCTION to autoload from FILE.
FUNCTION is a symbol; FILE is a file name string to pass to `load'.
Third arg DOCSTRING is documentation for the function.
Fourth arg INTERACTIVE if non-nil says function can be called interactively.
Fifth arg TYPE indicates the type of the object:
   nil or omitted says FUNCTION is a function,
   `keymap' says FUNCTION is really a keymap, and
   `macro' or t says FUNCTION is really a macro.
Third through fifth args give info about the real definition.
They default to nil.
If FUNCTION is already defined other than as an autoload,
this does nothing and returns nil.</p>

<h3>Function: xml-find-file-coding-system</h3>
Determine the coding system of an XML file without a declaration.
Strictly speaking, the file should be utf-8, but mistakes are
made, and there are genuine cases where XML fragments are saved,
with the encoding properly specified in a master document, or
added by processing software.<a name="flycheck-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-mode</h3>
Minor mode for on-the-fly syntax checking.</p>
<p>
When called interactively, toggle `flycheck-mode'.  With prefix
ARG, enable `flycheck-mode' if ARG is positive, otherwise disable

<h3>Function: edit-abbrevs</h3>
Alter abbrev definitions by editing a list of them.
Selects a buffer containing a list of abbrev definitions with
point located in the abbrev table of current buffer.
You can edit them and type C-c C-c to redefine abbrevs
according to your editing.
Buffer contains a header line for each abbrev table,
 which is the abbrev table name in parentheses.
This is followed by one line per abbrev in that table:
NAME   USECOUNT   EXPANSION   HOOK
where NAME and EXPANSION are strings with quotes,
USECOUNT is an integer, and HOOK is any valid function
or may be omitted (it is usually omitted).</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="reftex-citation"></a>
<h3>Function: reftex-citation</h3>
Make a citation using BibTeX database files.
After prompting for a regular expression, scans the buffers with
bibtex entries (taken from the \bibliography command) and offers the
matching entries for selection.  The selected entry is formatted according
to `reftex-cite-format' and inserted into the buffer.</p>
<p>
If NO-INSERT is non-nil, nothing is inserted, only the selected key returned.</p>
<p>
FORMAT-KEY can be used to pre-select a citation format.</p>
<p>
When called with a `C-u' prefix, prompt for optional arguments in
cite macros.  When called with a numeric prefix, make that many
citations.  When called with point inside the braces of a `\cite'
command, it will add another key, ignoring the value of
`reftex-cite-format'.</p>
<p>
The regular expression uses an expanded syntax: && is interpreted as `and'.
Thus, `aaaa&&bbb' matches entries which contain both `aaaa' and `bbb'.
While entering the regexp, completion on knows citation keys is possible.
`=' is a good regular expression to match all entries in all files.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional NO-INSERT FORMAT-KEY)<a name="edebug-defun"></a>
<h3>Function: edebug-defun</h3>
Evaluate the top level form point is in, stepping through with Edebug.
This is like `eval-defun' except that it steps the code for Edebug
before evaluating it.  It displays the value in the echo area
using `eval-expression' (which see).</p>
<p>
If you do this on a function definition such as a defun or defmacro,
it defines the function and instruments its definition for Edebug,
so it will do Edebug stepping when called later.  It displays
`Edebug: FUNCTION' in the echo area to indicate that FUNCTION is now
instrumented for Edebug.</p>
<p>
If the current defun is actually a call to `defvar' or `defcustom',
evaluating it this way resets the variable using its initial value
expression even if the variable already has some other value.
(Normally `defvar' and `defcustom' do not alter the value if there
already is one.)</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="view-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: view-buffer</h3>
View BUFFER in View mode, returning to previous buffer when done.
Emacs commands editing the buffer contents are not available; instead, a
special set of commands (mostly letters and punctuation) are defined for
moving around in the buffer.
Space scrolls forward, Delete scrolls backward.
For a list of all View commands, type H or h while viewing.</p>
<p>
This command runs the normal hook `view-mode-hook'.</p>
<p>
Optional argument EXIT-ACTION is either nil or a function with buffer as
argument.  This function is called when finished viewing buffer.  Use
this argument instead of explicitly setting `view-exit-action'.</p>
<p>
Do not set EXIT-ACTION to `kill-buffer' when BUFFER visits a
file: Users may suspend viewing in order to modify the buffer.
Exiting View mode will then discard the user's edits.  Setting
EXIT-ACTION to `kill-buffer-if-not-modified' avoids this.</p>
<p>
This function does not enable View mode if the buffer's major-mode
has a `special' mode-class, because such modes usually have their
own View-like bindings.</p>
<p>
(fn BUFFER &optional EXIT-ACTION)<a name="Custom-reset-saved"></a>
<h3>Function: Custom-reset-saved</h3>
Reset all edited or set settings in the buffer to their saved value.
This also shows the saved values in the buffer.<a name="checkdoc-defun"></a>
<h3>Function: checkdoc-defun</h3>
Examine the doc string of the function or variable under point.
Call `error' if the doc string has problems.  If NO-ERROR is
non-nil, then do not call error, but call `message' instead.
If the doc string passes the test, then check the function for rogue white
space at the end of each line.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional NO-ERROR)<a name="autoarg-kp-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: autoarg-kp-mode</h3>
Toggle Autoarg-KP mode, a global minor mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Autoarg-KP mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `autoarg-kp-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
This is similar to `autoarg-mode' but rebinds the keypad keys
`kp-1' etc. to supply digit arguments.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `autoarg-kp-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: recenter-top-bottom</h3>
Move current buffer line to the specified window line.
With no prefix argument, successive calls place point according
to the cycling order defined by `recenter-positions'.</p>
<p>
A prefix argument is handled like `recenter':
 With numeric prefix ARG, move current line to window-line ARG.
 With plain `C-u', move current line to window center.<a name="---truthy?"></a>

move to with the same argument.
Interactively, if this command is repeated
or (in Transient Mark mode) if the mark is active,
it marks the next ARG words after the ones already marked.<a name="boundp"></a>

(fn DIR)<a name="completion-table-dynamic"></a>
<h3>Function: completion-table-dynamic</h3>
Use function FUN as a dynamic completion table.
FUN is called with one argument, the string for which completion is required,
and it should return an alist containing all the intended possible completions.
This alist may be a full list of possible completions so that FUN can ignore
the value of its argument.  If completion is performed in the minibuffer,
FUN will be called in the buffer from which the minibuffer was entered.</p>
<p>
The result of the `completion-table-dynamic' form is a function
that can be used as the COLLECTION argument to `try-completion' and
`all-completions'.  See Info node `(elisp)Programmed Completion'.</p>
<p>
(fn FUN)<a name="window-dot"></a>
<h3>Function: window-dot</h3>
Return current value of point in WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
For a nonselected window, this is the value point would have if that
window were selected.</p>
<p>
Note that, when WINDOW is selected, the value returned is the same as
that returned by `point' for WINDOW's buffer.  It would be more strictly
correct to return the `top-level' value of `point', outside of any
`save-excursion' forms.  But that is hard to define.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WINDOW)<a name="unintern"></a>
<h3>Function: unintern</h3>
Delete the symbol named NAME, if any, from OBARRAY.
The value is t if a symbol was found and deleted, nil otherwise.
NAME may be a string or a symbol.  If it is a symbol, that symbol
is deleted, if it belongs to OBARRAY--no other symbol is deleted.
OBARRAY defaults to the value of the variable `obarray'.</p>

<h3>Function: Info-backward-node</h3>
Go backward one node, considering all nodes as forming one sequence.<a name="kmacro-bind-to-key"></a>
<h3>Function: kmacro-bind-to-key</h3>
When not defining or executing a macro, offer to bind last macro to a key.
The key sequences [C-x C-k 0] through [C-x C-k 9] and [C-x C-k A]
through [C-x C-k Z] are reserved for user bindings, and to bind to
one of these sequences, just enter the digit or letter, rather than
the whole sequence.</p>
<p>
You can bind to any valid key sequence, but if you try to bind to
a key with an existing command binding, you will be asked for
confirmation whether to replace that binding.  Note that the
binding is made in the `global-map' keymap, so the macro binding
may be shaded by a local key binding.<a name="cl-coerce"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-coerce</h3>
Coerce OBJECT to type TYPE.
TYPE is a Common Lisp type specifier.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT TYPE)<a name="terminal-emulator"></a>
<h3>Function: terminal-emulator</h3>
Under a display-terminal emulator in BUFFER, run PROGRAM on arguments ARGS.
ARGS is a list of argument-strings.  Remaining arguments are WIDTH and HEIGHT.
BUFFER's contents are made an image of the display generated by that program,
and any input typed when BUFFER is the current Emacs buffer is sent to that
program as keyboard input.</p>
<p>
Interactively, BUFFER defaults to "*terminal*" and PROGRAM and ARGS
are parsed from an input-string using your usual shell.
WIDTH and HEIGHT are determined from the size of the current window
-- WIDTH will be one less than the window's width, HEIGHT will be its height.</p>
<p>
To switch buffers and leave the emulator, or to give commands
to the emulator itself (as opposed to the program running under it),
type Control-^.  The following character is an emulator command.
Type Control-^ twice to send it to the subprogram.
This escape character may be changed using the variable `terminal-escape-char'.</p>
<p>
`Meta' characters may not currently be sent through the terminal emulator.</p>
<p>
Here is a list of some of the variables which control the behavior
of the emulator -- see their documentation for more information:
terminal-escape-char, terminal-scrolling, terminal-more-processing,
terminal-redisplay-interval.</p>
<p>
This function calls the value of terminal-mode-hook if that exists
and is non-nil after the terminal buffer has been set up and the
subprocess started.</p>
<p>
(fn BUFFER PROGRAM ARGS &optional WIDTH HEIGHT)<a name="file-cache-add-file"></a>

<h3>Function: seq--drop-while-list</h3>
Return a list from the first element for which (PREDICATE element) is nil in LIST.
This is an optimization for lists in `seq-drop-while'.</p>
<p>
(fn PREDICATE LIST)<a name="get-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: get-buffer</h3>
Return the buffer named BUFFER-OR-NAME.
BUFFER-OR-NAME must be either a string or a buffer.  If BUFFER-OR-NAME
is a string and there is no buffer with that name, return nil.  If
BUFFER-OR-NAME is a buffer, return it as given.</p>
<p>
(fn BUFFER-OR-NAME)<a name="make-variable-frame-local"></a>
<h3>Function: make-variable-frame-local</h3>
Enable VARIABLE to have frame-local bindings.
This does not create any frame-local bindings for VARIABLE,
it just makes them possible.</p>
<p>
A frame-local binding is actually a frame parameter value.
If a frame F has a value for the frame parameter named VARIABLE,
that also acts as a frame-local binding for VARIABLE in F--
provided this function has been called to enable VARIABLE
to have frame-local bindings at all.</p>
<p>
The only way to create a frame-local binding for VARIABLE in a frame
is to set the VARIABLE frame parameter of that frame.  See
`modify-frame-parameters' for how to set frame parameters.</p>
<p>
Note that since Emacs 23.1, variables cannot be both buffer-local and
frame-local any more (buffer-local bindings used to take precedence over
frame-local bindings).</p>
<p>
(fn VARIABLE)<a name="rx-repeat"></a>
<h3>Function: rx-repeat</h3>
Parse and produce code from FORM.
FORM is either `(repeat N FORM1)' or `(repeat N M FORMS...)'.<a name="mouse-tear-off-window"></a>

<h3>Function: compilation-internal-error-properties</h3>
Get the meta-info that will be added as text-properties.
LINE, END-LINE, COL, END-COL are integers or nil.
TYPE can be 0, 1, or 2, meaning error, warning, or just info.
FILE should be (FILENAME) or (RELATIVE-FILENAME . DIRNAME) or nil.
FMTS is a list of format specs for transforming the file name.

(fn &optional REGEXP PREDICATE)<a name="forth-block-p"></a>
<h3>Function: forth-block-p</h3>
Guess whether the current buffer is a Forth block file.<a name="vc-register"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-register</h3>
Register into a version control system.
If VC-FILESET is given, register the files in that fileset.
Otherwise register the current file.
With prefix argument SET-REVISION, allow user to specify initial revision
level.  If COMMENT is present, use that as an initial comment.</p>
<p>
The version control system to use is found by cycling through the list
`vc-handled-backends'.  The first backend in that list which declares
itself responsible for the file (usually because other files in that
directory are already registered under that backend) will be used to
register the file.  If no backend declares itself responsible, the
first backend that could register the file is used.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional SET-REVISION VC-FILESET COMMENT)<a name="edebug-all-forms"></a>
<h3>Function: edebug-all-forms</h3>
Toggle edebugging of all forms.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="define-translation-table"></a>
<h3>Function: define-translation-table</h3>
Define SYMBOL as the name of translation table made by ARGS.
This sets up information so that the table can be used for
translations in a CCL program.</p>
<p>
If the first element of ARGS is a char-table whose purpose is
`translation-table', just define SYMBOL to name it.  (Note that this
function does not bind SYMBOL.)</p>
<p>
Any other ARGS should be suitable as arguments of the function
`make-translation-table' (which see).</p>
<p>
This function sets properties `translation-table' and
`translation-table-id' of SYMBOL to the created table itself and the
identification number of the table respectively.  It also registers
the table in `translation-table-vector'.<a name="libxml-parse-html-region"></a>
<h3>Function: libxml-parse-html-region</h3>
Parse the region as an HTML document and return the parse tree.

<h3>Function: progress-reporter-done</h3>
Print reporter's message followed by word "done" in echo area.<a name="insert-char"></a>
<h3>Function: insert-char</h3>
Insert COUNT copies of CHARACTER.
Interactively, prompt for CHARACTER.  You can specify CHARACTER in one
of these ways:</p>
<p>
 - As its Unicode character name, e.g. "LATIN SMALL LETTER A".
   Completion is available; if you type a substring of the name
   preceded by an asterisk `*', Emacs shows all names which include
   that substring, not necessarily at the beginning of the name.</p>
<p>
 - As a hexadecimal code point, e.g. 263A.  Note that code points in
   Emacs are equivalent to Unicode up to 10FFFF (which is the limit of
   the Unicode code space).</p>
<p>
 - As a code point with a radix specified with #, e.g. #o21430
   (octal), #x2318 (hex), or #10r8984 (decimal).</p>
<p>
If called interactively, COUNT is given by the prefix argument.  If
omitted or nil, it defaults to 1.</p>
<p>
Inserting the character(s) relocates point and before-insertion
markers in the same ways as the function `insert'.</p>
<p>
The optional third argument INHERIT, if non-nil, says to inherit text
properties from adjoining text, if those properties are sticky.  If
called interactively, INHERIT is t.</p>
<p>
(fn CHARACTER &optional COUNT INHERIT)<a name="constrain-to-field"></a>
<h3>Function: constrain-to-field</h3>
Return the position closest to NEW-POS that is in the same field as OLD-POS.
A field is a region of text with the same `field' property.</p>
<p>
If NEW-POS is nil, then use the current point instead, and move point
to the resulting constrained position, in addition to returning that
position.</p>
<p>
If OLD-POS is at the boundary of two fields, then the allowable
positions for NEW-POS depends on the value of the optional argument
ESCAPE-FROM-EDGE: If ESCAPE-FROM-EDGE is nil, then NEW-POS is
constrained to the field that has the same `field' char-property
as any new characters inserted at OLD-POS, whereas if ESCAPE-FROM-EDGE
is non-nil, NEW-POS is constrained to the union of the two adjacent
fields.  Additionally, if two fields are separated by another field with
the special value `boundary', then any point within this special field is
also considered to be `on the boundary'.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument ONLY-IN-LINE is non-nil and constraining
NEW-POS would move it to a different line, NEW-POS is returned
unconstrained.  This useful for commands that move by line, like
C-n or M-x beginning-of-line, which should generally respect field boundaries
only in the case where they can still move to the right line.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument INHIBIT-CAPTURE-PROPERTY is non-nil, and OLD-POS has
a non-nil property of that name, then any field boundaries are ignored.</p>
<p>
Field boundaries are not noticed if `inhibit-field-text-motion' is non-nil.</p>
<p>
(fn NEW-POS OLD-POS &optional ESCAPE-FROM-EDGE ONLY-IN-LINE INHIBIT-CAPTURE-PROPERTY)<a name="compilation-find-file"></a>
<h3>Function: compilation-find-file</h3>
Find a buffer for file FILENAME.
If FILENAME is not found at all, ask the user where to find it.
Pop up the buffer containing MARKER and scroll to MARKER if we ask
the user where to find the file.
Search the directories in `compilation-search-path'.
A nil in `compilation-search-path' means to try the
"current" directory, which is passed in DIRECTORY.
If DIRECTORY is relative, it is combined with `default-directory'.
If DIRECTORY is nil, that means use `default-directory'.
FORMATS, if given, is a list of formats to reformat FILENAME when
looking for it: for each element FMT in FORMATS, this function
attempts to find a file whose name is produced by (format FMT FILENAME).<a name="dired-goto-file"></a>

<h3>Function: ccl-compile</h3>
Return the compiled code of CCL-PROGRAM as a vector of integers.</p>
<p>
(fn CCL-PROGRAM)<a name="bookmark-save"></a>
<h3>Function: bookmark-save</h3>
Save currently defined bookmarks.
Saves by default in the file defined by the variable
`bookmark-default-file'.  With a prefix arg, save it in file FILE
(second argument).</p>
<p>
If you are calling this from Lisp, the two arguments are PARG and
FILE, and if you just want it to write to the default file, then
pass no arguments.  Or pass in nil and FILE, and it will save in FILE
instead.  If you pass in one argument, and it is non-nil, then the
user will be interactively queried for a file to save in.</p>
<p>
When you want to load in the bookmarks from a file, use
`bookmark-load', M-x bookmark-load.  That function will prompt you
for a file, defaulting to the file defined by variable
`bookmark-default-file'.</p>

Non-nil if SYM is safe as a file-local variable with value VAL.
It is safe if any of these conditions are met:</p>
<p>
 * There is a matching entry (SYM . VAL) in the

<p>
 * The `safe-local-variable' property of SYM is a function that

<p>
(fn CLASS &optional HEADERFCN)<a name="c-set-style"></a>
<h3>Function: c-set-style</h3>
Set the current buffer to use the style STYLENAME.
STYLENAME, a string, must be an existing CC Mode style - These are contained
in the variable `c-style-alist'.</p>
<p>
The variable `c-indentation-style' will get set to STYLENAME.</p>
<p>
"Setting the style" is done by setting CC Mode's "style variables" to the
values indicated by the pertinent entry in `c-style-alist'.  Other variables
might get set too.</p>
<p>
If DONT-OVERRIDE is neither nil nor t, style variables whose default values
have been set (more precisely, whose default values are not the symbol
`set-from-style') will not be changed.  This avoids overriding global settings
done in your init file.  It is useful to call c-set-style from a mode hook
in this way.</p>
<p>
If DONT-OVERRIDE is t, style variables that already have values (i.e., whose
values are not the symbol `set-from-style') will not be overridden.  CC Mode
calls c-set-style internally in this way whilst initializing a buffer; if
cc-set-style is called like this from anywhere else, it will usually behave as
a null operation.</p>

`browse-url-mozilla-arguments' are also passed to Mozilla.</p>
<p>
When called interactively, if variable `browse-url-new-window-flag' is
non-nil, load the document in a new Mozilla window, otherwise use a
random existing one.  A non-nil interactive prefix argument reverses
the effect of `browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
If `browse-url-mozilla-new-window-is-tab' is non-nil, then whenever a
document would otherwise be loaded in a new window, it is loaded in a
new tab in an existing window instead.</p>
<p>
When called non-interactively, optional second argument NEW-WINDOW is
used instead of `browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
(fn URL &optional NEW-WINDOW)<a name="read-number"></a>

<p>
(fn)<a name="run-at-time"></a>
<h3>Function: run-at-time</h3>
Perform an action at time TIME.
Repeat the action every REPEAT seconds, if REPEAT is non-nil.
TIME should be one of: a string giving an absolute time like
"11:23pm" (the acceptable formats are those recognized by
`diary-entry-time'; note that such times are interpreted as times
today, even if in the past); a string giving a relative time like
"2 hours 35 minutes" (the acceptable formats are those
recognized by `timer-duration'); nil meaning now; a number of
seconds from now; a value from `encode-time'; or t (with non-nil
REPEAT) meaning the next integral multiple of REPEAT.  REPEAT may
be an integer or floating point number.  The action is to call
FUNCTION with arguments ARGS.</p>
<p>
This function returns a timer object which you can use in `cancel-timer'.<a name="window--side-check"></a>
<h3>Function: window--side-check</h3>
Check the side window configuration of FRAME.
FRAME defaults to the selected frame.</p>
<p>
A valid side window configuration preserves the following two
invariants:</p>
<p>
- If there exists a window whose window-side parameter is
  non-nil, there must exist at least one live window whose
  window-side parameter is nil.</p>
<p>
- If a window W has a non-nil window-side parameter (i) it must
  have a parent window and that parent's window-side parameter
  must be either nil or the same as for W, and (ii) any child
  window of W must have the same window-side parameter as W.</p>
<p>
If the configuration is invalid, reset the window-side parameters
of all windows on FRAME to nil.<a name="end-of-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: end-of-buffer</h3>
Move point to the end of the buffer.
With numeric arg N, put point N/10 of the way from the end.
If the buffer is narrowed, this command uses the end of the
accessible part of the buffer.</p>
<p>
If Transient Mark mode is disabled, leave mark at previous
position, unless a C-u prefix is supplied.</p>
<p>
Don't use this command in Lisp programs!
(goto-char (point-max)) is faster.<a name="-find-index"></a>
<h3>Function: -find-index</h3>

<h3>Function: x-show-tip</h3>
Show STRING in a "tooltip" window on frame FRAME.
A tooltip window is a small X window displaying a string.</p>
<p>
This is an internal function; Lisp code should call `tooltip-show'.</p>
<p>
FRAME nil or omitted means use the selected frame.</p>
<p>
PARMS is an optional list of frame parameters which can be used to
change the tooltip's appearance.</p>
<p>
Automatically hide the tooltip after TIMEOUT seconds.  TIMEOUT nil
means use the default timeout of 5 seconds.</p>
<p>
If the list of frame parameters PARMS contains a `left' parameters,
the tooltip is displayed at that x-position.  Otherwise it is
displayed at the mouse position, with offset DX added (default is 5 if
DX isn't specified).  Likewise for the y-position; if a `top' frame
parameter is specified, it determines the y-position of the tooltip
window, otherwise it is displayed at the mouse position, with offset
DY added (default is -10).</p>
<p>
A tooltip's maximum size is specified by `x-max-tooltip-size'.
Text larger than the specified size is clipped.</p>

<p>
(fn &optional FORCE)<a name="push-button"></a>
<h3>Function: push-button</h3>
Perform the action specified by a button at location POS.
POS may be either a buffer position or a mouse-event.  If
USE-MOUSE-ACTION is non-nil, invoke the button's mouse-action
instead of its normal action; if the button has no mouse-action,
the normal action is used instead.  The action may be either a
function to call or a marker to display.
POS defaults to point, except when `push-button' is invoked
interactively as the result of a mouse-event, in which case, the
mouse event is used.
If there's no button at POS, do nothing and return nil, otherwise
return t.<a name="frame-selected-window"></a>
<h3>Function: frame-selected-window</h3>
Return the selected window of FRAME-OR-WINDOW.
If omitted, FRAME-OR-WINDOW defaults to the currently selected frame.
Else if FRAME-OR-WINDOW denotes a valid window, return the selected
window of that window's frame.  If FRAME-OR-WINDOW denotes a live frame,
return the selected window of that frame.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FRAME-OR-WINDOW)<a name="field-string-no-properties"></a>
<h3>Function: field-string-no-properties</h3>
Return the contents of the field around POS, without text properties.
A field is a region of text with the same `field' property.

On Unix, this is a name starting with a `/' or a `~'.</p>
<p>
(fn FILENAME)<a name="current-active-maps"></a>
<h3>Function: current-active-maps</h3>
Return a list of the currently active keymaps.
OLP if non-nil indicates that we should obey `overriding-local-map' and
`overriding-terminal-local-map'.  POSITION can specify a click position
like in the respective argument of `key-binding'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional OLP POSITION)<a name="flycheck-display-error-messages"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-display-error-messages</h3>
Display the messages of ERRORS.</p>
<p>
Concatenate all non-nil messages of ERRORS separated by empty
lines, and display them with `display-message-or-buffer', which
shows the messages either in the echo area or in a separate
buffer, depending on the number of lines.  See Info
node `(elisp)Displaying Messages' for more information.</p>
<p>
In the latter case, show messages in the buffer denoted by
variable `flycheck-error-message-buffer'.<a name="bookmark-set"></a>
<h3>Function: bookmark-set</h3>
Set a bookmark named NAME at the current location.
If name is nil, then prompt the user.</p>
<p>
With a prefix arg (non-nil NO-OVERWRITE), do not overwrite any
existing bookmark that has the same name as NAME, but instead push the
new bookmark onto the bookmark alist.  The most recently set bookmark
with name NAME is thus the one in effect at any given time, but the
others are still there, should the user decide to delete the most
recent one.</p>
<p>
To yank words from the text of the buffer and use them as part of the
bookmark name, type C-w while setting a bookmark.  Successive C-w's
yank successive words.</p>
<p>
Typing C-u inserts (at the bookmark name prompt) the name of the last
bookmark used in the document where the new bookmark is being set;
this helps you use a single bookmark name to track progress through a
large document.  If there is no prior bookmark for this document, then
C-u inserts an appropriate name based on the buffer or file.</p>
<p>
Use M-x bookmark-delete to remove bookmarks (you give it a name and
it removes only the first instance of a bookmark with that name from
the list of bookmarks.)</p>
<p>
(fn &optional NAME NO-OVERWRITE)<a name="define-key-after"></a>
<h3>Function: define-key-after</h3>
Add binding in KEYMAP for KEY => DEFINITION, right after AFTER's binding.
This is like `define-key' except that the binding for KEY is placed
just after the binding for the event AFTER, instead of at the beginning
of the map.  Note that AFTER must be an event type (like KEY), NOT a command
(like DEFINITION).</p>
<p>
If AFTER is t or omitted, the new binding goes at the end of the keymap.
AFTER should be a single event type--a symbol or a character, not a sequence.</p>
<p>
Bindings are always added before any inherited map.</p>
<p>
The order of bindings in a keymap only matters when it is used as
a menu, so this function is not useful for non-menu keymaps.<a name="window-text-height"></a>
<h3>Function: window-text-height</h3>
Return the height in lines of the text display area of WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
The returned height does not include the mode line, any header line,
nor any partial-height lines at the bottom of the text area.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WINDOW)<a name="encode-time"></a>
<h3>Function: encode-time</h3>
Convert SECOND, MINUTE, HOUR, DAY, MONTH, YEAR and ZONE to internal time.
This is the reverse operation of `decode-time', which see.
ZONE defaults to the current time zone rule.  This can
be a string or t (as from `set-time-zone-rule'), or it can be a list
(as from `current-time-zone') or an integer (as from `decode-time')
applied without consideration for daylight saving time.</p>
<p>
You can pass more than 7 arguments; then the first six arguments
are used as SECOND through YEAR, and the *last* argument is used as ZONE.
The intervening arguments are ignored.
This feature lets (apply 'encode-time (decode-time ...)) work.</p>
<p>
Out-of-range values for SECOND, MINUTE, HOUR, DAY, or MONTH are allowed;
for example, a DAY of 0 means the day preceding the given month.
Year numbers less than 100 are treated just like other year numbers.
If you want them to stand for years in this century, you must do that yourself.</p>
<p>
Years before 1970 are not guaranteed to work.  On some systems,
year values as low as 1901 do work.</p>
<p>
(fn SECOND MINUTE HOUR DAY MONTH YEAR &optional ZONE)<a name="rfc2047-encode-message-header"></a>
<h3>Function: rfc2047-encode-message-header</h3>

<h3>Function: font-menu-add-default</h3></p>
<p>

(fn)<a name="file-modes-char-to-who"></a>
<h3>Function: file-modes-char-to-who</h3>
Convert CHAR to a numeric bit-mask for extracting mode bits.
CHAR is in [ugoa] and represents the category of users (Owner, Group,
Others, or All) for whom to produce the mask.
The bit-mask that is returned extracts from mode bits the access rights
for the specified category of users.<a name="find-file-read-only-other-window"></a>
<h3>Function: find-file-read-only-other-window</h3>
Edit file FILENAME in another window but don't allow changes.
Like C-x 4 C-f, but marks buffer as read-only.
Use M-x toggle-read-only to permit editing.<a name="mail-other-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: mail-other-frame</h3>
Like `mail' command, but display mail buffer in another frame.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional NOERASE TO SUBJECT IN-REPLY-TO CC REPLYBUFFER SENDACTIONS)<a name="antlr-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: antlr-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing ANTLR grammar files.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="compute-motion"></a>
<h3>Function: compute-motion</h3>
Scan through the current buffer, calculating screen position.
Scan the current buffer forward from offset FROM,
assuming it is at position FROMPOS--a cons of the form (HPOS . VPOS)--
to position TO or position TOPOS--another cons of the form (HPOS . VPOS)--
and return the ending buffer position and screen location.</p>
<p>
If TOPOS is nil, the actual width and height of the window's
text area are used.</p>
<p>
There are three additional arguments:</p>
<p>
WIDTH is the number of columns available to display text;
this affects handling of continuation lines.  A value of nil
corresponds to the actual number of available text columns.</p>
<p>
OFFSETS is either nil or a cons cell (HSCROLL . TAB-OFFSET).
HSCROLL is the number of columns not being displayed at the left
margin; this is usually taken from a window's hscroll member.
TAB-OFFSET is the number of columns of the first tab that aren't
being displayed, perhaps because the line was continued within it.
If OFFSETS is nil, HSCROLL and TAB-OFFSET are assumed to be zero.</p>
<p>
WINDOW is the window to operate on.  It is used to choose the display table;
if it is showing the current buffer, it is used also for
deciding which overlay properties apply.
Note that `compute-motion' always operates on the current buffer.</p>
<p>
The value is a list of five elements:
  (POS HPOS VPOS PREVHPOS CONTIN)
POS is the buffer position where the scan stopped.
VPOS is the vertical position where the scan stopped.
HPOS is the horizontal position where the scan stopped.</p>
<p>
PREVHPOS is the horizontal position one character back from POS.
CONTIN is t if a line was continued after (or within) the previous character.</p>
<p>
For example, to find the buffer position of column COL of line LINE
of a certain window, pass the window's starting location as FROM
and the window's upper-left coordinates as FROMPOS.
Pass the buffer's (point-max) as TO, to limit the scan to the end of the
visible section of the buffer, and pass LINE and COL as TOPOS.</p>
<p>
(fn FROM FROMPOS TO TOPOS WIDTH OFFSETS WINDOW)<a name="char-table-range"></a>
<h3>Function: char-table-range</h3>

<h3>Function: map-charset-chars</h3>
Call FUNCTION for all characters in CHARSET.
FUNCTION is called with an argument RANGE and the optional 3rd
argument ARG.</p>
<p>
RANGE is a cons (FROM .  TO), where FROM and TO indicate a range of
characters contained in CHARSET.</p>
<p>
The optional 4th and 5th arguments FROM-CODE and TO-CODE specify the
range of code points (in CHARSET) of target characters.</p>

<p>
Printing characters replace instead of inserting themselves with motion
afterwards settable by these commands:</p>
<p>
 Move left after insertion:            M-x picture-movement-left
 Move right after insertion:           M-x picture-movement-right
 Move up after insertion:              M-x picture-movement-up

 Move westsouthwest (wsw) after insertion:  C-u M-x picture-movement-sw
 Move eastsoutheast (ese) after insertion:  C-u M-x picture-movement-se</p>
<p>
The current direction is displayed in the mode line.  The initial
direction is right.  Whitespace is inserted and tabs are changed to
spaces when required by movement.  You can move around in the buffer
with these commands:</p>
<p>
 Move vertically to SAME column in previous line: M-x picture-move-down
 Move vertically to SAME column in next line:     M-x picture-move-up
 Move to column following last
  non-whitespace character:                       M-x picture-end-of-line
 Move right, inserting spaces if required:        M-x picture-forward-column
 Move left changing tabs to spaces if required:   M-x picture-backward-column
 Move in direction of current picture motion:     M-x picture-motion
 Move opposite to current picture motion:         M-x picture-motion-reverse
 Move to beginning of next line:                  C-n</p>
<p>
You can edit tabular text with these commands:</p>
<p>
 Move to column beneath (or at) next interesting
  character (see variable `picture-tab-chars'):   M-x picture-tab-search
 Move to next stop in tab stop list:              M-x picture-tab
 Set tab stops according to context of this line: M-x picture-set-tab-stops
   (With ARG, resets tab stops to default value.)
 Change the tab stop list:                        M-x edit-tab-stops</p>
<p>
You can manipulate text with these commands:
 Clear ARG columns after point without moving:    M-x picture-clear-column
 Delete char at point:                            M-x picture-delete-char
 Clear ARG columns backward:                      M-x picture-backward-clear-column
 Clear ARG lines, advancing over them:            M-x picture-clear-line
  (the cleared text is saved in the kill ring)
 Open blank line(s) beneath current line:         M-x picture-open-line</p>
<p>
You can manipulate rectangles with these commands:
  Clear a rectangle and save it:                  M-x picture-clear-rectangle
  Clear a rectangle, saving in a named register:  M-x picture-clear-rectangle-to-register

  Copies a rectangle to a register:               C-x r r
  Undo effects of rectangle overlay commands:     C-x u</p>
<p>
You can return to the previous mode with M-x picture-mode-exit, which
also strips trailing whitespace from every line.  Stripping is suppressed
by supplying an argument.</p>
<p>
Entry to this mode calls the value of `picture-mode-hook' if non-nil.</p>
<p>
Note that Picture mode commands will work outside of Picture mode, but
they are not by default assigned to keys.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="replace-match"></a>
<h3>Function: replace-match</h3>
Replace text matched by last search with NEWTEXT.
Leave point at the end of the replacement text.</p>
<p>
If optional second arg FIXEDCASE is non-nil, do not alter the case of
the replacement text.  Otherwise, maybe capitalize the whole text, or
maybe just word initials, based on the replaced text.  If the replaced
text has only capital letters and has at least one multiletter word,
convert NEWTEXT to all caps.  Otherwise if all words are capitalized
in the replaced text, capitalize each word in NEWTEXT.</p>
<p>
If optional third arg LITERAL is non-nil, insert NEWTEXT literally.
Otherwise treat `\' as special:
  `\&' in NEWTEXT means substitute original matched text.
  `\N' means substitute what matched the Nth `\(...\)'.
       If Nth parens didn't match, substitute nothing.
  `\\' means insert one `\'.
  `\?' is treated literally
       (for compatibility with `query-replace-regexp').
  Any other character following `\' signals an error.
Case conversion does not apply to these substitutions.</p>
<p>
If optional fourth argument STRING is non-nil, it should be a string
to act on; this should be the string on which the previous match was
done via `string-match'.  In this case, `replace-match' creates and
returns a new string, made by copying STRING and replacing the part of
STRING that was matched (the original STRING itself is not altered).</p>
<p>
The optional fifth argument SUBEXP specifies a subexpression;
it says to replace just that subexpression with NEWTEXT,
rather than replacing the entire matched text.
This is, in a vague sense, the inverse of using `\N' in NEWTEXT;
`\N' copies subexp N into NEWTEXT, but using N as SUBEXP puts
NEWTEXT in place of subexp N.
This is useful only after a regular expression search or match,
since only regular expressions have distinguished subexpressions.</p>

Process a miscellaneous key sequence in Isearch mode.</p>
<p>
Try to convert the current key-sequence to something usable in Isearch
mode, either by converting it with `function-key-map', downcasing a
key with C-<upper case>, or finding a "scrolling command" bound to
it.  (In the last case, we may have to read more events.)  If so,
either unread the converted sequence or execute the command.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, if `search-exit-option' is non-nil (the default) unread the
key-sequence and exit the search normally.  If it is the symbol
`edit', the search string is edited in the minibuffer and the meta
character is unread so that it applies to editing the string.</p>

with the first command).
This command is like `M-.' in bash.</p>
<p>
(fn INDEX)<a name="package--dir"></a>
<h3>Function: package--dir</h3>
Return the directory where a package is installed, or nil if none.
NAME and VERSION are both strings.<a name="keep-lines"></a>
<h3>Function: keep-lines</h3>
Delete all lines except those containing matches for REGEXP.
A match split across lines preserves all the lines it lies in.
When called from Lisp (and usually interactively as well, see below)
applies to all lines starting after point.</p>
<p>
If REGEXP contains upper case characters (excluding those preceded by `\')
and `search-upper-case' is non-nil, the matching is case-sensitive.</p>
<p>
Second and third arg RSTART and REND specify the region to operate on.
This command operates on (the accessible part of) all lines whose
accessible part is entirely contained in the region determined by RSTART
and REND.  (A newline ending a line counts as part of that line.)</p>
<p>
Interactively, in Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, operate
on all lines whose accessible part is entirely contained in the region.
Otherwise, the command applies to all lines starting after point.
When calling this function from Lisp, you can pretend that it was
called interactively by passing a non-nil INTERACTIVE argument.</p>
<p>
This function starts looking for the next match from the end of
the previous match.  Hence, it ignores matches that overlap
a previously found match.<a name="emacs-lisp-byte-code-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: emacs-lisp-byte-code-mode</h3>
Major mode for *.elc files.</p>
<p>
In addition to any hooks its parent mode `emacs-lisp-mode' might have run,
this mode runs the hook `emacs-lisp-byte-code-mode-hook', as the final step
during initialization.</p>

<a name="table-insert-column"></a>
<h3>Function: table-insert-column</h3>
Insert N table column(s).
When point is in a table the newly inserted column(s) are placed left
of the current column.  When point is outside of the table it must be
right side of the table within the table height range, then the newly
created column(s) are appended at the right of the table.</p>
<p>
(fn N)<a name="pr-ps-mode-using-ghostscript"></a>
<h3>Function: pr-ps-mode-using-ghostscript</h3>
Print major mode using PostScript through ghostscript.</p>

(fn N-UP &optional FILENAME)<a name="appt-add"></a>
<h3>Function: appt-add</h3>
Add an appointment for today at TIME with message MSG.
The time should be in either 24 hour format or am/pm format.
Optional argument WARNTIME is an integer (or string) giving the number
of minutes before the appointment at which to start warning.
The default is `appt-message-warning-time'.</p>
<p>
(fn TIME MSG &optional WARNTIME)<a name="window-min-size"></a>
<h3>Function: window-min-size</h3>
Return the minimum size of WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.
Optional argument HORIZONTAL non-nil means return the minimum
number of columns of WINDOW; otherwise return the minimum number
of WINDOW's lines.</p>
<p>
Optional argument IGNORE, if non-nil, means ignore restrictions
imposed by fixed size windows, `window-min-height' or
`window-min-width' settings.  If IGNORE equals `safe', live
windows may get as small as `window-safe-min-height' lines and
`window-safe-min-width' columns.  If IGNORE is a window, ignore
restrictions for that window only.  Any other non-nil value
means ignore all of the above restrictions for all windows.<a name="type-of"></a>
<h3>Function: type-of</h3>
Return a symbol representing the type of OBJECT.
The symbol returned names the object's basic type;
for example, (type-of 1) returns `integer'.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT)<a name="widget-princ-to-string"></a>
<h3>Function: widget-princ-to-string</h3>
Return string representation of OBJECT, any Lisp object.
No quoting characters are used; no delimiters are printed around
the contents of strings.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT)<a name="mm-multibyte-char-to-unibyte"></a>
<h3>Function: mm-multibyte-char-to-unibyte</h3>
Convert the multibyte character CH to a byte.
If the multibyte character does not represent a byte, return -1.</p>

<h3>Function: kmacro-call-ring-2nd-repeat</h3>
Execute second keyboard macro in macro ring.
This is like `kmacro-call-ring-2nd', but allows repeating macro commands
without repeating the prefix.<a name="shadow-initialize"></a>
<h3>Function: shadow-initialize</h3>
Set up file shadowing.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="run-python"></a>
<h3>Function: run-python</h3>
Run an inferior Python process.
Input and output via buffer named after
`python-shell-buffer-name'.  If there is a process already
running in that buffer, just switch to it.</p>
<p>
With argument, allows you to define CMD so you can edit the
command used to call the interpreter and define DEDICATED, so a
dedicated process for the current buffer is open.  When numeric
prefix arg is other than 0 or 4 do not SHOW.</p>
<p>
Runs the hook `inferior-python-mode-hook' (after the
`comint-mode-hook' is run).  (Type C-h m in the
process buffer for a list of commands.)</p>
<p>
(fn CMD &optional DEDICATED SHOW)<a name="set-window-dedicated-p"></a>
<h3>Function: set-window-dedicated-p</h3>
Mark WINDOW as dedicated according to FLAG.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.  FLAG
non-nil means mark WINDOW as dedicated to its buffer.  FLAG nil means
mark WINDOW as non-dedicated.  Return FLAG.</p>
<p>
When a window is dedicated to its buffer, `display-buffer' will refrain
from displaying another buffer in it.  `get-lru-window' and
`get-largest-window' treat dedicated windows specially.
`delete-windows-on', `replace-buffer-in-windows', `quit-window',
`quit-restore-window' and `kill-buffer' can delete a dedicated window
and the containing frame.</p>
<p>
As a special case, if FLAG is t, mark WINDOW as "strongly" dedicated to
its buffer.  Functions like `set-window-buffer' may change the buffer
displayed by a window, unless that window is strongly dedicated to its
buffer.  If and when `set-window-buffer' displays another buffer in a
window, it also makes sure that the window is no more dedicated.</p>

(fn FROM TO)<a name="ispell-complete-word-interior-frag"></a>
<h3>Function: ispell-complete-word-interior-frag</h3>
Completes word matching character sequence inside a word.<a name="ert-run-tests-batch"></a>
<h3>Function: ert-run-tests-batch</h3>
Run the tests specified by SELECTOR, printing results to the terminal.</p>
<p>
SELECTOR works as described in `ert-select-tests', except if
SELECTOR is nil, in which case all tests rather than none will be
run; this makes the command line "emacs -batch -l my-tests.el -f
ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit" useful.</p>
<p>
Returns the stats object.<a name="comint-run"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-run</h3>
Run PROGRAM in a Comint buffer and switch to it.
The buffer name is made by surrounding the file name of PROGRAM with `*'s.
The file name is used to make a symbol name, such as `comint-sh-hook', and any
hooks on this symbol are run in the buffer.
See `make-comint' and `comint-exec'.</p>
<p>
(fn PROGRAM)<a name="vendor-specific-keysyms"></a>
<h3>Function: vendor-specific-keysyms</h3>

<h3>Function: custom-group-save</h3>
Save all modified group members.<a name="dash--match-cons-1"></a>
<h3>Function: dash--match-cons-1</h3>
Match MATCH-FORM against SOURCE.</p>
<p>
MATCH-FORM is a proper or improper list.  Each element of
MATCH-FORM is either a symbol, which gets bound to the respective
value in source or another match form which gets destructured
recursively.</p>
<p>
If the cdr of last cons cell in the list is `nil', matching stops
there.</p>
<p>
SOURCE is a proper or improper list.</p>
<p>
(fn MATCH-FORM SOURCE &optional PROPS)<a name="debugger-make-xrefs"></a>
<h3>Function: debugger-make-xrefs</h3>
Attach cross-references to function names in the `*Backtrace*' buffer.<a name="tooltip-delay"></a>
<h3>Function: tooltip-delay</h3>
Return the delay in seconds for the next tooltip.<a name="generic-mode-internal"></a>
<h3>Function: generic-mode-internal</h3>
Go into the generic mode MODE.</p>
<p>
(fn MODE COMMENT-LIST KEYWORD-LIST FONT-LOCK-LIST FUNCTION-LIST)<a name="browse-url-text-emacs"></a>
<h3>Function: browse-url-text-emacs</h3>
Ask a text browser to load URL.
URL defaults to the URL around or before point.
This runs the text browser specified by `browse-url-text-browser'.
With a prefix argument, it runs a new browser process in a new buffer.</p>
<p>
When called interactively, if variable `browse-url-new-window-flag' is
non-nil, load the document in a new browser process in a new term window,
otherwise use any existing one.  A non-nil interactive prefix argument
reverses the effect of `browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
When called non-interactively, optional second argument NEW-WINDOW is
used instead of `browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
(fn URL &optional NEW-BUFFER)<a name="use-fancy-splash-screens-p"></a>
<h3>Function: use-fancy-splash-screens-p</h3>
Return t if fancy splash screens should be used.</p>

<h3>Function: find-alternate-file-other-window</h3>
Find file FILENAME as a replacement for the file in the next window.
This command does not select that window.</p>
<p>
See C-x C-f for the possible forms of the FILENAME argument.</p>
<p>
Interactively, or if WILDCARDS is non-nil in a call from Lisp,
expand wildcards (if any) and replace the file with multiple files.<a name="byte-compile-output-docform"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-compile-output-docform</h3>
Print a form with a doc string.  INFO is (prefix doc-index postfix).
If PREFACE and NAME are non-nil, print them too,
before INFO and the FORM but after the doc string itself.
If SPECINDEX is non-nil, it is the index in FORM
of the function bytecode string.  In that case,
we output that argument and the following argument
(the constants vector) together, for lazy loading.
QUOTED says that we have to put a quote before the
list that represents a doc string reference.
`defvaralias', `autoload' and `custom-declare-variable' need that.</p>

<h3>Function: setup-japanese-environment-internal</h3></p>
<p>

(fn)<a name="capitalized-words-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: capitalized-words-mode</h3>
Toggle Capitalized Words mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Capitalized Words mode if ARG
is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,
enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Capitalized Words mode is a buffer-local minor mode.  When
enabled, a word boundary occurs immediately before an uppercase
letter in a symbol.  This is in addition to all the normal
boundaries given by the syntax and category tables.  There is no
restriction to ASCII.</p>
<p>
E.g. the beginning of words in the following identifier are as marked:</p>
<p>
  capitalizedWorDD
  ^          ^  ^^</p>
<p>
Note that these word boundaries only apply for word motion and
marking commands such as M-f.  This mode does not affect word
boundaries found by regexp matching (`\>', `\w' &c).</p>
<p>
This style of identifiers is common in environments like Java ones,
where underscores aren't trendy enough.  Capitalization rules are
sometimes part of the language, e.g. Haskell, which may thus encourage
such a style.  It is appropriate to add `capitalized-words-mode' to
the mode hook for programming language modes in which you encounter
variables like this, e.g. `java-mode-hook'.  It's unlikely to cause
trouble if such identifiers aren't used.</p>

If HORIZONTAL is omitted or nil, return the height of the text
area, like `window-body-height'.  Otherwise, return the width of
the text area, like `window-body-width'.<a name="-select-column"></a>
<h3>Function: -select-column</h3>
Select COLUMN from TABLE.</p>
<p>
TABLE is a list of lists where each element represents one row.
It is assumed each row has the same length.</p>

<h3>Function: wdired-change-to-wdired-mode</h3>
Put a Dired buffer in Writable Dired (WDired) mode.</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `wdired-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
In WDired mode, you can edit the names of the files in the
buffer, the target of the links, and the permission bits of the
files.  After typing M-x wdired-finish-edit, Emacs modifies the files and
directories to reflect your edits.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: url-https-file-exists-p</h3>
HTTPS wrapper around `file-exists-p' call.<a name="ps-print-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: ps-print-buffer</h3>
Generate and print a PostScript image of the buffer.</p>
<p>
Interactively, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the
user for a file name, and saves the PostScript image in that file instead of
sending it to the printer.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, the argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it is nil,
send the image to the printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save the PostScript
image in a file with that name.</p>
<p>

See `read-directory-name' for additional parameters.</p>
<p>
(fn PROMPT &optional DIR DEFAULT-DIRNAME MUSTMATCH INITIAL)<a name="erc-save-buffer-in-logs"></a>
<h3>Function: erc-save-buffer-in-logs</h3>
Append BUFFER contents to the log file, if logging is enabled.
If BUFFER is not provided, current buffer is used.
Logging is enabled if `erc-logging-enabled' returns non-nil.</p>
<p>
This is normally done on exit, to save the unsaved portion of the
buffer, since only the text that runs off the buffer limit is logged
automatically.</p>
<p>
You can save every individual message by putting this function on
`erc-insert-post-hook'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional BUFFER)<a name="window-atom-root"></a>
<h3>Function: window-atom-root</h3>
Return root of atomic window WINDOW is a part of.
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.
Return nil if WINDOW is not part of an atomic window.<a name="shell-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: shell-mode</h3>
Major mode for interacting with an inferior shell.
RET after the end of the process' output sends the text from
    the end of process to the end of the current line.
RET before end of process output copies the current line minus the prompt to
    the end of the buffer and sends it (C-c RET just copies the current line).
M-x send-invisible reads a line of text without echoing it, and sends it to
    the shell.  This is useful for entering passwords.  Or, add the function
    `comint-watch-for-password-prompt' to `comint-output-filter-functions'.</p>
<p>
If you want to make multiple shell buffers, rename the `*shell*' buffer
using M-x rename-buffer or M-x rename-uniquely and start a new shell.</p>
<p>
If you want to make shell buffers limited in length, add the function
`comint-truncate-buffer' to `comint-output-filter-functions'.</p>
<p>
If you accidentally suspend your process, use M-x comint-continue-subjob
to continue it.</p>
<p>
`cd', `pushd' and `popd' commands given to the shell are watched by Emacs to
keep this buffer's default directory the same as the shell's working directory.
While directory tracking is enabled, the shell's working directory is displayed
by C-x C-b or <C-down-mouse-1> in the `File' field.
M-x dirs queries the shell and resyncs Emacs's idea of what the current
    directory stack is.
M-x shell-dirtrack-mode turns directory tracking on and off.
(The `dirtrack' package provides an alternative implementation of this
feature - see the function `dirtrack-mode'.)</p>

Customization: Entry to this mode runs the hooks on `comint-mode-hook' and
`shell-mode-hook' (in that order).  Before each input, the hooks on
`comint-input-filter-functions' are run.  After each shell output, the hooks
on `comint-output-filter-functions' are run.</p>
<p>
Variables `shell-cd-regexp', `shell-chdrive-regexp', `shell-pushd-regexp'
and `shell-popd-regexp' are used to match their respective commands,
while `shell-pushd-tohome', `shell-pushd-dextract' and `shell-pushd-dunique'

we just skipped over some element and got to a beginning of line).</p>
<p>
The context is a list of tag-info structures.  The last one is the tag
immediately enclosing the current position.</p>

<h3>Function: bibtex-search-entry</h3>
Move point to the beginning of BibTeX entry named KEY.
Return position of entry if KEY is found or nil if not found.
With GLOBAL non-nil, search KEY in `bibtex-files'.  Otherwise the search
is limited to the current buffer.  Optional arg START is buffer position
where the search starts.  If it is nil, start search at beginning of buffer.
If DISPLAY is non-nil, display the buffer containing KEY.
Otherwise, use `set-buffer'.
When called interactively, START is nil, DISPLAY is t.
Also, GLOBAL is t if the current mode is not `bibtex-mode'
or `bibtex-search-entry-globally' is non-nil.
A prefix arg negates the value of `bibtex-search-entry-globally'.</p>
<p>
(fn KEY &optional GLOBAL START DISPLAY)<a name="x-create-frame-with-faces"></a>
<h3>Function: x-create-frame-with-faces</h3>

<h3>Function: expand-file-name</h3>
Convert filename NAME to absolute, and canonicalize it.
Second arg DEFAULT-DIRECTORY is directory to start with if NAME is relative
(does not start with slash or tilde); if DEFAULT-DIRECTORY is nil or missing,
the current buffer's value of `default-directory' is used.
NAME should be a string that is a valid file name for the underlying
filesystem.
File name components that are `.' are removed, and
so are file name components followed by `..', along with the `..' itself;
note that these simplifications are done without checking the resulting
file names in the file system.
Multiple consecutive slashes are collapsed into a single slash,
except at the beginning of the file name when they are significant (e.g.,
UNC file names on MS-Windows.)
An initial `~/' expands to your home directory.
An initial `~USER/' expands to USER's home directory.
See also the function `substitute-in-file-name'.</p>
<p>
For technical reasons, this function can return correct but
non-intuitive results for the root directory; for instance,
(expand-file-name ".." "/") returns "/..".  For this reason, use
(directory-file-name (file-name-directory dirname)) to traverse a
filesystem tree, not (expand-file-name ".."  dirname).</p>
<p>

Whether there is an owner for the given X selection.
SELECTION should be the name of the selection in question, typically
one of the symbols `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', `CLIPBOARD', or
`CLIPBOARD_MANAGER' (X expects these literal upper-case names.)  The
symbol nil is the same as `PRIMARY', and t is the same as `SECONDARY'.</p>
<p>
TERMINAL should be a terminal object or a frame specifying the X
server to query.  If omitted or nil, that stands for the selected
frame's display, or the first available X display.</p>

<h3>Function: apropos-print</h3>
Output result of apropos searching into buffer `*Apropos*'.
The value of `apropos-accumulator' is the list of items to output.
Each element should have the format
 (SYMBOL SCORE FN-DOC VAR-DOC [PLIST-DOC WIDGET-DOC FACE-DOC GROUP-DOC]).
The return value is the list that was in `apropos-accumulator', sorted
alphabetically by symbol name; but this function also sets
`apropos-accumulator' to nil before returning.</p>
<p>
If SPACING is non-nil, it should be a string; separate items with that string.
If non-nil TEXT is a string that will be printed as a heading.<a name="custom-variable-reset-backup"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-variable-reset-backup</h3>

<h3>Function: package-untar-buffer</h3>
Untar the current buffer.
This uses `tar-untar-buffer' from Tar mode.  All files should

<h3>Function: sql-oracle</h3>
Run sqlplus by Oracle as an inferior process.</p>
<p>
If buffer `*SQL*' exists but no process is running, make a new process.
If buffer exists and a process is running, just switch to buffer
`*SQL*'.</p>
<p>
Interpreter used comes from variable `sql-oracle-program'.  Login uses
the variables `sql-user', `sql-password', and `sql-database' as
defaults, if set.  Additional command line parameters can be stored in
the list `sql-oracle-options'.</p>
<p>
The buffer is put in SQL interactive mode, giving commands for sending
input.  See `sql-interactive-mode'.</p>
<p>
To set the buffer name directly, use C-u
before M-x sql-oracle.  Once session has started,
M-x sql-rename-buffer can be called separately to rename the
buffer.</p>
<p>
To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the input and output to the process, use C-x RET c
before M-x sql-oracle.  You can also specify this with C-x RET p
in the SQL buffer, after you start the process.
The default comes from `process-coding-system-alist' and
`default-process-coding-system'.</p>
<p>
(Type C-h m in the SQL buffer for a list of commands.)</p>
<p>
(fn &optional BUFFER)<a name="gnus-other-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-other-frame</h3>
Pop up a frame to read news.
This will call one of the Gnus commands which is specified by the user
option `gnus-other-frame-function' (default `gnus') with the argument
ARG if Gnus is not running, otherwise just pop up a Gnus frame.  The
optional second argument DISPLAY should be a standard display string
such as "unix:0" to specify where to pop up a frame.  If DISPLAY is
omitted or the function `make-frame-on-display' is not available, the
current display is used.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG DISPLAY)<a name="getenv"></a>
<h3>Function: getenv</h3>
Get the value of environment variable VARIABLE.
VARIABLE should be a string.  Value is nil if VARIABLE is undefined in
the environment.  Otherwise, value is a string.</p>
<p>
If optional parameter FRAME is non-nil, then it should be a
frame.  This function will look up VARIABLE in its 'environment
parameter.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, this function searches `process-environment' for
VARIABLE.  If it is not found there, then it continues the search
in the environment list of the selected frame.<a name="get-char-property-and-overlay"></a>
<h3>Function: get-char-property-and-overlay</h3>
Like `get-char-property', but with extra overlay information.
The value is a cons cell.  Its car is the return value of `get-char-property'
with the same arguments--that is, the value of POSITION's property
PROP in OBJECT.  Its cdr is the overlay in which the property was
found, or nil, if it was found as a text property or not found at all.</p>
<p>
OBJECT is optional and defaults to the current buffer.  OBJECT may be
a string, a buffer or a window.  For strings, the cdr of the return
value is always nil, since strings do not have overlays.  If OBJECT is
a window, then that window's buffer is used, but window-specific
overlays are considered only if they are associated with OBJECT.  If
POSITION is at the end of OBJECT, both car and cdr are nil.</p>
<p>
(fn POSITION PROP &optional OBJECT)<a name="-zip-fill"></a>
<h3>Function: -zip-fill</h3>
Zip LISTS, with FILL-VALUE padded onto the shorter lists. The
lengths of the returned groupings are equal to the length of the
longest input list.</p>
<p>
(fn FILL-VALUE &rest LISTS)<a name="diff-merge-strings"></a>
<h3>Function: diff-merge-strings</h3>
Merge the diff between ANCESTOR and FROM into TO.
Returns the merged string if successful or nil otherwise.
The strings are assumed not to contain any "\n" (i.e. end of line).
If ANCESTOR = FROM, returns TO.
If ANCESTOR = TO, returns FROM.
The heuristic is simplistic and only really works for cases
like (diff-merge-strings "b/foo" "b/bar" "/a/c/foo").</p>
<p>
(fn ANCESTOR FROM TO)<a name="Info-finder-find-file"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-finder-find-file</h3>
Finder-specific implementation of `Info-find-file'.<a name="kmacro-display-counter"></a>
<h3>Function: kmacro-display-counter</h3>
Display current counter value.<a name="execute-extended-command"></a>
<h3>Function: execute-extended-command</h3>
Read function name, then read its arguments and call it.</p>
<p>
To pass a numeric argument to the command you are invoking, specify
the numeric argument to this command.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, the argument PREFIXARG is the prefix argument to
give to the command you invoke, if it asks for an argument.<a name="custom-split-regexp-maybe"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-split-regexp-maybe</h3>
If REGEXP is a string, split it to a list at `\|'.
You can get the original back from the result with:
  (mapconcat 'identity result "\|")</p>
<p>
IF REGEXP is not a string, return it unchanged.<a name="flycheck-dedent-error-messages"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-dedent-error-messages</h3>
Dedent all messages of ERRORS.</p>
<p>
For each error in ERRORS, determine the indentation offset from
the leading whitespace of the first line, and dedent all further
lines accordingly.</p>
<p>
Return ERRORS, with in-place modifications.<a name="split-string"></a>
<h3>Function: split-string</h3>
Split STRING into substrings bounded by matches for SEPARATORS.</p>
<p>
The beginning and end of STRING, and each match for SEPARATORS, are
splitting points.  The substrings matching SEPARATORS are removed, and
the substrings between the splitting points are collected as a list,
which is returned.</p>
<p>
If SEPARATORS is non-nil, it should be a regular expression matching text
which separates, but is not part of, the substrings.  If nil it defaults to
`split-string-default-separators', normally "[ \f\t\n\r\v]+", and
OMIT-NULLS is forced to t.</p>
<p>
If OMIT-NULLS is t, zero-length substrings are omitted from the list (so
that for the default value of SEPARATORS leading and trailing whitespace
are effectively trimmed).  If nil, all zero-length substrings are retained,
which correctly parses CSV format, for example.</p>
<p>
Note that the effect of `(split-string STRING)' is the same as
`(split-string STRING split-string-default-separators t)'.  In the rare
case that you wish to retain zero-length substrings when splitting on
whitespace, use `(split-string STRING split-string-default-separators)'.</p>
<p>
Modifies the match data; use `save-match-data' if necessary.<a name="eval-region"></a>
<h3>Function: eval-region</h3>
Execute the region as Lisp code.
When called from programs, expects two arguments,
giving starting and ending indices in the current buffer
of the text to be executed.
Programs can pass third argument PRINTFLAG which controls output:
A value of nil means discard it; anything else is stream for printing it.
Also the fourth argument READ-FUNCTION, if non-nil, is used
instead of `read' to read each expression.  It gets one argument
which is the input stream for reading characters.</p>
<p>
This function does not move point.</p>
<p>

Insert TIMER into `timer-list'.
If TRIGGERED-P is t, make TIMER inactive (put it on the list, but
mark it as already triggered).  To remove it, use `cancel-timer'.</p>
<p>
REUSE-CELL, if non-nil, is a cons cell to reuse when inserting
TIMER into `timer-list' (usually a cell removed from that list by
`cancel-timer-internal'; using this reduces consing for repeat
timers).  If nil, allocate a new cell.<a name="mouse-appearance-menu"></a>

and presents suggestions for completion.</p>
<p>
With a prefix argument ARG, it searches all buffers accepted by the
function pointed out by `dabbrev-friend-buffer-function' to find the
completions.</p>
<p>
If the prefix argument is 16 (which comes from C-u C-u),
then it searches *all* buffers.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="forward-button"></a>
<h3>Function: forward-button</h3>
Move to the Nth next button, or Nth previous button if N is negative.
If N is 0, move to the start of any button at point.
If WRAP is non-nil, moving past either end of the buffer continues from the
other end.
If DISPLAY-MESSAGE is non-nil, the button's help-echo string is displayed.
Any button with a non-nil `skip' property is skipped over.
Returns the button found.<a name="x-display-color-p"></a>
<h3>Function: x-display-color-p</h3>
Return t if DISPLAY supports color.
The optional argument DISPLAY specifies which display to ask about.
DISPLAY should be either a frame or a display name (a string).
If omitted or nil, that stands for the selected frame's display.<a name="scroll-up-command"></a>
<h3>Function: scroll-up-command</h3>
Scroll text of selected window upward ARG lines; or near full screen if no ARG.
If `scroll-error-top-bottom' is non-nil and `scroll-up' cannot
scroll window further, move cursor to the bottom line.
When point is already on that position, then signal an error.
A near full screen is `next-screen-context-lines' less than a full screen.
Negative ARG means scroll downward.

While find runs asynchronously, you can use the C-x ` command
to find the text that grep hits refer to.</p>
<p>
This command uses a special history list for its arguments, so you can
easily repeat a find command.</p>
<p>
(fn COMMAND-ARGS)<a name="format-replace-strings"></a>
<h3>Function: format-replace-strings</h3>
Do multiple replacements on the buffer.
ALIST is a list of (FROM . TO) pairs, which should be proper arguments to
`search-forward' and `replace-match', respectively.
Optional second arg REVERSE, if non-nil, means the pairs are (TO . FROM),
so that you can use the same list in both directions if it contains only
literal strings.
Optional args BEG and END specify a region of the buffer on which to operate.<a name="byte-compile-nilconstp"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-compile-nilconstp</h3>

whose cons is send, send-item or recv and whose cdr is the string
being transferred.  This list may grow up to a size of
`gdb-debug-log-max' after which the oldest element (at the end of
the list) is deleted every time a new one is added (at the front).</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="c-guess-buffer-no-install"></a>
<h3>Function: c-guess-buffer-no-install</h3>
Guess the style on the whole current buffer; don't install it.</p>
<p>
If given a prefix argument (or if the optional argument ACCUMULATE is
non-nil) then the previous guess is extended, otherwise a new guess is
made from scratch.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ACCUMULATE)<a name="list-buffers"></a>
<h3>Function: list-buffers</h3>
Display a list of existing buffers.
The list is displayed in a buffer named "*Buffer List*".

but still contains full information about each coding system.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="match-substitute-replacement"></a>
<h3>Function: match-substitute-replacement</h3>
Return REPLACEMENT as it will be inserted by `replace-match'.
In other words, all back-references in the form `\&' and `\N'
are substituted with actual strings matched by the last search.
Optional FIXEDCASE, LITERAL, STRING and SUBEXP have the same
meaning as for `replace-match'.<a name="process-tty-name"></a>
<h3>Function: process-tty-name</h3>
Return the name of the terminal PROCESS uses, or nil if none.
This is the terminal that the process itself reads and writes on,
not the name of the pty that Emacs uses to talk with that terminal.</p>

<h3>Function: compilation-previous-file</h3>
Move point to the previous error for a different file than the current one.
Prefix arg N says how many files to move backwards (or forwards, if negative).<a name="indent-region"></a>
<h3>Function: indent-region</h3>
Indent each nonblank line in the region.
A numeric prefix argument specifies a column: indent each line to that column.</p>
<p>
With no prefix argument, the command chooses one of these methods and
indents all the lines with it:</p>
<p>
  1) If `fill-prefix' is non-nil, insert `fill-prefix' at the
     beginning of each line in the region that does not already begin
     with it.
  2) If `indent-region-function' is non-nil, call that function
     to indent the region.
  3) Indent each line via `indent-according-to-mode'.</p>
<p>
Called from a program, START and END specify the region to indent.
If the third argument COLUMN is an integer, it specifies the
column to indent to; if it is nil, use one of the three methods above.<a name="info-other-window"></a>
<h3>Function: info-other-window</h3>
Like `info' but show the Info buffer in another window.<a name="make-frame-visible"></a>
<h3>Function: make-frame-visible</h3>

DIRECTORY is the name of a directory, a string.
CLASS is the name of a project class, a symbol.
MTIME is either the modification time of the directory-local
variables file that defined this class, or nil.</p>
<p>
When a file beneath DIRECTORY is visited, the mode-specific
variables from CLASS are applied to the buffer.  The variables
for a class are defined using `dir-locals-set-class-variables'.<a name="flycheck-select-checker"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-select-checker</h3>
Select CHECKER for the current buffer.</p>
<p>
CHECKER is a syntax checker symbol (see `flycheck-checkers') or
nil.  In the former case, use CHECKER for the current buffer,
otherwise deselect the current syntax checker (if any) and use
automatic checker selection via `flycheck-checkers'.</p>
<p>
If called interactively prompt for CHECKER.  With prefix arg
deselect the current syntax checker and enable automatic
selection again.</p>
<p>
Set `flycheck-checker' to CHECKER and automatically start a new
syntax check if the syntax checker changed.</p>
<p>
CHECKER will be used, even if it is not contained in
`flycheck-checkers', or if it is disabled via
`flycheck-disabled-checkers'.<a name="make-ert-test-quit"></a>

<p>
(fn)<a name="file-cache-add-directory-recursively"></a>
<h3>Function: file-cache-add-directory-recursively</h3>
Adds DIR and any subdirectories to the file-cache.
This function does not use any external programs.
If the optional REGEXP argument is non-nil, only files which match it
will be added to the cache.  Note that the REGEXP is applied to the
files in each directory, not to the directory list itself.</p>
<p>
(fn DIR &optional REGEXP)<a name="erc-determine-network"></a>
<h3>Function: erc-determine-network</h3>
Return the name of the network or "Unknown" as a symbol.  Use the
server parameter NETWORK if provided, otherwise parse the server name and

<p>
(fn CHAR)<a name="read-directory-name"></a>
<h3>Function: read-directory-name</h3>
Read directory name, prompting with PROMPT and completing in directory DIR.
Value is not expanded---you must call `expand-file-name' yourself.
Default name to DEFAULT-DIRNAME if user exits with the same
non-empty string that was inserted by this function.
 (If DEFAULT-DIRNAME is omitted, DIR combined with INITIAL is used,
  or just DIR if INITIAL is nil.)
If the user exits with an empty minibuffer, this function returns
an empty string.  (This can only happen if the user erased the
pre-inserted contents or if `insert-default-directory' is nil.)
Fourth arg MUSTMATCH non-nil means require existing directory's name.
 Non-nil and non-t means also require confirmation after completion.
Fifth arg INITIAL specifies text to start with.
DIR should be an absolute directory name.  It defaults to
the value of `default-directory'.<a name="unrecord-window-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: unrecord-window-buffer</h3>
Unrecord BUFFER in WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.
BUFFER must be a live buffer and defaults to the buffer of
WINDOW.<a name="ert--make-stats"></a>

Value is FACE.<a name="backward-list"></a>
<h3>Function: backward-list</h3>
Move backward across one balanced group of parentheses.
With ARG, do it that many times.
Negative arg -N means move forward across N groups of parentheses.
This command assumes point is not in a string or comment.<a name="kill-all-local-variables"></a>
<h3>Function: kill-all-local-variables</h3>
Switch to Fundamental mode by killing current buffer's local variables.
Most local variable bindings are eliminated so that the default values
become effective once more.  Also, the syntax table is set from
`standard-syntax-table', the local keymap is set to nil,
and the abbrev table from `fundamental-mode-abbrev-table'.
This function also forces redisplay of the mode line.</p>
<p>
Every function to select a new major mode starts by
calling this function.</p>
<p>
As a special exception, local variables whose names have
a non-nil `permanent-local' property are not eliminated by this function.</p>
<p>
The first thing this function does is run
the normal hook `change-major-mode-hook'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="ispell-internal-change-dictionary"></a>
<h3>Function: ispell-internal-change-dictionary</h3>

When called interactively, the current buffer is assumed to be a
single .el file that follows the packaging guidelines; see info
node `(elisp)Packaging'.</p>
<p>
When called from Lisp, PKG-INFO is a vector describing the
information, of the type returned by `package-buffer-info'; and
TYPE is the package type (either `single' or `tar').<a name="ediff-files"></a>
<h3>Function: ediff-files</h3>
Run Ediff on a pair of files, FILE-A and FILE-B.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE-A FILE-B &optional STARTUP-HOOKS)<a name="last-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: last-buffer</h3>
Return the last buffer in FRAME's buffer list.
If BUFFER is the last buffer, return the preceding buffer
instead.  Buffers not visible in windows are preferred to visible
buffers, unless optional argument VISIBLE-OK is non-nil.
Optional third argument FRAME nil or omitted means use the
selected frame's buffer list.  If no such buffer exists, return
the buffer `*scratch*', creating it if necessary.<a name="format-network-address"></a>
<h3>Function: format-network-address</h3>
Convert network ADDRESS from internal format to a string.
A 4 or 5 element vector represents an IPv4 address (with port number).
An 8 or 9 element vector represents an IPv6 address (with port number).
If optional second argument OMIT-PORT is non-nil, don't include a port
number in the string, even when present in ADDRESS.
Returns nil if format of ADDRESS is invalid.</p>
<p>
(fn ADDRESS &optional OMIT-PORT)<a name="char-table-subtype"></a>
<h3>Function: char-table-subtype</h3>
Return the subtype of char-table CHAR-TABLE.  The value is a symbol.</p>
<p>
(fn CHAR-TABLE)<a name="custom-group-action"></a>

See `auth-source-search' for details on SPEC.</p>
<p>
(fn &rest SPEC &key BACKEND REQUIRE CREATE DELETE TYPE MAX HOST USER PORT &allow-other-keys)<a name="comint-insert-input"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-insert-input</h3>
In a Comint buffer, set the current input to the previous input at point.
If there is no previous input at point, run the command specified
by the global keymap (usually `mouse-yank-at-click').</p>
<p>
(fn EVENT)<a name="play-sound-file"></a>
<h3>Function: play-sound-file</h3>
Play sound stored in FILE.
VOLUME and DEVICE correspond to the keywords of the sound
specification for `play-sound'.<a name="pcomplete/bzip2"></a>
<h3>Function: pcomplete/bzip2</h3>
Completion for `bzip2'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="beginning-of-defun"></a>
<h3>Function: beginning-of-defun</h3>
Move backward to the beginning of a defun.
With ARG, do it that many times.  Negative ARG means move forward
to the ARGth following beginning of defun.</p>
<p>
If search is successful, return t; point ends up at the beginning
of the line where the search succeeded.  Otherwise, return nil.</p>
<p>
When `open-paren-in-column-0-is-defun-start' is non-nil, a defun
is assumed to start where there is a char with open-parenthesis
syntax at the beginning of a line.  If `defun-prompt-regexp' is
non-nil, then a string which matches that regexp may also precede
the open-parenthesis.  If `defun-prompt-regexp' and
`open-paren-in-column-0-is-defun-start' are both nil, this
function instead finds an open-paren at the outermost level.</p>
<p>
If the variable `beginning-of-defun-function' is non-nil, its
value is called as a function, with argument ARG, to find the
defun's beginning.</p>
<p>
Regardless of the values of `defun-prompt-regexp' and
`beginning-of-defun-function', point always moves to the
beginning of the line whenever the search is successful.<a name="widget-editable-list-value-get"></a>

(fn FILES)<a name="describe-language-environment"></a>
<h3>Function: describe-language-environment</h3>
Describe how Emacs supports language environment LANGUAGE-NAME.<a name="vc-dir"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-dir</h3>
Show the VC status for "interesting" files in and below DIR.
This allows you to mark files and perform VC operations on them.
The list omits files which are up to date, with no changes in your copy
or the repository, if there is nothing in particular to say about them.</p>
<p>
Preparing the list of file status takes time; when the buffer
first appears, it has only the first few lines of summary information.
The file lines appear later.</p>
<p>
Optional second argument BACKEND specifies the VC backend to use.
Interactively, a prefix argument means to ask for the backend.</p>
<p>
These are the commands available for use in the file status buffer:</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `vc-dir-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>

Copy sign of X2 to value of X1, and return the result.
Cause an error if X1 or X2 is not a float.</p>
<p>
(fn X1 X2)<a name="sgml-tag"></a>
<h3>Function: sgml-tag</h3>
Prompt for a tag and insert it, optionally with attributes.
Completion and configuration are done according to `sgml-tag-alist'.
If you like tags and attributes in uppercase do M-x set-variable
`skeleton-transformation-function' RET `upcase' RET, or put this
in your `.emacs':
  (setq sgml-transformation-function 'upcase)</p>
<p>
This is a skeleton command (see `skeleton-insert').
Normally the skeleton text is inserted at point, with nothing "inside".
If there is a highlighted region, the skeleton text is wrapped
around the region text.</p>
<p>
A prefix argument ARG says to wrap the skeleton around the next ARG words.
A prefix argument of -1 says to wrap around region, even if not highlighted.
A prefix argument of zero says to wrap around zero words---that is, nothing.
This is a way of overriding the use of a highlighted region.<a name="rfc2047-encode-region"></a>
<h3>Function: rfc2047-encode-region</h3>
Encode words in region B to E that need encoding.
By default, the region is treated as containing RFC2822 addresses.
Dynamically bind `rfc2047-encoding-type' to change that.<a name="help-mode-menu"></a>
<h3>Function: help-mode-menu</h3>
Menu for Help Mode.<a name="shell-write-history-on-exit"></a>
<h3>Function: shell-write-history-on-exit</h3>
Called when the shell process is stopped.</p>
<p>
Writes the input history to a history file
`comint-input-ring-file-name' using `comint-write-input-ring'
and inserts a short message in the shell buffer.</p>
<p>
This function is a sentinel watching the shell interpreter process.
Sentinels will always get the two parameters PROCESS and EVENT.</p>
<p>
(fn PROCESS EVENT)<a name="eldoc-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: eldoc-mode</h3>
Toggle echo area display of Lisp objects at point (ElDoc mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable ElDoc mode if ARG is positive,
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable ElDoc mode
if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
ElDoc mode is a buffer-local minor mode.  When enabled, the echo
area displays information about a function or variable in the
text where point is.  If point is on a documented variable, it
displays the first line of that variable's doc string.  Otherwise
it displays the argument list of the function called in the
expression point is on.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="left-word"></a>
<h3>Function: left-word</h3>
Move point N words to the left (to the right if N is negative).</p>
<p>
Depending on the bidirectional context, this may move either backward
or forward in the buffer.  This is in contrast with M-b
and M-f, which see.</p>
<p>
Value is normally t.
If an edge of the buffer or a field boundary is reached, point is left there
there and the function returns nil.  Field boundaries are not noticed
if `inhibit-field-text-motion' is non-nil.<a name="rfc2047-encode"></a>
<h3>Function: rfc2047-encode</h3>
Encode the word(s) in the region B to E.

<h3>Function: make-comint-in-buffer</h3>
Make a Comint process NAME in BUFFER, running PROGRAM.
If BUFFER is nil, it defaults to NAME surrounded by `*'s.
If there is a running process in BUFFER, it is not restarted.</p>
<p>
PROGRAM should be one of the following:
- a string, denoting an executable program to create via
  `start-file-process'
- a cons pair of the form (HOST . SERVICE), denoting a TCP
  connection to be opened via `open-network-stream'
- nil, denoting a newly-allocated pty.</p>
<p>
Optional fourth arg STARTFILE is the name of a file, whose
contents are sent to the process as its initial input.</p>
<p>
If PROGRAM is a string, any more args are arguments to PROGRAM.</p>
<p>
Return the (possibly newly created) process buffer.</p>
<p>
(fn NAME BUFFER PROGRAM &optional STARTFILE &rest SWITCHES)<a name="clear-this-command-keys"></a>
<h3>Function: clear-this-command-keys</h3>
Clear out the vector that `this-command-keys' returns.
Also clear the record of the last 100 events, unless optional arg
KEEP-RECORD is non-nil.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional KEEP-RECORD)<a name="widget-apply-action"></a>
<h3>Function: widget-apply-action</h3>
Apply :action in WIDGET in response to EVENT.</p>
<p>
(fn WIDGET &optional EVENT)<a name="auth-source-backend-list-p"></a>
<h3>Function: auth-source-backend-list-p</h3>
Test OBJ to see if it a list of objects which are a child of type auth-source-backend<a name="diff-refine-hunk"></a>
<h3>Function: diff-refine-hunk</h3>
Highlight changes of hunk at point at a finer granularity.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="read-key-sequence"></a>
<h3>Function: read-key-sequence</h3>
Read a sequence of keystrokes and return as a string or vector.
The sequence is sufficient to specify a non-prefix command in the
current local and global maps.</p>
<p>
First arg PROMPT is a prompt string.  If nil, do not prompt specially.
Second (optional) arg CONTINUE-ECHO, if non-nil, means this key echos
as a continuation of the previous key.</p>
<p>
The third (optional) arg DONT-DOWNCASE-LAST, if non-nil, means do not
convert the last event to lower case.  (Normally any upper case event
is converted to lower case if the original event is undefined and the lower
case equivalent is defined.)  A non-nil value is appropriate for reading
a key sequence to be defined.</p>
<p>
A C-g typed while in this function is treated like any other character,
and `quit-flag' is not set.</p>
<p>
If the key sequence starts with a mouse click, then the sequence is read
using the keymaps of the buffer of the window clicked in, not the buffer
of the selected window as normal.</p>
<p>
`read-key-sequence' drops unbound button-down events, since you normally
only care about the click or drag events which follow them.  If a drag
or multi-click event is unbound, but the corresponding click event would
be bound, `read-key-sequence' turns the event into a click event at the
drag's starting position.  This means that you don't have to distinguish
between click and drag, double, or triple events unless you want to.</p>
<p>
`read-key-sequence' prefixes mouse events on mode lines, the vertical
lines separating windows, and scroll bars with imaginary keys
`mode-line', `vertical-line', and `vertical-scroll-bar'.</p>
<p>
Optional fourth argument CAN-RETURN-SWITCH-FRAME non-nil means that this
function will process a switch-frame event if the user switches frames
before typing anything.  If the user switches frames in the middle of a
key sequence, or at the start of the sequence but CAN-RETURN-SWITCH-FRAME
is nil, then the event will be put off until after the current key sequence.</p>
<p>
`read-key-sequence' checks `function-key-map' for function key
sequences, where they wouldn't conflict with ordinary bindings.  See
`function-key-map' for more details.</p>
<p>
The optional fifth argument CMD-LOOP, if non-nil, means
that this key sequence is being read by something that will
read commands one after another.  It should be nil if the caller
will read just one key sequence.</p>
<p>
(fn PROMPT &optional CONTINUE-ECHO DONT-DOWNCASE-LAST CAN-RETURN-SWITCH-FRAME CMD-LOOP)<a name="widget-value-convert-widget"></a>
<h3>Function: widget-value-convert-widget</h3>
Initialize :value from :args in WIDGET.</p>
<p>
(fn WIDGET)<a name="indent-sexp"></a>
<h3>Function: indent-sexp</h3>
Indent each line of the list starting just after point.
If optional arg ENDPOS is given, indent each line, stopping when
ENDPOS is encountered.<a name="open-dribble-file"></a>
<h3>Function: open-dribble-file</h3>
Start writing all keyboard characters to a dribble file called FILE.
If FILE is nil, close any open dribble file.
The file will be closed when Emacs exits.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE)<a name="ietf-drums-quote-string"></a>
<h3>Function: ietf-drums-quote-string</h3>
Quote string if it needs quoting to be displayed in a header.<a name="smerge-start-session"></a>
<h3>Function: smerge-start-session</h3>
Turn on `smerge-mode' and move point to first conflict marker.
If no conflict maker is found, turn off `smerge-mode'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="decode-hz-region"></a>
<h3>Function: decode-hz-region</h3>
Decode HZ/ZW encoded text in the current region.
Return the length of resulting text.</p>
<p>
(fn BEG END)<a name="window-inside-pixel-edges"></a>
<h3>Function: window-inside-pixel-edges</h3>
Return a list of the edge pixel coordinates of WINDOW's text area.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
The returned list has the form (LEFT TOP RIGHT BOTTOM), all relative to
(0,0) at the top left corner of the frame's window area.</p>
<p>
RIGHT is one more than the rightmost x position of WINDOW's text area.
BOTTOM is one more than the bottommost y position of WINDOW's text area.
The inside edges do not include the space used by WINDOW's scroll bar,
display margins, fringes, header line, and/or mode line.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WINDOW)<a name="handle-shift-selection"></a>
<h3>Function: handle-shift-selection</h3>
Activate/deactivate mark depending on invocation thru shift translation.
This function is called by `call-interactively' when a command
with a `^' character in its `interactive' spec is invoked, before
running the command itself.</p>
<p>
If `shift-select-mode' is enabled and the command was invoked
through shift translation, set the mark and activate the region
temporarily, unless it was already set in this way.  See
`this-command-keys-shift-translated' for the meaning of shift
translation.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, if the region has been activated temporarily,
deactivate it, and restore the variable `transient-mark-mode' to
its earlier value.<a name="face-attribute-relative-p"></a>
<h3>Function: face-attribute-relative-p</h3>
Check whether a face attribute value is relative.
Specifically, this function returns t if the attribute ATTRIBUTE
with the value VALUE is relative.</p>
<p>
A relative value is one that doesn't entirely override whatever is
inherited from another face.  For most possible attributes,
the only relative value that users see is `unspecified'.
However, for :height, floating point values are also relative.</p>
<p>
(fn ATTRIBUTE VALUE)<a name="face-italic-p"></a>
<h3>Function: face-italic-p</h3>
Return non-nil if the font of FACE is italic on FRAME.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.
Use `face-attribute' for finer control.<a name="upcase-word"></a>
<h3>Function: upcase-word</h3>
Convert following word (or ARG words) to upper case, moving over.
With negative argument, convert previous words but do not move.
See also `capitalize-word'.</p>
<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="display-supports-face-attributes-p"></a>
<h3>Function: display-supports-face-attributes-p</h3>
Return non-nil if all the face attributes in ATTRIBUTES are supported.
The optional argument DISPLAY can be a display name, a frame, or
nil (meaning the selected frame's display).</p>
<p>
The definition of `supported' is somewhat heuristic, but basically means
that a face containing all the attributes in ATTRIBUTES, when merged
with the default face for display, can be represented in a way that's</p>
<p>
 (1) different in appearance than the default face, and
 (2) `close in spirit' to what the attributes specify, if not exact.</p>
<p>
Point (2) implies that a `:weight black' attribute will be satisfied by
any display that can display bold, and a `:foreground "yellow"' as long
as it can display a yellowish color, but `:slant italic' will _not_ be
satisfied by the tty display code's automatic substitution of a `dim'
face for italic.</p>
<p>
(fn ATTRIBUTES &optional DISPLAY)<a name="change-class"></a>
<h3>Function: change-class</h3>
Change the class of OBJ to type CLASS.
This may create or delete slots, but does not affect the return value
of `eq'.<a name="dired-advertised-find-file"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-advertised-find-file</h3>
In Dired, visit the file or directory named on this line.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="vc-git-print-log"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-git-print-log</h3>

Note that using SHORTLOG requires at least Git version 1.5.6,
for the --graph option.</p>
<p>
(fn FILES BUFFER &optional SHORTLOG START-REVISION LIMIT)<a name="lisp-interaction-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: lisp-interaction-mode</h3>
Major mode for typing and evaluating Lisp forms.
Like Lisp mode except that M-x eval-print-last-sexp evals the Lisp expression
before point, and prints its value into the buffer, advancing point.
Note that printing is controlled by `eval-expression-print-length'
and `eval-expression-print-level'.</p>
<p>
Commands:
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.
Paragraphs are separated only by blank lines.
Semicolons start comments.</p>

<p>

Entry to this mode calls the value of `lisp-interaction-mode-hook'
if that value is non-nil.<a name="indent-new-comment-line"></a>
<h3>Function: indent-new-comment-line</h3>
Break line at point and indent, continuing comment if within one.
This indents the body of the continued comment
under the previous comment line.</p>
<p>
This command is intended for styles where you write a comment per line,
starting a new comment (and terminating it if necessary) on each line.
If you want to continue one comment across several lines, use C-j.</p>
<p>
If a fill column is specified, it overrides the use of the comment column
or comment indentation.</p>
<p>
The inserted newline is marked hard if variable `use-hard-newlines' is true,
unless optional argument SOFT is non-nil.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional SOFT)<a name="ispell-begin-skip-region"></a>
<h3>Function: ispell-begin-skip-region</h3>

  o default value used as `file-name-coding-system' for converting file names
      if CODING-SYSTEM is ASCII-compatible
  o default value for the command `set-terminal-coding-system'
  o default value for the command `set-keyboard-coding-system'
      if CODING-SYSTEM is ASCII-compatible<a name="pcomplete/ssh"></a>
<h3>Function: pcomplete/ssh</h3>

<h3>Function: defined-colors</h3>
Return a list of colors supported for a particular frame.
The argument FRAME specifies which frame to try.
The value may be different for frames on different display types.
If FRAME doesn't support colors, the value is nil.
If FRAME is nil, that stands for the selected frame.<a name="wildcard-to-regexp"></a>
<h3>Function: wildcard-to-regexp</h3>
Given a shell file name pattern WILDCARD, return an equivalent regexp.
The generated regexp will match a filename only if the filename
matches that wildcard according to shell rules.  Only wildcards known
by `sh' are supported.<a name="compose-mail-other-window"></a>

<p>
(fn X)<a name="set-justification"></a>
<h3>Function: set-justification</h3>
Set the region's justification style to STYLE.
This commands prompts for the kind of justification to use.
If the mark is not active, this command operates on the current paragraph.
If the mark is active, it operates on the region.  However, if the
beginning and end of the region are not at paragraph breaks, they are
moved to the beginning and end (respectively) of the paragraphs they
are in.</p>
<p>
If variable `use-hard-newlines' is true, all hard newlines are
taken to be paragraph breaks.</p>
<p>

<p>
- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible
    and iconified frames.</p>
<p>
- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.</p>
<p>
Any other value of ALL-FRAMES means consider all windows on the
selected frame and no others.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional BUFFER-OR-NAME ALL-FRAMES)<a name="window-parent"></a>
<h3>Function: window-parent</h3>
Return the parent window of window WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.
Return nil for a window with no parent (e.g. a root window).</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WINDOW)<a name="make-ert-test-aborted-with-non-local-exit"></a>
<h3>Function: make-ert-test-aborted-with-non-local-exit</h3></p>
<p>

(fn &key MESSAGES SHOULD-FORMS)<a name="event-apply-modifier"></a>
<h3>Function: event-apply-modifier</h3>
Apply a modifier flag to event EVENT.
SYMBOL is the name of this modifier, as a symbol.
LSHIFTBY is the numeric value of this modifier, in keyboard events.
PREFIX is the string that represents this modifier in an event type symbol.<a name="zrgrep"></a>
<h3>Function: zrgrep</h3>
Recursively grep for REGEXP in gzipped FILES in tree rooted at DIR.
Like `rgrep' but uses `zgrep' for `grep-program', sets the default
file name to `*.gz', and sets `grep-highlight-matches' to `always'.</p>
<p>
(fn REGEXP &optional FILES DIR CONFIRM GREP-FIND-TEMPLATE)<a name="apropos-library"></a>
<h3>Function: apropos-library</h3>
List the variables and functions defined by library FILE.
FILE should be one of the libraries currently loaded and should
thus be found in `load-history'.  If `apropos-do-all' is non-nil,
the output includes key-bindings of commands.<a name="insert-directory"></a>
<h3>Function: insert-directory</h3>
Insert directory listing for FILE, formatted according to SWITCHES.
Leaves point after the inserted text.
SWITCHES may be a string of options, or a list of strings.
Optional third arg WILDCARD means treat FILE as shell wildcard.
Optional fourth arg FULL-DIRECTORY-P means file is a directory and
switches do not contain `d', so that a full listing is expected.</p>
<p>
This version of the function comes from `ls-lisp.el'.
If the value of `ls-lisp-use-insert-directory-program' is non-nil then
it works exactly like the version from `files.el' and runs a directory
listing program whose name is in the variable
`insert-directory-program'; if also WILDCARD is non-nil then it runs
the shell specified by `shell-file-name'.  If the value of
`ls-lisp-use-insert-directory-program' is nil then it runs a Lisp
emulation.</p>
<p>
The Lisp emulation does not run any external programs or shells.  It
supports ordinary shell wildcards if `ls-lisp-support-shell-wildcards'
is non-nil; otherwise, it interprets wildcards as regular expressions
to match file names.  It does not support all `ls' switches -- those
that work are: A a B C c F G g h i n R r S s t U u X.  The l switch
is assumed to be always present and cannot be turned off.<a name="scroll-up-line"></a>
<h3>Function: scroll-up-line</h3>
Scroll text of selected window upward ARG lines; or one line if no ARG.
If ARG is omitted or nil, scroll upward by one line.
This is different from `scroll-up-command' that scrolls a full screen.<a name="cdr-safe"></a>
<h3>Function: cdr-safe</h3>
Return the cdr of OBJECT if it is a cons cell, or else nil.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT)<a name="create-fontset-from-fontset-spec"></a>
<h3>Function: create-fontset-from-fontset-spec</h3>
Create a fontset from fontset specification string FONTSET-SPEC.
FONTSET-SPEC is a string of the format:
	FONTSET-NAME,SCRIPT-NAME0:FONT-NAME0,SCRIPT-NAME1:FONT-NAME1, ...
Any number of SPACE, TAB, and NEWLINE can be put before and after commas.</p>
<p>
When a frame uses the fontset as the `font' parameter, the frame's
default font name is derived from FONTSET-NAME by substituting
"iso8859-1" for the tail part "fontset-XXX".  But, if SCRIPT-NAMEn
is "ascii", use the corresponding FONT-NAMEn as the default font
name.</p>
<p>
Optional 2nd and 3rd arguments exist just for backward compatibility,
and are ignored.</p>
<p>
It returns a name of the created fontset.</p>
<p>
For backward compatibility, SCRIPT-NAME may be a charset name, in
which case, the corresponding script is decided by the variable
`charset-script-alist' (which see).<a name="align-newline-and-indent"></a>
<h3>Function: align-newline-and-indent</h3>
A replacement function for `newline-and-indent', aligning as it goes.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="scroll-down-command"></a>
<h3>Function: scroll-down-command</h3>
Scroll text of selected window down ARG lines; or near full screen if no ARG.
If `scroll-error-top-bottom' is non-nil and `scroll-down' cannot
scroll window further, move cursor to the top line.
When point is already on that position, then signal an error.
A near full screen is `next-screen-context-lines' less than a full screen.
Negative ARG means scroll upward.
If ARG is the atom `-', scroll upward by nearly full screen.<a name="equal-including-properties"></a>
<h3>Function: equal-including-properties</h3>
Return t if two Lisp objects have similar structure and contents.
This is like `equal' except that it compares the text properties
of strings.  (`equal' ignores text properties.)</p>
<p>
(fn O1 O2)<a name="terpri"></a>
<h3>Function: terpri</h3>
Output a newline to stream PRINTCHARFUN.
If PRINTCHARFUN is omitted or nil, the value of `standard-output' is used.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional PRINTCHARFUN)<a name="encode-hz-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: encode-hz-buffer</h3>
Encode the text in the current buffer to HZ.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="widget-default-button-face-get"></a>
<h3>Function: widget-default-button-face-get</h3></p>
<p>

(fn WIDGET)<a name="flycheck-define-error-level"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-define-error-level</h3>
Define a new error LEVEL with PROPERTIES.</p>
<p>
The following PROPERTIES constitute an error level:</p>
<p>
`:severity SEVERITY'
     A number denoting the severity of this level.  The higher
     the number, the more severe is this level compared to other
     levels.  Defaults to 0.</p>
<p>
     The severity is used by `flycheck-error-level-<' to
     determine the ordering of errors according to their levels.</p>
<p>
`:compilation-level LEVEL'</p>
<p>
     A number indicating the broad class of messages that errors
     at this level belong to: one of 0 (info), 1 (warning), or
     2 or nil (error).  Defaults to nil.</p>
<p>
     This is used by `flycheck-checker-pattern-to-error-regexp'
     to map error levels into `compilation-mode''s hierarchy and
     to get proper highlighting of errors in `compilation-mode'.</p>
<p>
`:overlay-category CATEGORY'
     A symbol denoting the overlay category to use for error
     highlight overlays for this level.  See Info
     node `(elisp)Overlay Properties' for more information about
     overlay categories.</p>
<p>
     A category for an error level overlay should at least define
     the `face' property, for error highlighting.  Another useful
     property for error level categories is `priority', to
     influence the stacking of multiple error level overlays.</p>
<p>
`:fringe-bitmap BITMAP'
     A fringe bitmap symbol denoting the bitmap to use for fringe
     indicators for this level.  See Info node `(elisp)Fringe
     Bitmaps' for more information about fringe bitmaps,
     including a list of built-in fringe bitmaps.</p>

     level in the error list.  See `flycheck-list-errors'.<a name="backward-button"></a>
<h3>Function: backward-button</h3>
Move to the Nth previous button, or Nth next button if N is negative.
If N is 0, move to the start of any button at point.
If WRAP is non-nil, moving past either end of the buffer continues from the
other end.
If DISPLAY-MESSAGE is non-nil, the button's help-echo string is displayed.
Any button with a non-nil `skip' property is skipped over.
Returns the button found.<a name="get-unicode-property-internal"></a>
<h3>Function: get-unicode-property-internal</h3>

Return a new list with the first item matching PRED removed.</p>
<p>
Alias: `-reject-first'</p>
<p>
See also: `-remove', `-map-first'</p>
<p>
(fn PRED LIST)<a name="up-list"></a>
<h3>Function: up-list</h3>
Move forward out of one level of parentheses.
With ARG, do this that many times.
A negative argument means move backward but still to a less deep spot.
This command assumes point is not in a string or comment.<a name="exchange-dot-and-mark"></a>
<h3>Function: exchange-dot-and-mark</h3>
Put the mark where point is now, and point where the mark is now.
This command works even when the mark is not active,
and it reactivates the mark.</p>
<p>
If Transient Mark mode is on, a prefix ARG deactivates the mark
if it is active, and otherwise avoids reactivating it.  If
Transient Mark mode is off, a prefix ARG enables Transient Mark
mode temporarily.<a name="minibuffer-prompt-width"></a>
<h3>Function: minibuffer-prompt-width</h3>
Return the display width of the minibuffer prompt.
Return 0 if current buffer is not a minibuffer.<a name="prog-indent-sexp"></a>

<h3>Function: lm-copyright-mark</h3>
Return the buffer location of the `Copyright' line.<a name="slot-makeunbound"></a>
<h3>Function: slot-makeunbound</h3>
In OBJECT, make SLOT unbound.<a name="view-file-other-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: view-file-other-frame</h3>
View FILE in View mode in another frame.
When done, kill the buffer visiting FILE if unmodified and if it wasn't
visited before; also, maybe delete other frame and/or return to previous
buffer.</p>
<p>
Emacs commands editing the buffer contents are not available; instead,
a special set of commands (mostly letters and punctuation)
are defined for moving around in the buffer.
Space scrolls forward, Delete scrolls backward.
For a list of all View commands, type H or h while viewing.</p>
<p>
This command runs the normal hook `view-mode-hook'.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE)<a name="customize-browse"></a>
<h3>Function: customize-browse</h3>
Create a tree browser for the customize hierarchy.<a name="symbol-file"></a>
<h3>Function: symbol-file</h3>
Return the name of the file that defined SYMBOL.
The value is normally an absolute file name.  It can also be nil,
if the definition is not associated with any file.  If SYMBOL
specifies an autoloaded function, the value can be a relative
file name without extension.</p>
<p>
If TYPE is nil, then any kind of definition is acceptable.  If
TYPE is `defun', `defvar', or `defface', that specifies function
definition, variable definition, or face definition only.<a name="vertical-motion"></a>
<h3>Function: vertical-motion</h3>
Move point to start of the screen line LINES lines down.
If LINES is negative, this means moving up.</p>
<p>
This function is an ordinary cursor motion function
which calculates the new position based on how text would be displayed.
The new position may be the start of a line,
or just the start of a continuation line.
The function returns number of screen lines moved over;
that usually equals LINES, but may be closer to zero
if beginning or end of buffer was reached.</p>
<p>
The optional second argument WINDOW specifies the window to use for
parameters such as width, horizontal scrolling, and so on.
The default is to use the selected window's parameters.</p>
<p>
LINES can optionally take the form (COLS . LINES), in which case
the motion will not stop at the start of a screen line but on
its column COLS (if such exists on that line, that is).</p>
<p>
`vertical-motion' always uses the current buffer,
regardless of which buffer is displayed in WINDOW.
This is consistent with other cursor motion functions
and makes it possible to use `vertical-motion' in any buffer,
whether or not it is currently displayed in some window.</p>
<p>
(fn LINES &optional WINDOW)<a name="command-history"></a>
<h3>Function: command-history</h3>
Examine commands from `command-history' in a buffer.
The number of commands listed is controlled by `list-command-history-max'.
The command history is filtered by `list-command-history-filter' if non-nil.
Use 
Uses keymap `command-history-map', which is not currently defined.
M-x command-history-repeat to repeat the command on the current line.</p>
<p>
Otherwise much like Emacs-Lisp Mode except that there is no self-insertion
and digits provide prefix arguments.  Tab does not indent.</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `command-history-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

This command always recompiles the Command History listing
and runs the normal hook `command-history-hook'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="make-char-table"></a>
<h3>Function: make-char-table</h3>
Return a newly created char-table, with purpose PURPOSE.
Each element is initialized to INIT, which defaults to nil.</p>
<p>
PURPOSE should be a symbol.  If it has a `char-table-extra-slots'
property, the property's value should be an integer between 0 and 10
that specifies how many extra slots the char-table has.  Otherwise,
the char-table has no extra slot.</p>
<p>
(fn PURPOSE &optional INIT)<a name="diff-auto-refine-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: diff-auto-refine-mode</h3>

<p>
Diff Auto Refine mode is a buffer-local minor mode used with
`diff-mode'.  When enabled, Emacs automatically highlights
changes in detail as the user visits hunks.  When transitioning
from disabled to enabled, it tries to refine the current hunk, as
well.</p>

<h3>Function: delete-window</h3>
Delete WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.
Return nil.</p>
<p>
If the variable `ignore-window-parameters' is non-nil or the
`delete-window' parameter of WINDOW equals t, do not process any
parameters of WINDOW.  Otherwise, if the `delete-window'
parameter of WINDOW specifies a function, call that function with
WINDOW as its sole argument and return the value returned by that
function.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, if WINDOW is part of an atomic window, call
`delete-window' with the root of the atomic window as its
argument.  Signal an error if WINDOW is either the only window on
its frame, the last non-side window, or part of an atomic window
that is its frame's root window.<a name="ewoc--node-next"></a>

<h3>Function: org-mode</h3>
Outline-based notes management and organizer, alias
"Carsten's outline-mode for keeping track of everything."</p>
<p>
Org-mode develops organizational tasks around a NOTES file which
contains information about projects as plain text.  Org-mode is
implemented on top of outline-mode, which is ideal to keep the content
of large files well structured.  It supports ToDo items, deadlines and
time stamps, which magically appear in the diary listing of the Emacs
calendar.  Tables are easily created with a built-in table editor.
Plain text URL-like links connect to websites, emails (VM), Usenet
messages (Gnus), BBDB entries, and any files related to the project.
For printing and sharing of notes, an Org-mode file (or a part of it)
can be exported as a structured ASCII or HTML file.</p>

<h3>Function: lookup-image-map</h3>
Lookup in image map MAP coordinates X and Y.
An image map is an alist where each element has the format (AREA ID PLIST).
An AREA is specified as either a rectangle, a circle, or a polygon:
A rectangle is a cons (rect . ((x0 . y0) . (x1 . y1))) specifying the
pixel coordinates of the upper left and bottom right corners.
A circle is a cons (circle . ((x0 . y0) . r)) specifying the center
and the radius of the circle; r may be a float or integer.
A polygon is a cons (poly . [x0 y0 x1 y1 ...]) where each pair in the
vector describes one corner in the polygon.
Returns the alist element for the first matching AREA in MAP.</p>

<p>
(fn NAME &optional ERROR)<a name="read-file-name"></a>
<h3>Function: read-file-name</h3>
Read file name, prompting with PROMPT and completing in directory DIR.
Value is not expanded---you must call `expand-file-name' yourself.</p>
<p>
DIR is the directory to use for completing relative file names.
It should be an absolute directory name, or nil (which means the
current buffer's value of `default-directory').</p>
<p>
DEFAULT-FILENAME specifies the default file name to return if the
user exits the minibuffer with the same non-empty string inserted
by this function.  If DEFAULT-FILENAME is a string, that serves
as the default.  If DEFAULT-FILENAME is a list of strings, the
first string is the default.  If DEFAULT-FILENAME is omitted or
nil, then if INITIAL is non-nil, the default is DIR combined with
INITIAL; otherwise, if the current buffer is visiting a file,
that file serves as the default; otherwise, the default is simply
the string inserted into the minibuffer.</p>
<p>
If the user exits with an empty minibuffer, return an empty
string.  (This happens only if the user erases the pre-inserted
contents, or if `insert-default-directory' is nil.)</p>
<p>
Fourth arg MUSTMATCH can take the following values:
- nil means that the user can exit with any input.
- t means that the user is not allowed to exit unless
  the input is (or completes to) an existing file.
- `confirm' means that the user can exit with any input, but she needs
  to confirm her choice if the input is not an existing file.
- `confirm-after-completion' means that the user can exit with any
  input, but she needs to confirm her choice if she called
  `minibuffer-complete' right before `minibuffer-complete-and-exit'
  and the input is not an existing file.
- anything else behaves like t except that typing RET does not exit if it
  does non-null completion.</p>
<p>
Fifth arg INITIAL specifies text to start with.</p>
<p>
Sixth arg PREDICATE, if non-nil, should be a function of one
argument; then a file name is considered an acceptable completion
alternative only if PREDICATE returns non-nil with the file name
as its argument.</p>
<p>
If this command was invoked with the mouse, use a graphical file
dialog if `use-dialog-box' is non-nil, and the window system or X
toolkit in use provides a file dialog box, and DIR is not a
remote file.  For graphical file dialogs, any of the special values
of MUSTMATCH `confirm' and `confirm-after-completion' are
treated as equivalent to nil.  Some graphical file dialogs respect
a MUSTMATCH value of t, and some do not (or it only has a cosmetic
effect, and does not actually prevent the user from entering a
non-existent file).</p>

This function is called when the window system is shutting down.
If this function returns non-nil, the window system shutdown is canceled.</p>
<p>
When a session manager tells Emacs that the window system is shutting
down, this function is called.  It calls the functions in the hook
`emacs-save-session-functions'.  Functions are called with the current
buffer set to a temporary buffer.  Functions should use `insert' to insert
lisp code to save the session state.  The buffer is saved in a file in the
home directory of the user running Emacs.  The file is evaluated when
Emacs is restarted by the session manager.</p>
<p>
If any of the functions returns non-nil, no more functions are called
and this function returns non-nil.  This will inform the session manager
that it should abort the window system shutdown.<a name="set-face-attribute-from-resource"></a>

something to select a different frame, or until the next time
this function is called.  If you are using a window system, the
previously selected frame may be restored as the selected frame
when returning to the command loop, because it still may have
the window system's input focus.  On a text terminal, the next
redisplay will display FRAME.</p>

SECS may be an integer, a floating point number, or the internal
time format returned by, e.g., `current-idle-time'.
If Emacs is currently idle, and has been idle for N seconds (N < SECS),
then it will call FUNCTION in SECS - N seconds from now.  Using
SECS <= N is not recommended if this function is invoked from an idle
timer, because FUNCTION will then be called immediately.</p>
<p>
If REPEAT is non-nil, do the action each time Emacs has been idle for
exactly SECS seconds (that is, only once for each time Emacs becomes idle).</p>
<p>
This function returns a timer object which you can use in `cancel-timer'.<a name="x-uses-old-gtk-dialog"></a>

<p>
(fn PROC NICK LOGIN HOST TO QUERY)<a name="define-coding-system"></a>
<h3>Function: define-coding-system</h3>
Define NAME (a symbol) as a coding system with DOCSTRING and attributes.
The remaining arguments must come in pairs ATTRIBUTE VALUE.  ATTRIBUTE
may be any symbol.</p>
<p>
The following attributes have special meanings.  Those labeled as
"(required)" should not be omitted.</p>
<p>
`:mnemonic' (required)</p>
<p>
VALUE is a character to display on mode line for the coding system.</p>
<p>
`:coding-type' (required)</p>
<p>
VALUE must be one of `charset', `utf-8', `utf-16', `iso-2022',
`emacs-mule', `shift-jis', `ccl', `raw-text', `undecided'.</p>
<p>
`:eol-type'</p>
<p>
VALUE is the EOL (end-of-line) format of the coding system.  It must be
one of `unix', `dos', `mac'.  The symbol `unix' means Unix-like EOL
(i.e. single LF), `dos' means DOS-like EOL (i.e. sequence of CR LF),
and `mac' means Mac-like EOL (i.e. single CR).  If omitted, Emacs
detects the EOL format automatically when decoding.</p>
<p>
`:charset-list'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a list of charsets supported by the coding system.  On
encoding by the coding system, if a character belongs to multiple
charsets in the list, a charset that comes earlier in the list is
selected.  If `:coding-type' is `iso-2022', VALUE may be `iso-2022',
which indicates that the coding system supports all ISO-2022 based
charsets.  If `:coding-type' is `emacs-mule', VALUE may be
`emacs-mule', which indicates that the coding system supports all
charsets that have the `:emacs-mule-id' property.</p>
<p>
`:ascii-compatible-p'</p>
<p>
If VALUE is non-nil, the coding system decodes all 7-bit bytes into
the corresponding ASCII characters, and encodes all ASCII characters
back to the corresponding 7-bit bytes.  VALUE defaults to nil.</p>
<p>
`:decode-translation-table'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a translation table to use on decoding.</p>
<p>
`:encode-translation-table'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a translation table to use on encoding.</p>
<p>
`:post-read-conversion'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a function to call after some text is inserted and
decoded by the coding system itself and before any functions in
`after-insert-functions' are called.  This function is passed one
argument; the number of characters in the text to convert, with
point at the start of the text.  The function should leave point
the same, and return the new character count.</p>
<p>
`:pre-write-conversion'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a function to call after all functions in
`write-region-annotate-functions' and `buffer-file-format' are
called, and before the text is encoded by the coding system
itself.  This function should convert the whole text in the
current buffer.  For backward compatibility, this function is
passed two arguments which can be ignored.</p>
<p>
`:default-char'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a character.  On encoding, a character not supported by
the coding system is replaced with VALUE.</p>
<p>
`:for-unibyte'</p>
<p>
VALUE non-nil means that visiting a file with the coding system
results in a unibyte buffer.</p>
<p>
`:mime-charset'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a symbol whose name is that of a MIME charset converted
to lower case.</p>
<p>
`:mime-text-unsuitable'</p>
<p>
VALUE non-nil means the `:mime-charset' property names a charset which
is unsuitable for the top-level media type "text".</p>
<p>
`:flags'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a list of symbols that control the ISO-2022 converter.
Each must be a member of the list `coding-system-iso-2022-flags'
(which see).  This attribute has a meaning only when `:coding-type'
is `iso-2022'.</p>
<p>
`:designation'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a vector [G0-USAGE G1-USAGE G2-USAGE G3-USAGE].
GN-USAGE specifies the usage of graphic register GN as follows.</p>
<p>
If it is nil, no charset can be designated to GN.</p>
<p>
If it is a charset, the charset is initially designated to GN, and
never used by the other charsets.</p>
<p>
If it is a list, the elements must be charsets, nil, 94, or 96.  GN
can be used by all the listed charsets.  If the list contains 94, any
iso-2022 charset whose code-space ranges are 94 long can be designated
to GN.  If the list contains 96, any charsets whose whose ranges are
96 long can be designated to GN.  If the first element is a charset,
that charset is initially designated to GN.</p>
<p>
This attribute has a meaning only when `:coding-type' is `iso-2022'.</p>
<p>
`:bom'</p>
<p>
This attributes specifies whether the coding system uses a `byte order
mark'.  VALUE must be nil, t, or cons of coding systems whose
`:coding-type' is `utf-16' or `utf-8'.</p>
<p>
If the value is nil, on decoding, don't treat the first two-byte as
BOM, and on encoding, don't produce BOM bytes.</p>
<p>
If the value is t, on decoding, skip the first two-byte as BOM, and on
encoding, produce BOM bytes according to the value of `:endian'.</p>
<p>
If the value is cons, on decoding, check the first two-byte.  If they
are 0xFE 0xFF, use the car part coding system of the value.  If they
are 0xFF 0xFE, use the cdr part coding system of the value.
Otherwise, treat them as bytes for a normal character.  On encoding,
produce BOM bytes according to the value of `:endian'.</p>
<p>
This attribute has a meaning only when `:coding-type' is `utf-16' or
`utf-8'.</p>
<p>
`:endian'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be `big' or `little' specifying big-endian and
little-endian respectively.  The default value is `big'.</p>
<p>
This attribute has a meaning only when `:coding-type' is `utf-16'.</p>
<p>
`:ccl-decoder'</p>
<p>
VALUE is a symbol representing the registered CCL program used for
decoding.  This attribute has a meaning only when `:coding-type' is
`ccl'.</p>
<p>
`:ccl-encoder'</p>
<p>
VALUE is a symbol representing the registered CCL program used for
encoding.  This attribute has a meaning only when `:coding-type' is
`ccl'.<a name="byte-compile-fix-header"></a>

<h3>Function: set-locale-environment</h3>
Set up multilingual environment for using LOCALE-NAME.
This sets the language environment, the coding system priority,
the default input method and sometimes other things.</p>
<p>
LOCALE-NAME should be a string which is the name of a locale supported
by the system.  Often it is of the form xx_XX.CODE, where xx is a
language, XX is a country, and CODE specifies a character set and
coding system.  For example, the locale name "ja_JP.EUC" might name
a locale for Japanese in Japan using the `japanese-iso-8bit'
coding-system.  The name may also have a modifier suffix, e.g. `@euro'
or `@cyrillic'.</p>
<p>
If LOCALE-NAME is nil, its value is taken from the environment
variables LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and LANG (the first one that is set).</p>
<p>
The locale names supported by your system can typically be found in a
directory named `/usr/share/locale' or `/usr/lib/locale'.  LOCALE-NAME
will be translated according to the table specified by
`locale-translation-file-name'.</p>
<p>
If FRAME is non-nil, only set the keyboard coding system and the
terminal coding system for the terminal of that frame, and don't
touch session-global parameters like the language environment.</p>
<p>
See also `locale-charset-language-names', `locale-language-names',
`locale-preferred-coding-systems' and `locale-coding-system'.<a name="mailcap-parse-mailcaps"></a>
<h3>Function: mailcap-parse-mailcaps</h3>
Parse out all the mailcaps specified in a path string PATH.
Components of PATH are separated by the `path-separator' character
appropriate for this system.  If FORCE, re-parse even if already
parsed.  If PATH is omitted, use the value of environment variable
MAILCAPS if set; otherwise (on Unix) use the path from RFC 1524, plus
/usr/local/etc/mailcap.<a name="cl-macroexpand"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-macroexpand</h3>
Return result of expanding macros at top level of FORM.
If FORM is not a macro call, it is returned unchanged.
Otherwise, the macro is expanded and the expansion is considered
in place of FORM.  When a non-macro-call results, it is returned.</p>
<p>
The second optional arg ENVIRONMENT specifies an environment of macro
definitions to shadow the loaded ones for use in file byte-compilation.</p>
<p>
(fn FORM &optional ENVIRONMENT)<a name="info-xref-check-all"></a>
<h3>Function: info-xref-check-all</h3>
Check external references in all info documents in the info path.
`Info-directory-list' and `Info-additional-directory-list' are
the info paths.  See `info-xref-check' for how each file is
checked.</p>
<p>
The search for "all" info files is rather permissive, since
info files don't necessarily have a ".info" extension and in
particular the Emacs manuals normally don't.  If you have a
source code directory in `Info-directory-list' then a lot of
extraneous files might be read.  This will be time consuming but
should be harmless.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="make-temp-file"></a>
<h3>Function: make-temp-file</h3>
Create a temporary file.
The returned file name (created by appending some random characters at the end
of PREFIX, and expanding against `temporary-file-directory' if necessary),
is guaranteed to point to a newly created empty file.
You can then use `write-region' to write new data into the file.</p>
<p>
If DIR-FLAG is non-nil, create a new empty directory instead of a file.</p>
<p>
If SUFFIX is non-nil, add that at the end of the file name.<a name="frame-configuration-to-register"></a>
<h3>Function: frame-configuration-to-register</h3>
Store the window configuration of all frames in register REGISTER.
Use C-x r j to restore the configuration.
Argument is a character, naming the register.<a name="window-system"></a>
<h3>Function: window-system</h3>
The name of the window system that FRAME is displaying through.
The value is a symbol:
 nil for a termcap frame (a character-only terminal),
 'x' for an Emacs frame that is really an X window,
 'w32' for an Emacs frame that is a window on MS-Windows display,
 'ns' for an Emacs frame on a GNUstep or Macintosh Cocoa display,
 'pc' for a direct-write MS-DOS frame.</p>
<p>
FRAME defaults to the currently selected frame.</p>
<p>
Use of this function as a predicate is deprecated.  Instead,
use `display-graphic-p' or any of the other `display-*-p'
predicates which report frame's specific UI-related capabilities.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FRAME)<a name="set-char-table-extra-slot"></a>
<h3>Function: set-char-table-extra-slot</h3>
Set CHAR-TABLE's extra-slot number N to VALUE.</p>
<p>
(fn CHAR-TABLE N VALUE)<a name="flycheck-package--goto-header"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-package--goto-header</h3>
Cannot open doc string file "/home/lars/.emacs.d/elpa/flycheck-package-20160919.747/flycheck-package.elc"
<a name="url-path-and-query"></a>
<h3>Function: url-path-and-query</h3>
Return the path and query components of URLOBJ.
These two components are stored together in the FILENAME slot of
the object.  The return value of this function is (PATH . QUERY),
where each of PATH and QUERY are strings or nil.<a name="abbrev-edit-save-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: abbrev-edit-save-buffer</h3>
Save all user-level abbrev definitions in current buffer.
The saved abbrevs are written to the file specified by
`abbrev-file-name'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="doc-view-minor-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: doc-view-minor-mode</h3>
Toggle displaying buffer via Doc View (Doc View minor mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Doc View minor mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
See the command `doc-view-mode' for more information on this mode.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="tty-register-default-colors"></a>
<h3>Function: tty-register-default-colors</h3>
Register the default set of colors for a character terminal.<a name="window-hscroll"></a>
<h3>Function: window-hscroll</h3>
Return the number of columns by which WINDOW is scrolled from left margin.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WINDOW)<a name="line-beginning-position"></a>
<h3>Function: line-beginning-position</h3>
Return the character position of the first character on the current line.
With optional argument N, scan forward N - 1 lines first.
If the scan reaches the end of the buffer, return that position.</p>
<p>
This function ignores text display directionality; it returns the
position of the first character in logical order, i.e. the smallest
character position on the line.</p>
<p>
This function constrains the returned position to the current field
unless that position would be on a different line than the original,
unconstrained result.  If N is nil or 1, and a front-sticky field
starts at point, the scan stops as soon as it starts.  To ignore field
boundaries, bind `inhibit-field-text-motion' to t.</p>
<p>
This function does not move point.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional N)<a name="mapcar"></a>
<h3>Function: mapcar</h3>
Apply FUNCTION to each element of SEQUENCE, and make a list of the results.
The result is a list just as long as SEQUENCE.
SEQUENCE may be a list, a vector, a bool-vector, or a string.</p>
<p>
(fn FUNCTION SEQUENCE)<a name="diff-delete-empty-files"></a>
<h3>Function: diff-delete-empty-files</h3>
Arrange for empty diff files to be removed.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="table-split-cell"></a>

<a name="uce-reply-to-uce"></a>
<h3>Function: uce-reply-to-uce</h3>
Compose a reply to unsolicited commercial email (UCE).
Sets up a reply buffer addressed to: the sender, his postmaster,
his abuse@ address, and the postmaster of the mail relay used.
You might need to set `uce-mail-reader' before using this.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional IGNORED)<a name="quail-install-decode-map"></a>
<h3>Function: quail-install-decode-map</h3>
Install the Quail decode map DECODE-MAP in the current Quail package.</p>
<p>
Optional 2nd arg NAME, if non-nil, is a name of Quail package for
which to install MAP.</p>
<p>
The installed decode map can be referred by the function `quail-decode-map'.</p>
<p>
(fn DECODE-MAP &optional NAME)<a name="delete-trailing-whitespace"></a>
<h3>Function: delete-trailing-whitespace</h3>
Delete trailing whitespace between START and END.
If called interactively, START and END are the start/end of the
region if the mark is active, or of the buffer's accessible
portion if the mark is inactive.</p>
<p>
This command deletes whitespace characters after the last
non-whitespace character in each line between START and END.  It
does not consider formfeed characters to be whitespace.</p>
<p>
If this command acts on the entire buffer (i.e. if called
interactively with the mark inactive, or called from Lisp with
END nil), it also deletes all trailing lines at the end of the
buffer if the variable `delete-trailing-lines' is non-nil.<a name="some-window"></a>
<h3>Function: some-window</h3>
Return a live window satisfying PREDICATE.
More precisely, cycle through all windows calling the function
PREDICATE on each one of them with the window as its sole
argument.  Return the first window for which PREDICATE returns
non-nil.  Windows are scanned starting with the window following
the selected window.  If no window satisfies PREDICATE, return
DEFAULT.</p>
<p>
MINIBUF t means include the minibuffer window even if the
minibuffer is not active.  MINIBUF nil or omitted means include
the minibuffer window only if the minibuffer is active.  Any
other value means do not include the minibuffer window even if
the minibuffer is active.</p>
<p>
ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted means consider all windows on the selected
frame, plus the minibuffer window if specified by the MINIBUF
argument.  If the minibuffer counts, consider all windows on all
frames that share that minibuffer too.  The following non-nil
values of ALL-FRAMES have special meanings:</p>
<p>
- t means consider all windows on all existing frames.</p>
<p>
- `visible' means consider all windows on all visible frames on
  the current terminal.</p>
<p>
- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible
  and iconified frames on the current terminal.</p>
<p>
- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.</p>
<p>
Anything else means consider all windows on the selected frame
and no others.<a name="widget-choice-match-inline"></a>
<h3>Function: widget-choice-match-inline</h3></p>
<p>

(fn WIDGET VALS)<a name="dired-mark-pop-up"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-mark-pop-up</h3>
Return FUNCTION's result on ARGS after showing which files are marked.
Displays the file names in a window showing a buffer named
BUFFER-OR-NAME; the default name being " *Marked Files*".  The
window is not shown if there is just one file, `dired-no-confirm'
is t, or OP-SYMBOL is a member of the list in `dired-no-confirm'.</p>
<p>
By default, Dired shrinks the display buffer to fit the marked files.
To disable this, use the Customization interface to add a new rule
to `display-buffer-alist' where condition regexp is "^ \*Marked Files\*$",
action argument symbol is `window-height' and its value is nil.</p>
<p>
FILES is the list of marked files.  It can also be (t FILENAME)
in the case of one marked file, to distinguish that from using
just the current file.</p>
<p>
FUNCTION should not manipulate files, just read input (an
argument or confirmation).</p>
<p>
(fn BUFFER-OR-NAME OP-SYMBOL FILES FUNCTION &rest ARGS)<a name="global-whitespace-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: global-whitespace-mode</h3>
Toggle whitespace visualization globally (Global Whitespace mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Global Whitespace mode if ARG
is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,
enable it if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
See also `whitespace-style', `whitespace-newline' and
`whitespace-display-mappings'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="info-xref-check"></a>
<h3>Function: info-xref-check</h3>
Check external references in FILENAME, an info document.
Interactively from an `Info-mode' or `texinfo-mode' buffer the
current info file is the default.</p>
<p>
Results are shown in a `compilation-mode' buffer.  The format is
a bit rough, but there shouldn't be many problems normally.  The
file:line:column: is the info document, but of course normally
any correction should be made in the original .texi file.
Finding the right place in the .texi is a manual process.</p>
<p>
When a target info file doesn't exist there's obviously no way to
validate node references within it.  A message is given for
missing target files once per source document.  It could be
simply that you don't have the target installed, or it could be a
mistake in the reference.</p>
<p>
Indirect info files are understood, just pass the top-level
foo.info to `info-xref-check' and it traverses all sub-files.
Compressed info files are accepted too as usual for `Info-mode'.</p>
<p>
"makeinfo" checks references internal to an info document, but
not external references, which makes it rather easy for mistakes
to creep in or node name changes to go unnoticed.
`Info-validate' doesn't check external references either.</p>
<p>
(fn FILENAME)<a name="artist-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: artist-mode</h3>
Toggle Artist mode.
With argument ARG, turn Artist mode on if ARG is positive.
Artist lets you draw lines, squares, rectangles and poly-lines,
ellipses and circles with your mouse and/or keyboard.</p>

<p>
(fn &optional BUFFER)<a name="require"></a>
<h3>Function: require</h3>
If feature FEATURE is not loaded, load it from FILENAME.
If FEATURE is not a member of the list `features', then the feature
is not loaded; so load the file FILENAME.
If FILENAME is omitted, the printname of FEATURE is used as the file name,
and `load' will try to load this name appended with the suffix `.elc' or
`.el', in that order.  The name without appended suffix will not be used.
See `get-load-suffixes' for the complete list of suffixes.
If the optional third argument NOERROR is non-nil,
then return nil if the file is not found instead of signaling an error.
Normally the return value is FEATURE.
The normal messages at start and end of loading FILENAME are suppressed.</p>
<p>
(fn FEATURE &optional FILENAME NOERROR)<a name="comint-strip-ctrl-m"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-strip-ctrl-m</h3>
Strip trailing `^M' characters from the current output group.
This function could be on `comint-output-filter-functions' or bound to a key.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional STRING)<a name="image-animated-p"></a>
<h3>Function: image-animated-p</h3>
Return non-nil if IMAGE can be animated.
To be capable of being animated, an image must be of a type
listed in `image-animated-types', and contain more than one
sub-image, with a specified animation delay.  The actual return
value is a cons (NIMAGES . DELAY), where NIMAGES is the number
of sub-images in the animated image and DELAY is the delay in
seconds until the next sub-image should be displayed.<a name="pcomplete"></a>
<h3>Function: pcomplete</h3>
Support extensible programmable completion.
To use this function, just bind the TAB key to it, or add it to your
completion functions list (it should occur fairly early in the list).</p>
<p>
(fn &optional INTERACTIVELY)<a name="standard-display-8bit"></a>
<h3>Function: standard-display-8bit</h3>
Display characters representing raw bytes in the range L to H literally.</p>
<p>
On a terminal display, each character in the range is displayed
by sending the corresponding byte directly to the terminal.</p>
<p>
On a graphic display, each character in the range is displayed
using the default font by a glyph whose code is the corresponding
byte.</p>
<p>
Note that ASCII printable characters (SPC to TILDA) are displayed
in the default way after this call.<a name="describe-theme"></a>
<h3>Function: describe-theme</h3>
Display a description of the Custom theme THEME (a symbol).</p>
<p>
(fn THEME)<a name="set-process-filter"></a>
<h3>Function: set-process-filter</h3>
Give PROCESS the filter function FILTER; nil means no filter.
A value of t means stop accepting output from the process.</p>
<p>
When a process has a filter, its buffer is not used for output.
Instead, each time it does output, the entire string of output is
passed to the filter.</p>
<p>
The filter gets two arguments: the process and the string of output.
The string argument is normally a multibyte string, except:
- if the process' input coding system is no-conversion or raw-text,
  it is a unibyte string (the non-converted input), or else
- if `default-enable-multibyte-characters' is nil, it is a unibyte
  string (the result of converting the decoded input multibyte
  string to unibyte with `string-make-unibyte').</p>
<p>
(fn PROCESS FILTER)<a name="interactive-p"></a>
<h3>Function: interactive-p</h3>
Return t if the containing function was run directly by user input.
This means that the function was called with `call-interactively'
(which includes being called as the binding of a key)
and input is currently coming from the keyboard (not a keyboard macro),
and Emacs is not running in batch mode (`noninteractive' is nil).</p>
<p>
The only known proper use of `interactive-p' is in deciding whether to
display a helpful message, or how to display it.  If you're thinking
of using it for any other purpose, it is quite likely that you're
making a mistake.  Think: what do you want to do when the command is
called from a keyboard macro?</p>
<p>
To test whether your function was called with `call-interactively',
either (i) add an extra optional argument and give it an `interactive'
spec that specifies non-nil unconditionally (such as "p"); or (ii)
use `called-interactively-p'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="nlistp"></a>

Return t if OBJECT is not a list.  Lists include nil.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT)<a name="internal-lisp-face-p"></a>
<h3>Function: internal-lisp-face-p</h3>
Return non-nil if FACE names a face.
FACE should be a symbol or string.

created on a new frame).  WINDOW is the window used for or created
by the `display-buffer' routines.  BUFFER is the buffer that
shall be displayed.</p>
<p>
This function installs or updates the quit-restore parameter of
WINDOW.  The quit-restore parameter is a list of four elements:
The first element is one of the symbols 'window, 'frame, 'same or
'other.  The second element is either one of the symbols 'window
or 'frame or a list whose elements are the buffer previously
shown in the window, that buffer's window start and window point,

(fn SWITCHES &optional NO-REVERT)<a name="set-default-font"></a>
<h3>Function: set-default-font</h3>
Set the default font to FONT.
When called interactively, prompt for the name of a font, and use
that font on the selected frame.  When called from Lisp, FONT
should be a font name (a string), a font object, font entity, or
font spec.</p>
<p>

<p>
(fn DIRECTORY)<a name="dired-compare-directories"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-compare-directories</h3>
Mark files with different file attributes in two dired buffers.
Compare file attributes of files in the current directory
with file attributes in directory DIR2 using PREDICATE on pairs of files
with the same name.  Mark files for which PREDICATE returns non-nil.
Mark files with different names if PREDICATE is nil (or interactively
with empty input at the predicate prompt).</p>
<p>
PREDICATE is a Lisp expression that can refer to the following variables:</p>
<p>
    size1, size2   - file size in bytes
    mtime1, mtime2 - last modification time in seconds, as a float
    fa1, fa2       - list of file attributes
                     returned by function `file-attributes'</p>
<p>
    where 1 refers to attribute of file in the current dired buffer
    and 2 to attribute of file in second dired buffer.</p>
<p>
Examples of PREDICATE:</p>
<p>
    (> mtime1 mtime2) - mark newer files
    (not (= size1 size2)) - mark files with different sizes
    (not (string= (nth 8 fa1) (nth 8 fa2))) - mark files with different modes
    (not (and (= (nth 2 fa1) (nth 2 fa2))   - mark files with different UID
              (= (nth 3 fa1) (nth 3 fa2))))   and GID.<a name="dired-do-copy"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-do-copy</h3>
Copy all marked (or next ARG) files, or copy the current file.
When operating on just the current file, prompt for the new name.</p>
<p>
When operating on multiple or marked files, prompt for a target
directory, and make the new copies in that directory, with the
same names as the original files.  The initial suggestion for the
target directory is the Dired buffer's current directory (or, if
`dired-dwim-target' is non-nil, the current directory of a
neighboring Dired window).</p>
<p>
If `dired-copy-preserve-time' is non-nil, this command preserves
the modification time of each old file in the copy, similar to
the "-p" option for the "cp" shell command.</p>
<p>
This command copies symbolic links by creating new ones, similar
to the "-d" option for the "cp" shell command.<a name="delete-non-matching-lines"></a>
<h3>Function: delete-non-matching-lines</h3>
Delete all lines except those containing matches for REGEXP.
A match split across lines preserves all the lines it lies in.
When called from Lisp (and usually interactively as well, see below)
applies to all lines starting after point.</p>
<p>
If REGEXP contains upper case characters (excluding those preceded by `\')
and `search-upper-case' is non-nil, the matching is case-sensitive.</p>
<p>
Second and third arg RSTART and REND specify the region to operate on.
This command operates on (the accessible part of) all lines whose
accessible part is entirely contained in the region determined by RSTART
and REND.  (A newline ending a line counts as part of that line.)</p>
<p>
Interactively, in Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, operate
on all lines whose accessible part is entirely contained in the region.
Otherwise, the command applies to all lines starting after point.
When calling this function from Lisp, you can pretend that it was
called interactively by passing a non-nil INTERACTIVE argument.</p>
<p>
This function starts looking for the next match from the end of
the previous match.  Hence, it ignores matches that overlap
a previously found match.<a name="invisible-p"></a>
<h3>Function: invisible-p</h3>
Non-nil if the property makes the text invisible.
POS-OR-PROP can be a marker or number, in which case it is taken to be
a position in the current buffer and the value of the `invisible' property
is checked; or it can be some other value, which is then presumed to be the
value of the `invisible' property of the text of interest.
The non-nil value returned can be t for truly invisible text or something
else if the text is replaced by an ellipsis.</p>
<p>
(fn POS-OR-PROP)<a name="window--resize-root-window"></a>
<h3>Function: window--resize-root-window</h3>
Resize root window WINDOW vertically by DELTA lines.
HORIZONTAL non-nil means resize root window WINDOW horizontally
by DELTA columns.</p>
<p>
IGNORE non-nil means ignore any restrictions imposed by fixed
size windows, `window-min-height' or `window-min-width' settings.</p>
<p>
This function is only called by the frame resizing routines.  It
resizes windows proportionally and never deletes any windows.<a name="register-ccl-program"></a>
<h3>Function: register-ccl-program</h3>
Register CCL program CCL-PROG as NAME in `ccl-program-table'.
CCL-PROG should be a compiled CCL program (vector), or nil.
If it is nil, just reserve NAME as a CCL program name.

<p>
If FILTER is t, interactively prompt the user for a regular
expression, and filter out entries that don't match it.</p>
<p>
If FILTER is a string, use this string as a regular expression
for filtering entries out.</p>
<p>
If FILTER is a function, filter out entries against which
calling the function returns nil.  This function takes one
argument: an entry from `org-agenda-get-day-entries'.</p>
<p>
FILTER can also be an alist with the car of each cell being
either 'headline or 'category.  For example:</p>
<p>
  '((headline "IMPORTANT")
    (category "Work"))</p>
<p>
will only add headlines containing IMPORTANT or headlines
belonging to the "Work" category.</p>
<p>
ARGS are symbols indicating what kind of entries to consider.
By default `org-agenda-to-appt' will use :deadline, :scheduled
and :timestamp entries.  See the docstring of `org-diary' for
details and examples.</p>
<p>
If an entry has a APPT_WARNTIME property, its value will be used
to override `appt-message-warning-time'.</p>

(fn FORM)<a name="comint-dynamic-complete-filename"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-dynamic-complete-filename</h3>
Dynamically complete the filename at point.
Completes if after a filename.
This function is similar to `comint-replace-by-expanded-filename', except that
it won't change parts of the filename already entered in the buffer; it just
adds completion characters to the end of the filename.  A completions listing
may be shown in a separate buffer if completion is ambiguous.</p>
<p>
Completion is dependent on the value of `comint-completion-addsuffix',
`comint-completion-recexact' and `comint-completion-fignore', and the timing of
completions listing is dependent on the value of `comint-completion-autolist'.</p>

<p>
(fn FILENAME DIRECTORY)<a name="Buffer-menu-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: Buffer-menu-mode</h3>
Major mode for Buffer Menu buffers.
The Buffer Menu is invoked by the commands C-x C-b,
M-x buffer-menu, and M-x buffer-menu-other-window.
See `buffer-menu' for a description of its contents.</p>
<p>
In Buffer Menu mode, the following commands are defined:</p>
<p>
q    Remove the Buffer Menu from the display.
RET  Select current line's buffer in place of the buffer menu.
o    Select that buffer in another window,
     so the Buffer Menu remains visible in its window.
V    Select current line's buffer, in View mode.
M-x Buffer-menu-view-other-window  Select that buffer in
     another window, in view-mode.
C-o  Make another window display that buffer.
m    Mark current line's buffer to be displayed.
v    Select current line's buffer.
     Also show buffers marked with m, in other windows.
1    Select that buffer in full-frame window.
2    Select that buffer in one window, together with the
     buffer selected before this one in another window.
M-s a C-s    Incremental search in the marked buffers.
M-s a C-M-s  Isearch for regexp in the marked buffers.
t    visit-tags-table this buffer.
~    Clear modified-flag on that buffer.
s    Mark that buffer to be saved, and move down.
C-k  Mark that buffer to be deleted, and move down.
C-d  Mark that buffer to be deleted, and move up.
x    Delete or save marked buffers.
u    Remove all marks from current line.
     With prefix argument, also move up one line.
DEL  Back up a line and remove marks.
%    Toggle read-only status of buffer on this line.
g    Update the list of buffers.
T    Toggle whether the menu displays only file buffers.
b    Bury the buffer listed on this line.</p>
<p>
In addition to any hooks its parent mode `tabulated-list-mode' might have run,
this mode runs the hook `Buffer-menu-mode-hook', as the final step
during initialization.<a name="copy-region-as-kill"></a>
<h3>Function: copy-region-as-kill</h3>
Save the region as if killed, but don't kill it.
In Transient Mark mode, deactivate the mark.
If `interprogram-cut-function' is non-nil, also save the text for a window
system cut and paste.</p>
<p>
This command's old key binding has been given to `kill-ring-save'.<a name="isearch-forward"></a>
<h3>Function: isearch-forward</h3>
Do incremental search forward.
With a prefix argument, do an incremental regular expression search instead.</p>
<p>
As you type characters, they add to the search string and are found.
The following non-printing keys are bound in `isearch-mode-map'.</p>
<p>
Type DEL to cancel last input item from end of search string.
Type RET to exit, leaving point at location found.
Type LFD (C-j) to match end of line.
Type C-s to search again forward, C-r to search again backward.
Type C-w to yank next word or character in buffer
  onto the end of the search string, and search for it.
Type C-M-w to delete character from end of search string.
Type C-M-y to yank char from buffer onto end of search string and search for it.
Type M-s C-e to yank rest of line onto end of search string and search for it.
Type C-y to yank the last string of killed text.
Type M-y to replace string just yanked into search prompt
 with string killed before it.
Type C-q to quote control character to search for it.
C-g while searching or when search has failed cancels input back to what has
 been found successfully.
C-g when search is successful aborts and moves point to starting point.</p>
<p>
If you try to exit with the search string still empty, it invokes
 nonincremental search.</p>
<p>
Type M-c to toggle search case-sensitivity.
Type M-r to toggle regular-expression mode.
Type M-s w to toggle word mode.
Type M-s _ to toggle symbol mode.</p>
<p>
Type M-s SPC to toggle whitespace matching.
In incremental searches, a space or spaces normally matches any whitespace
defined by the variable `search-whitespace-regexp'; see also the variables
`isearch-lax-whitespace' and `isearch-regexp-lax-whitespace'.</p>
<p>
Type M-e to edit the search string in the minibuffer.</p>
<p>
Also supported is a search ring of the previous 16 search strings.
Type M-n to search for the next item in the search ring.
Type M-p to search for the previous item in the search ring.
Type C-M-i to complete the search string using the search ring.</p>
<p>
Type M-% to run `query-replace' with string to replace from last search string.
Type C-M-% to run `query-replace-regexp' with the last search string.
Type M-s o to run `occur' that shows the last search string.
Type M-s h r to run `highlight-regexp' that highlights the last search string.</p>
<p>
Type C-h b to display all Isearch key bindings.
Type C-h k to display documentation of Isearch key.
Type C-h m to display documentation of Isearch mode.</p>
<p>
If an input method is turned on in the current buffer, that input
method is also active while you are typing characters to search.
To toggle the input method, type C-\.  It also toggles the input
method in the current buffer.</p>
<p>
To use a different input method for searching, type C-^,
and specify an input method you want to use.</p>
<p>
The above keys, bound in `isearch-mode-map', are often controlled by
 options; do M-x apropos on search-.* to find them.
Other control and meta characters terminate the search
 and are then executed normally (depending on `search-exit-option').
Likewise for function keys and mouse button events.</p>
<p>
If this function is called non-interactively, it does not return to
the calling function until the search is done.<a name="internal-temp-output-buffer-show"></a>

<p>
(fn)<a name="mail-complete"></a>
<h3>Function: mail-complete</h3>
Perform completion on header field or word preceding point.
Completable headers are according to `mail-complete-alist'.  If none matches
current header, calls `mail-complete-function' and passes prefix ARG if any.</p>
<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="feedmail-run-the-queue-global-prompt"></a>
<h3>Function: feedmail-run-the-queue-global-prompt</h3>
Like `feedmail-run-the-queue', but with a global confirmation prompt.
This is generally most useful if run non-interactively, since you can
bail out with an appropriate answer to the global confirmation prompt.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="list-processes"></a>
<h3>Function: list-processes</h3>
Display a list of all processes.
If optional argument QUERY-ONLY is non-nil, only processes with
the query-on-exit flag set are listed.
Any process listed as exited or signaled is actually eliminated
after the listing is made.
Optional argument BUFFER specifies a buffer to use, instead of
"*Process List*".
The return value is always nil.<a name="generate-new-buffer-name"></a>
<h3>Function: generate-new-buffer-name</h3>
Return a string that is the name of no existing buffer based on NAME.
If there is no live buffer named NAME, then return NAME.
Otherwise modify name by appending `<NUMBER>', incrementing NUMBER
(starting at 2) until an unused name is found, and then return that name.
Optional second argument IGNORE specifies a name that is okay to use (if
it is in the sequence to be tried) even if a buffer with that name exists.</p>
<p>
If NAME begins with a space (i.e., a buffer that is not normally
visible to users), then if buffer NAME already exists a random number
is first appended to NAME, to speed up finding a non-existent buffer.</p>
<p>
(fn NAME &optional IGNORE)<a name="round"></a>
<h3>Function: round</h3>
Return the nearest integer to ARG.
With optional DIVISOR, return the nearest integer to ARG/DIVISOR.</p>
<p>
Rounding a value equidistant between two integers may choose the
integer closer to zero, or it may prefer an even integer, depending on
your machine.  For example, (round 2.5) can return 3 on some
systems, but 2 on others.</p>
<p>
(fn ARG &optional DIVISOR)<a name="dash--match"></a>
<h3>Function: dash--match</h3>
Match MATCH-FORM against SOURCE.</p>
<p>
This function tests the MATCH-FORM and dispatches to specific
matchers based on the type of the expression.</p>
<p>
Key-value stores are disambiguated by placing a token &plist,
&alist or &hash as a first item in the MATCH-FORM.</p>
<p>
(fn MATCH-FORM SOURCE)<a name="tar-file-name-handler"></a>

Moves relative to `comint-input-ring-index'.</p>
<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="derived-mode-class"></a>
<h3>Function: derived-mode-class</h3>
Find the class of a major MODE.
A mode's class is the first ancestor which is NOT a derived mode.
Use the `derived-mode-parent' property of the symbol to trace backwards.
Since major-modes might all derive from `fundamental-mode', this function
is not very useful.<a name="cwarn-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: cwarn-mode</h3>
Minor mode that highlights suspicious C and C++ constructions.</p>
<p>
Suspicious constructs are highlighted using `font-lock-warning-face'.</p>
<p>
Note, in addition to enabling this minor mode, the major mode must
be included in the variable `cwarn-configuration'.  By default C and
C++ modes are included.</p>
<p>
With a prefix argument ARG, enable the mode if ARG is positive,
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode
if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="flycheck-assert-error-list-p"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-assert-error-list-p</h3>
Assert that all items in ERRORS are of `flycheck-error' type.</p>

<h3>Function: previous-char-property-change</h3>
Return the position of previous text property or overlay change.
Scans characters backward in the current buffer from POSITION till it
finds a change in some text property, or the beginning or end of an
overlay, and returns the position of that.
If none is found since (point-min), the function returns (point-min).</p>
<p>
If the optional second argument LIMIT is non-nil, don't search
past position LIMIT; return LIMIT if nothing is found before LIMIT.
LIMIT is a no-op if it is less than (point-min).</p>
<p>
(fn POSITION &optional LIMIT)<a name="set-process-buffer"></a>

<h3>Function: dired-flag-file-deletion</h3>
In Dired, flag the current line's file for deletion.
If the region is active, flag all files in the region.
Otherwise, with a prefix arg, flag files on the next ARG lines.</p>
<p>
If on a subdir headerline, flag all its files except `.' and `..'.
If the region is active in Transient Mark mode, flag all files
in the active region.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: transpose-paragraphs</h3>
Interchange the current paragraph with the next one.
With prefix argument ARG a non-zero integer, moves the current
paragraph past ARG paragraphs, leaving point after the current paragraph.
If ARG is positive, moves the current paragraph forwards, if
ARG is negative moves it backwards.  If ARG is zero, exchanges
the current paragraph with the one containing the mark.<a name="completion-pcm-try-completion"></a>
<h3>Function: completion-pcm-try-completion</h3></p>
<p>

(fn STRING TABLE PRED POINT)<a name="bookmark-jump"></a>
<h3>Function: bookmark-jump</h3>
Jump to bookmark BOOKMARK (a point in some file).
You may have a problem using this function if the value of variable
`bookmark-alist' is nil.  If that happens, you need to load in some
bookmarks.  See help on function `bookmark-load' for more about
this.</p>
<p>
If the file pointed to by BOOKMARK no longer exists, you will be asked
if you wish to give the bookmark a new location, and `bookmark-jump'
will then jump to the new location, as well as recording it in place
of the old one in the permanent bookmark record.</p>
<p>
BOOKMARK is usually a bookmark name (a string).  It can also be a
bookmark record, but this is usually only done by programmatic callers.</p>
<p>
If DISPLAY-FUNC is non-nil, it is a function to invoke to display the
bookmark.  It defaults to `switch-to-buffer'.  A typical value for
DISPLAY-FUNC would be `switch-to-buffer-other-window'.</p>
<p>
(fn BOOKMARK &optional DISPLAY-FUNC)<a name="vc-revert"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-revert</h3>
Revert working copies of the selected fileset to their repository contents.
This asks for confirmation if the buffer contents are not identical
to the working revision (except for keyword expansion).</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="toggle-input-method"></a>
<h3>Function: toggle-input-method</h3>
Enable or disable multilingual text input method for the current buffer.
Only one input method can be enabled at any time in a given buffer.</p>
<p>
The normal action is to enable an input method if none was enabled,
and disable the current one otherwise.  Which input method to enable
can be determined in various ways--either the one most recently used,
or the one specified by `default-input-method', or as a last resort
by reading the name of an input method in the minibuffer.</p>
<p>
With a prefix argument ARG, read an input method name with the minibuffer
and enable that one.  The default is the most recent input method specified
(not including the currently active input method, if any).</p>
<p>
When called interactively, the optional argument INTERACTIVE is non-nil,
which marks the variable `default-input-method' as set for Custom buffers.<a name="transpose-regions"></a>
<h3>Function: transpose-regions</h3>
Transpose region STARTR1 to ENDR1 with STARTR2 to ENDR2.
The regions should not be overlapping, because the size of the buffer is
never changed in a transposition.</p>
<p>
Optional fifth arg LEAVE-MARKERS, if non-nil, means don't update
any markers that happen to be located in the regions.</p>
<p>
Transposing beyond buffer boundaries is an error.</p>
<p>
(fn STARTR1 ENDR1 STARTR2 ENDR2 &optional LEAVE-MARKERS)<a name="make-directory-internal"></a>
<h3>Function: make-directory-internal</h3>
Create a new directory named DIRECTORY.</p>

<h3>Function: json-alist-p</h3>
Non-null if and only if LIST is an alist.<a name="ert--proper-list-p"></a>
<h3>Function: ert--proper-list-p</h3>
Return non-nil if X is a proper list, nil otherwise.<a name="autoload-read-section-header"></a>
<h3>Function: autoload-read-section-header</h3>
Read a section header form.
Since continuation lines have been marked as comments,

screen.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional CONCISE)<a name="set-face-font"></a>
<h3>Function: set-face-font</h3>
Change font-related attributes of FACE to those of FONT (a string).
FRAME nil or not specified means change face on all frames.
This sets the attributes `:family', `:foundry', `:width',
`:height', `:weight', and `:slant'.  When called interactively,
prompt for the face and font.<a name="display-buffer-pop-up-window"></a>
<h3>Function: display-buffer-pop-up-window</h3>
Display BUFFER by popping up a new window.
The new window is created on the selected frame, or in
`last-nonminibuffer-frame' if no windows can be created there.
If successful, return the new window; otherwise return nil.</p>
<p>
If ALIST has a non-nil `inhibit-switch-frame' entry, then in the
event that the new window is created on another frame, avoid
raising the frame.<a name="previous-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: previous-frame</h3>
Return the previous frame in the frame list before FRAME.
It considers only frames on the same terminal as FRAME.
By default, skip minibuffer-only frames.
If omitted, FRAME defaults to the selected frame.
If optional argument MINIFRAME is nil, exclude minibuffer-only frames.
If MINIFRAME is a window, include only its own frame
and any frame now using that window as the minibuffer.
If MINIFRAME is `visible', include all visible frames.
If MINIFRAME is 0, include all visible and iconified frames.
Otherwise, include all frames.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FRAME MINIFRAME)<a name="-annotate"></a>

<h3>Function: eudc-display-mail</h3>
Display e-mail address and make it clickable.</p>
<p>
(fn MAIL)<a name="what-cursor-position"></a>
<h3>Function: what-cursor-position</h3>
Print info on cursor position (on screen and within buffer).
Also describe the character after point, and give its character code
in octal, decimal and hex.</p>
<p>
For a non-ASCII multibyte character, also give its encoding in the
buffer's selected coding system if the coding system encodes the
character safely.  If the character is encoded into one byte, that
code is shown in hex.  If the character is encoded into more than one
byte, just "..." is shown.</p>
<p>
In addition, with prefix argument, show details about that character
in *Help* buffer.  See also the command `describe-char'.<a name="info"></a>
<h3>Function: info</h3>
Enter Info, the documentation browser.
Optional argument FILE-OR-NODE specifies the file to examine;
the default is the top-level directory of Info.
Called from a program, FILE-OR-NODE may specify an Info node of the form
"(FILENAME)NODENAME".
Optional argument BUFFER specifies the Info buffer name;
the default buffer name is *info*.  If BUFFER exists,
just switch to BUFFER.  Otherwise, create a new buffer
with the top-level Info directory.</p>
<p>
In interactive use, a non-numeric prefix argument directs
this command to read a file name from the minibuffer.
A numeric prefix argument selects an Info buffer with the prefix number
appended to the Info buffer name.</p>
<p>
The search path for Info files is in the variable `Info-directory-list'.
The top-level Info directory is made by combining all the files named `dir'
in all the directories in that path.</p>
<p>
See a list of available Info commands in `Info-mode'.<a name="auto-save-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: auto-save-mode</h3>

<h3>Function: print-region</h3>
Paginate and print the region contents.</p>
<p>
The variable `lpr-headers-switches' controls how to paginate.
If it is nil (the default), we run the `pr' program (or whatever program
`lpr-page-header-program' specifies) to paginate.
`lpr-page-header-switches' specifies the switches for that program.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, the switches in `lpr-headers-switches' are used
in the print command itself; we expect them to request pagination.</p>
<p>
See the variables `lpr-switches' and `lpr-command'
for further customization of the printer command.</p>

BUFFER may be a buffer or a buffer name.
Arguments START and END are character positions specifying the substring.
They default to the values of (point-min) and (point-max) in BUFFER.
Before insertion, process text properties according to
`yank-handled-properties' and `yank-excluded-properties'.<a name="length"></a>
<h3>Function: length</h3>
Return the length of vector, list or string SEQUENCE.
A byte-code function object is also allowed.
If the string contains multibyte characters, this is not necessarily
the number of bytes in the string; it is the number of characters.
To get the number of bytes, use `string-bytes'.</p>
<p>

<p>
Keywords supported:  :test :test-not :key</p>
<p>
(fn ITEM LIST [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="skeleton-proxy-new"></a>
<h3>Function: skeleton-proxy-new</h3>
Insert SKELETON.
Prefix ARG allows wrapping around words or regions (see `skeleton-insert').
If no ARG was given, but the region is visible, ARG defaults to -1 depending
on `skeleton-autowrap'.  An ARG of  M-0  will prevent this just for once.
This command can also be an abbrev expansion (3rd and 4th columns in
M-x edit-abbrevs  buffer: ""  command-name).</p>
<p>
Optional second argument STR may also be a string which will be the value
of `str' whereas the skeleton's interactor is then ignored.</p>
<p>
(fn SKELETON &optional STR ARG)<a name="minibuffer-electric-default-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: minibuffer-electric-default-mode</h3>
Toggle Minibuffer Electric Default mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Minibuffer Electric Default
mode if ARG is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called
from Lisp, enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Minibuffer Electric Default mode is a global minor mode.  When
enabled, minibuffer prompts that show a default value only show
the default when it's applicable -- that is, when hitting RET
would yield the default value.  If the user modifies the input
such that hitting RET would enter a non-default value, the prompt
is modified to remove the default indication.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="window-absolute-pixel-edges"></a>
<h3>Function: window-absolute-pixel-edges</h3>
Return a list of the edge pixel coordinates of WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
The returned list has the form (LEFT TOP RIGHT BOTTOM), all relative to
0, 0 at the top left corner of the display.</p>
<p>
RIGHT is one more than the rightmost x position occupied by WINDOW.
BOTTOM is one more than the bottommost y position occupied by WINDOW.
The pixel edges include the space used by WINDOW's scroll bar, display
margins, fringes, header line, and/or mode line.  For the pixel edges
of just the text area, use `window-inside-absolute-pixel-edges'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WINDOW)<a name="sha1"></a>
<h3>Function: sha1</h3>
Return the SHA1 (Secure Hash Algorithm) of an OBJECT.
OBJECT is either a string or a buffer.  Optional arguments START and

<h3>Function: startup-echo-area-message</h3></p>
<p>

(fn)<a name="face-descriptive-attribute-name"></a>
<h3>Function: face-descriptive-attribute-name</h3>
Return a descriptive name for ATTRIBUTE.<a name="set-visited-file-name"></a>
<h3>Function: set-visited-file-name</h3>
Change name of file visited in current buffer to FILENAME.
This also renames the buffer to correspond to the new file.
The next time the buffer is saved it will go in the newly specified file.
FILENAME nil or an empty string means mark buffer as not visiting any file.
Remember to delete the initial contents of the minibuffer
if you wish to pass an empty string as the argument.</p>
<p>
The optional second argument NO-QUERY, if non-nil, inhibits asking for
confirmation in the case where another buffer is already visiting FILENAME.</p>
<p>
The optional third argument ALONG-WITH-FILE, if non-nil, means that
the old visited file has been renamed to the new name FILENAME.<a name="x-menu-bar-open-internal"></a>
<h3>Function: x-menu-bar-open-internal</h3>
Start key navigation of the menu bar in FRAME.
This initially opens the first menu bar item and you can then navigate with the
arrow keys, select a menu entry with the return key or cancel with the
escape key.  If FRAME has no menu bar this function does nothing.</p>
<p>
If FRAME is nil or not given, use the selected frame.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FRAME)<a name="flycheck-fill-and-expand-error-file-names"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-fill-and-expand-error-file-names</h3>
Fill and expand file names in ERRORS.</p>
<p>
Expand all file names of ERRORS against the CWD directory.
If the file name of an error is nil fill in the result of
function `buffer-file-name' in the current buffer.</p>
<p>
Return ERRORS, modified in-place.<a name="autoload-generate-file-autoloads"></a>
<h3>Function: autoload-generate-file-autoloads</h3>
Insert an autoload section for FILE in the appropriate buffer.
Autoloads are generated for defuns and defmacros in FILE
marked by `generate-autoload-cookie' (which see).
If FILE is being visited in a buffer, the contents of the buffer are used.
OUTBUF is the buffer in which the autoload statements should be inserted.
If OUTBUF is nil, it will be determined by `autoload-generated-file'.</p>
<p>
If provided, OUTFILE is expected to be the file name of OUTBUF.
If OUTFILE is non-nil and FILE specifies a `generated-autoload-file'
different from OUTFILE, then OUTBUF is ignored.</p>
<p>
Return non-nil if and only if FILE adds no autoloads to OUTFILE
(or OUTBUF if OUTFILE is nil).</p>
<p>
(fn FILE &optional OUTBUF OUTFILE)<a name="format-annotate-atomic-property-change"></a>
<h3>Function: format-annotate-atomic-property-change</h3>

<p>
(fn FRAME COLS ROWS)<a name="ewoc-filter"></a>
<h3>Function: ewoc-filter</h3>
Remove all elements in EWOC for which PREDICATE returns nil.
Note that the buffer for EWOC will be current-buffer when PREDICATE
is called.  PREDICATE must restore the current buffer before it returns
if it changes it.
The PREDICATE is called with the element as its first argument.  If any
ARGS are given they will be passed to the PREDICATE.</p>
<p>
(fn EWOC PREDICATE &rest ARGS)<a name="seq-concatenate"></a>
<h3>Function: seq-concatenate</h3>

TYPE must be one of following symbols: vector, string or list.</p>
<p>

(fn TYPE SEQUENCE...)<a name="lcm"></a>
<h3>Function: lcm</h3>
Return the least common multiple of the arguments.</p>
<p>
(fn &rest ARGS)<a name="delete-matching-lines"></a>
<h3>Function: delete-matching-lines</h3>
Delete lines containing matches for REGEXP.
When called from Lisp (and usually when called interactively as
well, see below), applies to the part of the buffer after point.
The line point is in is deleted if and only if it contains a
match for regexp starting after point.</p>
<p>
If REGEXP contains upper case characters (excluding those preceded by `\')
and `search-upper-case' is non-nil, the matching is case-sensitive.</p>
<p>
Second and third arg RSTART and REND specify the region to operate on.
Lines partially contained in this region are deleted if and only if
they contain a match entirely contained in it.</p>
<p>
Interactively, in Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, operate
on the contents of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the
end of (the accessible portion of) the buffer.  When calling this function
from Lisp, you can pretend that it was called interactively by passing
a non-nil INTERACTIVE argument.</p>
<p>
If a match is split across lines, all the lines it lies in are deleted.
They are deleted _before_ looking for the next match.  Hence, a match
starting on the same line at which another match ended is ignored.<a name="lisp-outline-level"></a>
<h3>Function: lisp-outline-level</h3>
Lisp mode `outline-level' function.<a name="reverse-region"></a>
<h3>Function: reverse-region</h3>
Reverse the order of lines in a region.
From a program takes two point or marker arguments, BEG and END.</p>
<p>
(fn BEG END)<a name="epa-sign-region"></a>
<h3>Function: epa-sign-region</h3>
Sign the current region between START and END by SIGNERS keys selected.</p>
<p>
Don't use this command in Lisp programs!
Since this function operates on regions, it does some tricks such
as coding-system detection and unibyte/multibyte conversion.  If
you are sure how the data should be treated, you should consider
using the string based counterpart `epg-sign-string', or the file
based counterpart `epg-sign-file' instead.</p>
<p>
For example:</p>
<p>
(let ((context (epg-make-context 'OpenPGP)))
  (epg-sign-string
    context
    (encode-coding-string (buffer-substring start end) 'utf-8)))</p>
<p>
(fn START END SIGNERS MODE)<a name="match-data"></a>
<h3>Function: match-data</h3>
Return a list containing all info on what the last search matched.
Element 2N is `(match-beginning N)'; element 2N + 1 is `(match-end N)'.
All the elements are markers or nil (nil if the Nth pair didn't match)
if the last match was on a buffer; integers or nil if a string was matched.
Use `set-match-data' to reinstate the data in this list.</p>
<p>
If INTEGERS (the optional first argument) is non-nil, always use
integers (rather than markers) to represent buffer positions.  In
this case, and if the last match was in a buffer, the buffer will get
stored as one additional element at the end of the list.</p>
<p>
If REUSE is a list, reuse it as part of the value.  If REUSE is long
enough to hold all the values, and if INTEGERS is non-nil, no consing
is done.</p>
<p>
If optional third arg RESEAT is non-nil, any previous markers on the
REUSE list will be modified to point to nowhere.</p>
<p>
Return value is undefined if the last search failed.</p>
<p>

Scans characters backward in the current buffer from POSITION till it
finds a change in some text property, or the beginning or end of an
overlay, and returns the position of that.
If none is found since (point-min), the function returns (point-min).</p>
<p>
If the optional second argument LIMIT is non-nil, don't search
past position LIMIT; return LIMIT if nothing is found before LIMIT.

<h3>Function: delete-directory</h3>
Delete the directory named DIRECTORY.  Does not follow symlinks.
If RECURSIVE is non-nil, all files in DIRECTORY are deleted as well.
TRASH non-nil means to trash the directory instead, provided
`delete-by-moving-to-trash' is non-nil.</p>

<h3>Function: sql-help</h3>
Show short help for the SQL modes.</p>
<p>
Use an entry function to open an interactive SQL buffer.  This buffer is
usually named `*SQL*'.  The name of the major mode is SQLi.</p>
<p>
Use the following commands to start a specific SQL interpreter:</p>
<p>
    \\FREE</p>
<p>
Other non-free SQL implementations are also supported:</p>
<p>
    \\NONFREE</p>
<p>
But we urge you to choose a free implementation instead of these.</p>
<p>
You can also use M-x sql-product-interactive to invoke the
interpreter for the current `sql-product'.</p>
<p>
Once you have the SQLi buffer, you can enter SQL statements in the
buffer.  The output generated is appended to the buffer and a new prompt
is generated.  See the In/Out menu in the SQLi buffer for some functions
that help you navigate through the buffer, the input history, etc.</p>
<p>
If you have a really complex SQL statement or if you are writing a
procedure, you can do this in a separate buffer.  Put the new buffer in
`sql-mode' by calling M-x sql-mode.  The name of this buffer can be
anything.  The name of the major mode is SQL.</p>
<p>
In this SQL buffer (SQL mode), you can send the region or the entire
buffer to the interactive SQL buffer (SQLi mode).  The results are
appended to the SQLi buffer without disturbing your SQL buffer.</p>

<h3>Function: tool-bar--image-expression</h3>
Return an expression that evaluates to an image spec for ICON.<a name="set-mark"></a>
<h3>Function: set-mark</h3>
Set this buffer's mark to POS.  Don't use this function!
That is to say, don't use this function unless you want
the user to see that the mark has moved, and you want the previous
mark position to be lost.</p>
<p>
Normally, when a new mark is set, the old one should go on the stack.
This is why most applications should use `push-mark', not `set-mark'.</p>
<p>
Novice Emacs Lisp programmers often try to use the mark for the wrong
purposes.  The mark saves a location for the user's convenience.
Most editing commands should not alter the mark.
To remember a location for internal use in the Lisp program,
store it in a Lisp variable.  Example:</p>
<p>
   (let ((beg (point))) (forward-line 1) (delete-region beg (point))).<a name="inversion-require-emacs"></a>

If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.</p>
<p>
If INHERIT is nil, only a stipple directly defined by FACE is
  considered, so the return value may be nil.
If INHERIT is t, and FACE doesn't define a stipple, then any stipple
  that FACE inherits through its `:inherit' attribute is considered as
  well; however the return value may still be nil.
If INHERIT is a face or a list of faces, then it is used to try to
  resolve an unspecified stipple.</p>
<p>
To ensure that a valid stipple or nil is always returned, use a value of
`default' for INHERIT; this will resolve any unspecified values by merging
with the `default' face (which is always completely specified).<a name="x-window-property"></a>
<h3>Function: x-window-property</h3>
Value is the value of window property PROP on FRAME.
If FRAME is nil or omitted, use the selected frame.</p>

Return the next parent class for CLASS.
If CLASS is a superclass, return variable `eieio-default-superclass'.
If CLASS is variable `eieio-default-superclass' then return nil.
This is different from function `class-parent' as class parent returns
nil for superclasses.  This function performs no type checking!<a name="caadr"></a>
<h3>Function: caadr</h3>
Return the `car' of the `car' of the `cdr' of X.</p>
<p>
(fn X)<a name="x-selection"></a>
<h3>Function: x-selection</h3>
Return the value of an X Windows selection.
The argument TYPE (default `PRIMARY') says which selection,
and the argument DATA-TYPE (default `STRING') says
how to convert the data.</p>
<p>
TYPE may be any symbol (but nil stands for `PRIMARY').  However,
only a few symbols are commonly used.  They conventionally have
all upper-case names.  The most often used ones, in addition to
`PRIMARY', are `SECONDARY' and `CLIPBOARD'.</p>
<p>
DATA-TYPE is usually `STRING', but can also be one of the symbols
in `selection-converter-alist', which see.<a name="pcomplete/which"></a>

<p>

(fn FUN &optional NAME)<a name="format-delq-cons"></a>
<h3>Function: format-delq-cons</h3>
Remove the given CONS from LIST by side effect and return the new LIST.
Since CONS could be the first element of LIST, write
`(setq foo (format-delq-cons element foo))' to be sure of changing
the value of `foo'.<a name="skip-chars-backward"></a>
<h3>Function: skip-chars-backward</h3>
Move point backward, stopping after a char not in STRING, or at pos LIM.

<p>
(fn STRING &optional LIM)<a name="flycheck-option-comma-separated-list"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-option-comma-separated-list</h3>
Convert VALUE into a list separated by SEPARATOR.</p>
<p>
SEPARATOR is a string to separate items in VALUE, defaulting to
",".  FILTER is an optional function, which takes a single
argument and returns either a string or nil.</p>
<p>
If VALUE is a list, apply FILTER to each item in VALUE, remove
all nil items, and return a single string of all remaining items
separated by SEPARATOR.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, apply FILTER to VALUE and return the result.
SEPARATOR is ignored in this case.<a name="flycheck-may-check-automatically"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-may-check-automatically</h3>
Determine whether the buffer may be checked under CONDITION.</p>
<p>

If CONDITION is non-nil, determine whether syntax may checked
automatically according to
`flycheck-check-syntax-automatically'.<a name="-tree-mapreduce-from"></a>
<h3>Function: -tree-mapreduce-from</h3>
Apply FN to each element of TREE, and make a list of the results.
If elements of TREE are lists themselves, apply FN recursively to
elements of these nested lists.</p>
<p>
Then reduce the resulting lists using FOLDER and initial value
INIT-VALUE. See `-reduce-r-from'.</p>
<p>
This is the same as calling `-tree-reduce-from' after `-tree-map'
but is twice as fast as it only traverse the structure once.</p>
<p>
(fn FN FOLDER INIT-VALUE TREE)<a name="-flatten"></a>
<h3>Function: -flatten</h3>
Take a nested list L and return its contents as a single, flat list.</p>
<p>
Note that because `nil' represents a list of zero elements (an
empty list), any mention of nil in L will disappear after
flattening.  If you need to preserve nils, consider `-flatten-n'
or map them to some unique symbol and then map them back.</p>
<p>
Conses of two atoms are considered "terminals", that is, they
aren't flattened further.</p>
<p>
See also: `-flatten-n'</p>
<p>
(fn L)<a name="autoload-print-form"></a>
<h3>Function: autoload-print-form</h3>
Print FORM such that `make-docfile' will find the docstrings.

<p>
(fn GENERIC)<a name="handle-switch-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: handle-switch-frame</h3>
Handle a switch-frame event EVENT.
Switch-frame events are usually bound to this function.
A switch-frame event tells Emacs that the window manager has requested
that the user's events be directed to the frame mentioned in the event.
This function selects the selected window of the frame of EVENT.</p>
<p>
If EVENT is frame object, handle it as if it were a switch-frame event
to that frame.</p>
<p>
(fn EVENT)<a name="rotate-yank-pointer"></a>
<h3>Function: rotate-yank-pointer</h3>
Rotate the yanking point in the kill ring.
With ARG, rotate that many kills forward (or backward, if negative).<a name="tabulated-list-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: tabulated-list-mode</h3>
Generic major mode for browsing a list of items.
This mode is usually not used directly; instead, other major
modes are derived from it, using `define-derived-mode'.</p>
<p>
In this major mode, the buffer is divided into multiple columns,
which are labeled using the header line.  Each non-empty line
belongs to one "entry", and the entries can be sorted according
to their column values.</p>
<p>
An inheriting mode should usually do the following in their body:</p>
<p>
 - Set `tabulated-list-format', specifying the column format.
 - Set `tabulated-list-revert-hook', if the buffer contents need
   to be specially recomputed prior to `revert-buffer'.
 - Maybe set a `tabulated-list-entries' function (see below).
 - Maybe set `tabulated-list-printer' (see below).
 - Maybe set `tabulated-list-padding'.
 - Call `tabulated-list-init-header' to initialize `header-line-format'
   according to `tabulated-list-format'.</p>
<p>
An inheriting mode is usually accompanied by a "list-FOO"
command (e.g. `list-packages', `list-processes').  This command
creates or switches to a buffer and enables the major mode in
that buffer.  If `tabulated-list-entries' is not a function, the
command should initialize it to a list of entries for displaying.
Finally, it should call `tabulated-list-print'.</p>
<p>
`tabulated-list-print' calls the printer function specified by
`tabulated-list-printer', once for each entry.  The default
printer is `tabulated-list-print-entry', but a mode that keeps
data in an ewoc may instead specify a printer function (e.g., one
that calls `ewoc-enter-last'), with `tabulated-list-print-entry'
as the ewoc pretty-printer.</p>
<p>
In addition to any hooks its parent mode `special-mode' might have run,
this mode runs the hook `tabulated-list-mode-hook', as the final step
during initialization.</p>

(fn)<a name="scroll-left"></a>
<h3>Function: scroll-left</h3>
Scroll selected window display ARG columns left.
Default for ARG is window width minus 2.
Value is the total amount of leftward horizontal scrolling in
effect after the change.
If SET-MINIMUM is non-nil, the new scroll amount becomes the
lower bound for automatic scrolling, i.e. automatic scrolling
will not scroll a window to a column less than the value returned

Optional third arg FRAME-OR-WINDOW non-nil specifies frame or window.
If optional fourth arg WHOLE is non-nil, X is relative to the left
edge of the window.</p>
<p>
The return value is similar to a mouse click position:

<h3>Function: assoc-string</h3>
Like `assoc' but specifically for strings (and symbols).</p>
<p>
This returns the first element of LIST whose car matches the string or
symbol KEY, or nil if no match exists.  When performing the
comparison, symbols are first converted to strings, and unibyte
strings to multibyte.  If the optional arg CASE-FOLD is non-nil, case
is ignored.</p>

Unlike `assoc', KEY can also match an entry in LIST consisting of a
single string, rather than a cons cell whose car is a string.</p>
<p>
(fn KEY LIST &optional CASE-FOLD)<a name="set-file-name-coding-system"></a>
<h3>Function: set-file-name-coding-system</h3>
Set coding system for decoding and encoding file names to CODING-SYSTEM.
It actually just set the variable `file-name-coding-system' (which see)
to CODING-SYSTEM.<a name="file-expand-wildcards"></a>
<h3>Function: file-expand-wildcards</h3>
Expand wildcard pattern PATTERN.
This returns a list of file names which match the pattern.</p>
<p>
If PATTERN is written as an absolute file name,
the values are absolute also.</p>
<p>
If PATTERN is written as a relative file name, it is interpreted
relative to the current default directory, `default-directory'.
The file names returned are normally also relative to the current
default directory.  However, if FULL is non-nil, they are absolute.<a name="ispell-command-loop"></a>
<h3>Function: ispell-command-loop</h3>
Display possible corrections from list MISS.
GUESS lists possibly valid affix construction of WORD.
Returns nil to keep word.
Returns 0 to insert locally into buffer-local dictionary.
Returns string for new chosen word.
Returns list for new replacement word (will be rechecked).
  Query-replace when list length is 2.
  Automatic query-replace when second element is `query-replace'.
Highlights the word, which is assumed to run from START to END.
Global `ispell-pdict-modified-p' becomes a list where the only value

(fn PROC)<a name="cl-delete-if-not"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-delete-if-not</h3>
Remove all items not satisfying PREDICATE in SEQ.
This is a destructive function; it reuses the storage of SEQ whenever possible.</p>
<p>
Keywords supported:  :key :count :start :end :from-end</p>
<p>
(fn PREDICATE SEQ [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="rlogin"></a>
<h3>Function: rlogin</h3>
Open a network login connection via `rlogin' with args INPUT-ARGS.
INPUT-ARGS should start with a host name; it may also contain
other arguments for `rlogin'.</p>
<p>
Input is sent line-at-a-time to the remote connection.</p>
<p>
Communication with the remote host is recorded in a buffer `*rlogin-HOST*'
(or `*rlogin-USER@HOST*' if the remote username differs).
If a prefix argument is given and the buffer `*rlogin-HOST*' already exists,
a new buffer with a different connection will be made.</p>
<p>
When called from a program, if the optional second argument BUFFER is
a string or buffer, it specifies the buffer to use.</p>
<p>
The variable `rlogin-program' contains the name of the actual program to
run.  It can be a relative or absolute path.</p>
<p>
The variable `rlogin-explicit-args' is a list of arguments to give to
the rlogin when starting.  They are added after any arguments given in
INPUT-ARGS.</p>
<p>
If the default value of `rlogin-directory-tracking-mode' is t, then the
default directory in that buffer is set to a remote (FTP) file name to
access your home directory on the remote machine.  Occasionally this causes
an error, if you cannot access the home directory on that machine.  This
error is harmless as long as you don't try to use that default directory.</p>
<p>
If `rlogin-directory-tracking-mode' is neither t nor nil, then the default
directory is initially set up to your (local) home directory.
This is useful if the remote machine and your local machine
share the same files via NFS.  This is the default.</p>
<p>
If you wish to change directory tracking styles during a session, use the
function `rlogin-directory-tracking-mode' rather than simply setting the
variable.</p>

Hide all subdirectories, leaving only their header lines.
If there is already something hidden, make everything visible again.
Use M-x dired-hide-subdir to (un)hide a particular subdirectory.<a name="comment-region"></a>
<h3>Function: comment-region</h3>
Comment or uncomment each line in the region.
With just C-u prefix arg, uncomment each line in region BEG .. END.
Numeric prefix ARG means use ARG comment characters.
If ARG is negative, delete that many comment characters instead.</p>
<p>
The strings used as comment starts are built from `comment-start'
and `comment-padding'; the strings used as comment ends are built
from `comment-end' and `comment-padding'.</p>
<p>
By default, the `comment-start' markers are inserted at the
current indentation of the region, and comments are terminated on
each line (even for syntaxes in which newline does not end the
comment and blank lines do not get comments).  This can be
changed with `comment-style'.</p>
<p>
(fn BEG END &optional ARG)<a name="cancel-function-timers"></a>

<h3>Function: font-lock-prepend-text-property</h3>
Prepend to one property of the text from START to END.
Arguments PROP and VALUE specify the property and value to prepend to the value
already in place.  The resulting property values are always lists.
Optional argument OBJECT is the string or buffer containing the text.<a name="url-file-extension"></a>
<h3>Function: url-file-extension</h3>
Return the filename extension of FNAME.
If optional argument X is t, then return the basename
of the file with the extension stripped off.<a name="local-set-key"></a>
<h3>Function: local-set-key</h3>
Give KEY a local binding as COMMAND.
COMMAND is the command definition to use; usually it is
a symbol naming an interactively-callable function.
KEY is a key sequence; noninteractively, it is a string or vector
of characters or event types, and non-ASCII characters with codes
above 127 (such as ISO Latin-1) can be included if you use a vector.</p>
<p>
The binding goes in the current buffer's local map,
which in most cases is shared with all other buffers in the same major mode.<a name="char-or-string-p"></a>
<h3>Function: char-or-string-p</h3>
Return t if OBJECT is a character or a string.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT)<a name="recursive-edit"></a>
<h3>Function: recursive-edit</h3>
Invoke the editor command loop recursively.
To get out of the recursive edit, a command can do `(throw 'exit nil)';
that tells this function to return.
Alternatively, `(throw 'exit t)' makes this function signal an error.
This function is called by the editor initialization to begin editing.</p>

<h3>Function: flycheck-string-list-p</h3>
Determine if OBJ is a list of strings.<a name="Info-find-in-tag-table-1"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-find-in-tag-table-1</h3>
Find a node in a tag table.
MARKER specifies the buffer and position to start searching at.
REGEXP is a regular expression matching nodes or references.  Its first
group should match `Node:' or `Ref:'.
CASE-FOLD t means search for a case-insensitive match.
If a match was found, value is a list (FOUND-ANCHOR POS MODE), where
FOUND-ANCHOR is non-nil if a `Ref:' was matched, POS is the position
where the match was found, and MODE is `major-mode' of the buffer in
which the match was found.<a name="shell-quote-argument"></a>
<h3>Function: shell-quote-argument</h3>
Quote ARGUMENT for passing as argument to an inferior shell.<a name="directory-file-name"></a>
<h3>Function: directory-file-name</h3>
Returns the file name of the directory named DIRECTORY.
This is the name of the file that holds the data for the directory DIRECTORY.
This operation exists because a directory is also a file, but its name as
a directory is different from its name as a file.
In Unix-syntax, this function just removes the final slash.</p>
<p>
(fn DIRECTORY)<a name="image-load-path-for-library"></a>
<h3>Function: image-load-path-for-library</h3>
Return a suitable search path for images used by LIBRARY.</p>
<p>
It searches for IMAGE in `image-load-path' (excluding
"`data-directory'/images") and `load-path', followed by a path
suitable for LIBRARY, which includes "../../etc/images" and
"../etc/images" relative to the library file itself, and then
in "`data-directory'/images".</p>
<p>
Then this function returns a list of directories which contains
first the directory in which IMAGE was found, followed by the
value of `load-path'.  If PATH is given, it is used instead of
`load-path'.</p>
<p>
If NO-ERROR is non-nil and a suitable path can't be found, don't
signal an error.  Instead, return a list of directories as before,
except that nil appears in place of the image directory.</p>
<p>
Here is an example that uses a common idiom to provide
compatibility with versions of Emacs that lack the variable
`image-load-path':</p>

<h3>Function: pcomplete-expand</h3>
Expand the textual value of the current argument.
This will modify the current buffer.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="ispell-minor-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: ispell-minor-mode</h3>
Toggle last-word spell checking (Ispell minor mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Ispell minor mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Ispell minor mode is a buffer-local minor mode.  When enabled,
typing SPC or RET warns you if the previous word is incorrectly
spelled.</p>
<p>
All the buffer-local variables and dictionaries are ignored.  To
read them into the running ispell process, type M-$
SPC.</p>
<p>
For spell-checking "on the fly", not just after typing SPC or
RET, use `flyspell-mode'.<a name="ert"></a>
<h3>Function: ert</h3>
Run the tests specified by SELECTOR and display the results in a buffer.</p>
<p>
SELECTOR works as described in `ert-select-tests'.
OUTPUT-BUFFER-NAME and MESSAGE-FN should normally be nil; they
are used for automated self-tests and specify which buffer to use
and how to display message.<a name="set-selection-coding-system"></a>
<h3>Function: set-selection-coding-system</h3>
Make CODING-SYSTEM used for communicating with other X clients.
When sending or receiving text via cut_buffer, selection, and clipboard,
the text is encoded or decoded by CODING-SYSTEM.<a name="buffer-substring"></a>
<h3>Function: buffer-substring</h3>
Return the contents of part of the current buffer as a string.
The two arguments START and END are character positions;
they can be in either order.
The string returned is multibyte if the buffer is multibyte.</p>
<p>
This function copies the text properties of that part of the buffer
into the result string; if you don't want the text properties,
use `buffer-substring-no-properties' instead.</p>
<p>
(fn START END)<a name="overlay-properties"></a>
<h3>Function: overlay-properties</h3>
Return a list of the properties on OVERLAY.
This is a copy of OVERLAY's plist; modifying its conses has no effect on
OVERLAY.</p>
<p>
(fn OVERLAY)<a name="mail-encode-encoded-word-region"></a>
<h3>Function: mail-encode-encoded-word-region</h3>
Encode words in region B to E that need encoding.
By default, the region is treated as containing RFC2822 addresses.
Dynamically bind `rfc2047-encoding-type' to change that.<a name="delete-duplicates"></a>
<h3>Function: delete-duplicates</h3>
Remove all duplicate elements from SEQ (destructively).</p>
<p>
Keywords supported:  :test :test-not :key :start :end :from-end</p>
<p>
(fn SEQ [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="dnd-insert-text"></a>
<h3>Function: dnd-insert-text</h3>
Insert text at point or push to the kill ring if buffer is read only.
TEXT is the text as a string, WINDOW is the window where the drop happened.<a name="popup-menu"></a>
<h3>Function: popup-menu</h3>
Popup the given menu and call the selected option.
MENU can be a keymap, an easymenu-style menu or a list of keymaps as for
`x-popup-menu'.
The menu is shown at the place where POSITION specifies. About
the form of POSITION, see `popup-menu-normalize-position'.
PREFIX is the prefix argument (if any) to pass to the command.</p>
<p>
(fn MENU &optional POSITION PREFIX)<a name="ansi-color-process-output"></a>
<h3>Function: ansi-color-process-output</h3>
Maybe translate SGR control sequences of comint output into text properties.</p>
<p>
Depending on variable `ansi-color-for-comint-mode' the comint output is
either not processed, SGR control sequences are filtered using
`ansi-color-filter-region', or SGR control sequences are translated into
text properties using `ansi-color-apply-on-region'.</p>
<p>
The comint output is assumed to lie between the marker
`comint-last-output-start' and the process-mark.</p>
<p>
This is a good function to put in `comint-output-filter-functions'.<a name="sieve-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: sieve-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing Sieve code.
This is much like C mode except for the syntax of comments.  Its keymap
inherits from C mode's and it has the same variables for customizing
indentation.  It has its own abbrev table and its own syntax table.</p>
<p>
Turning on Sieve mode runs `sieve-mode-hook'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="set-buffer-file-coding-system"></a>
<h3>Function: set-buffer-file-coding-system</h3>
Set the file coding-system of the current buffer to CODING-SYSTEM.
This means that when you save the buffer, it will be converted
according to CODING-SYSTEM.  For a list of possible values of
CODING-SYSTEM, use M-x list-coding-systems.</p>
<p>
If CODING-SYSTEM leaves the text conversion unspecified, or if it leaves
the end-of-line conversion unspecified, FORCE controls what to do.
If FORCE is nil, get the unspecified aspect (or aspects) from the buffer's
previous `buffer-file-coding-system' value (if it is specified there).
Otherwise, leave it unspecified.</p>
<p>
This marks the buffer modified so that the succeeding C-x C-s
surely saves the buffer with CODING-SYSTEM.  From a program, if you
don't want to mark the buffer modified, specify t for NOMODIFY.
If you know exactly what coding system you want to use,
just set the variable `buffer-file-coding-system' directly.<a name="custom-save-variables"></a>

<p>
(fn URL CALLBACK CBARGS)<a name="documentation-property"></a>
<h3>Function: documentation-property</h3>
Return the documentation string that is SYMBOL's PROP property.
Third argument RAW omitted or nil means pass the result through
`substitute-command-keys' if it is a string.</p>
<p>
This differs from `get' in that it can refer to strings stored in the
`etc/DOC' file; and that it evaluates documentation properties that
aren't strings.</p>
<p>
(fn SYMBOL PROP &optional RAW)<a name="internal-copy-lisp-face"></a>
<h3>Function: internal-copy-lisp-face</h3>
Copy face FROM to TO.
If FRAME is t, copy the global face definition of FROM.

<p>
(fn)<a name="flycheck-copy-errors-as-kill"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-copy-errors-as-kill</h3>
Copy each error at POS into kill ring, using FORMATTER.</p>
<p>
FORMATTER is a function to turn an error into a string,
defaulting to `flycheck-error-message'.</p>
<p>
Interactively, use `flycheck-error-format-message-and-id' as
FORMATTER with universal prefix arg, and `flycheck-error-id' with
normal prefix arg, i.e. copy the message and the ID with
universal prefix arg, and only the id with normal prefix arg.<a name="macroexp--warn-and-return"></a>
<h3>Function: macroexp--warn-and-return</h3></p>
<p>

(fn MSG FORM)<a name="switch-to-buffer-other-window"></a>
<h3>Function: switch-to-buffer-other-window</h3>
Select the buffer specified by BUFFER-OR-NAME in another window.
BUFFER-OR-NAME may be a buffer, a string (a buffer name), or
nil.  Return the buffer switched to.</p>
<p>
If called interactively, prompt for the buffer name using the
minibuffer.  The variable `confirm-nonexistent-file-or-buffer'
determines whether to request confirmation before creating a new
buffer.</p>
<p>
If BUFFER-OR-NAME is a string and does not identify an existing
buffer, create a new buffer with that name.  If BUFFER-OR-NAME is
nil, switch to the buffer returned by `other-buffer'.</p>
<p>
Optional second argument NORECORD non-nil means do not put this
buffer at the front of the list of recently selected ones.</p>
<p>
This uses the function `display-buffer' as a subroutine; see its
documentation for additional customization information.<a name="iso-gtex2iso"></a>
<h3>Function: iso-gtex2iso</h3>

<h3>Function: windmove-left</h3>
Select the window to the left of the current one.
With no prefix argument, or with prefix argument equal to zero,
"left" is relative to the position of point in the window; otherwise
it is relative to the top edge (for positive ARG) or the bottom edge
(for negative ARG) of the current window.
If no window is at the desired location, an error is signaled.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="ffap-menu"></a>
<h3>Function: ffap-menu</h3>
Put up a menu of files and URLs mentioned in this buffer.
Then set mark, jump to choice, and try to fetch it.  The menu is
cached in `ffap-menu-alist', and rebuilt by `ffap-menu-rescan'.

<h3>Function: url-scheme-default-loader</h3>
Signal an error for an unknown URL scheme.<a name="toggle-enable-multibyte-characters"></a>
<h3>Function: toggle-enable-multibyte-characters</h3>
Change whether this buffer uses multibyte characters.
With ARG, use multibyte characters if the ARG is positive.</p>
<p>
Note that this command does not convert the byte contents of
the buffer; it only changes the way those bytes are interpreted.
In general, therefore, this command *changes* the sequence of
characters that the current buffer contains.</p>
<p>
We suggest you avoid using this command unless you know what you are
doing.  If you use it by mistake, and the buffer is now displayed
wrong, use this command again to toggle back to the right mode.<a name="sendmail-user-agent-compose"></a>

<h3>Function: vc-up-to-date-p</h3>
Convenience function that checks whether `vc-state' of FILE is `up-to-date'.<a name="sql-sybase"></a>
<h3>Function: sql-sybase</h3>
Run isql by Sybase as an inferior process.</p>
<p>
If buffer `*SQL*' exists but no process is running, make a new process.
If buffer exists and a process is running, just switch to buffer
`*SQL*'.</p>
<p>
Interpreter used comes from variable `sql-sybase-program'.  Login uses
the variables `sql-server', `sql-user', `sql-password', and
`sql-database' as defaults, if set.  Additional command line parameters
can be stored in the list `sql-sybase-options'.</p>
<p>
The buffer is put in SQL interactive mode, giving commands for sending
input.  See `sql-interactive-mode'.</p>
<p>
To set the buffer name directly, use C-u
before M-x sql-sybase.  Once session has started,
M-x sql-rename-buffer can be called separately to rename the
buffer.</p>
<p>
To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the input and output to the process, use C-x RET c
before M-x sql-sybase.  You can also specify this with C-x RET p
in the SQL buffer, after you start the process.
The default comes from `process-coding-system-alist' and
`default-process-coding-system'.</p>
<p>
(Type C-h m in the SQL buffer for a list of commands.)</p>
<p>
(fn &optional BUFFER)<a name="double-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: double-mode</h3>

<h3>Function: ido-switch-buffer</h3>
Switch to another buffer.
The buffer is displayed according to `ido-default-buffer-method' -- the
default is to show it in the same window, unless it is already visible
in another frame.</p>
<p>
As you type in a string, all of the buffers matching the string are
displayed if substring-matching is used (default).  Look at
`ido-enable-prefix' and `ido-toggle-prefix'.  When you have found the
buffer you want, it can then be selected.  As you type, most keys have
their normal keybindings, except for the following: 
Uses keymap `ido-buffer-completion-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: window-resize</h3>
Resize WINDOW vertically by DELTA lines.
WINDOW can be an arbitrary window and defaults to the selected
one.  An attempt to resize the root window of a frame will raise
an error though.</p>
<p>
DELTA a positive number means WINDOW shall be enlarged by DELTA
lines.  DELTA negative means WINDOW shall be shrunk by -DELTA
lines.</p>
<p>
Optional argument HORIZONTAL non-nil means resize WINDOW

<p>
FORMAT-COUNT is an integer specifying how many times this function has
been called in the process of decoding ORIG-BUF.</p>
<p>
This function works like a function in `write-region-annotate-functions':
it either returns a list of annotations, or returns with a different buffer
current, which contains the modified text to write.  In the latter case,
this function's value is nil.</p>

instead of the trailing one.  (This is meant to make C-x z work well
with negative arguments.)
If COUNT is zero, kill current line but exclude the trailing newline.
The read-only status of newlines is updated with `comint-update-fence',
if necessary.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional COUNT)<a name="common-lisp-indent-function"></a>
<h3>Function: common-lisp-indent-function</h3>
Function to indent the arguments of a Lisp function call.
This is suitable for use as the value of the variable
`lisp-indent-function'.  INDENT-POINT is the point at which the
indentation function is called, and STATE is the
`parse-partial-sexp' state at that position.  Browse the
`lisp-indent' customize group for options affecting the behavior
of this function.</p>
<p>
If the indentation point is in a call to a Lisp function, that
function's `common-lisp-indent-function' property specifies how
this function should indent it.  Possible values for this
property are:</p>
<p>
* defun, meaning indent according to `lisp-indent-defun-method';
  i.e., like (4 &lambda &body), as explained below.</p>
<p>
* any other symbol, meaning a function to call.  The function should
  take the arguments: PATH STATE INDENT-POINT SEXP-COLUMN NORMAL-INDENT.
  PATH is a list of integers describing the position of point in terms of
  list-structure with respect to the containing lists.  For example, in
  ((a b c (d foo) f) g), foo has a path of (0 3 1).  In other words,
  to reach foo take the 0th element of the outermost list, then
  the 3rd element of the next list, and finally the 1st element.
  STATE and INDENT-POINT are as in the arguments to
  `common-lisp-indent-function'.  SEXP-COLUMN is the column of
  the open parenthesis of the innermost containing list.
  NORMAL-INDENT is the column the indentation point was
  originally in.  This function should behave like `lisp-indent-259'.</p>
<p>
* an integer N, meaning indent the first N arguments like
  function arguments, and any further arguments like a body.
  This is equivalent to (4 4 ... &body).</p>
<p>
* a list.  The list element in position M specifies how to indent the Mth
  function argument.  If there are fewer elements than function arguments,
  the last list element applies to all remaining arguments.  The accepted
  list elements are:</p>
<p>
  * nil, meaning the default indentation.</p>
<p>
  * an integer, specifying an explicit indentation.</p>
<p>
  * &lambda.  Indent the argument (which may be a list) by 4.</p>
<p>
  * &rest.  When used, this must be the penultimate element.  The
    element after this one applies to all remaining arguments.</p>
<p>
  * &body.  This is equivalent to &rest lisp-body-indent, i.e., indent
    all remaining elements by `lisp-body-indent'.</p>
<p>
  * &whole.  This must be followed by nil, an integer, or a
    function symbol.  This indentation is applied to the
    associated argument, and as a base indent for all remaining
    arguments.  For example, an integer P means indent this
    argument by P, and all remaining arguments by P, plus the
    value specified by their associated list element.</p>
<p>
  * a symbol.  A function to call, with the 6 arguments specified above.</p>
<p>
  * a list, with elements as described above.  This applies when the
    associated function argument is itself a list.  Each element of the list
    specifies how to indent the associated argument.</p>
<p>
For example, the function `case' has an indent property
(4 &rest (&whole 2 &rest 1)), meaning:
  * indent the first argument by 4.
  * arguments after the first should be lists, and there may be any number
    of them.  The first list element has an offset of 2, all the rest
    have an offset of 2+1=3.<a name="bug-reference-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: bug-reference-mode</h3>
Toggle hyperlinking bug references in the buffer (Bug Reference mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Bug Reference mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: byte-compile-and</h3></p>
<p>

(fn FORM)<a name="easy-menu-define-key"></a>
<h3>Function: easy-menu-define-key</h3>
Add binding in MENU for KEY => ITEM.  Similar to `define-key-after'.
If KEY is not nil then delete any duplications.
If ITEM is nil, then delete the definition of KEY.</p>
<p>
Optional argument BEFORE is nil or a key in MENU.  If BEFORE is not nil,
put binding before the item in MENU named BEFORE; otherwise,
if a binding for KEY is already present in MENU, just change it;
otherwise put the new binding last in MENU.
BEFORE can be either a string (menu item name) or a symbol
(the fake function key for the menu item).
KEY does not have to be a symbol, and comparison is done with equal.<a name="make-frame-command"></a>
<h3>Function: make-frame-command</h3>
Make a new frame, on the same terminal as the selected frame.
If the terminal is a text-only terminal, this also selects the
new frame.<a name="table-unrecognize-table"></a>

<p>

(fn)<a name="ps-spool-region"></a>
<h3>Function: ps-spool-region</h3>
Generate a PostScript image of the region and spool locally.
Like `ps-spool-buffer', but spools just the current region.</p>
<p>
Use the command `ps-despool' to send the spooled images to the printer.</p>
<p>
(fn FROM TO)<a name="region-active-p"></a>
<h3>Function: region-active-p</h3>
Return t if Transient Mark mode is enabled and the mark is active.</p>
<p>
Some commands act specially on the region when Transient Mark
mode is enabled.  Usually, such commands should use
`use-region-p' instead of this function, because `use-region-p'
also checks the value of `use-empty-active-region'.<a name="charset-priority-list"></a>
<h3>Function: charset-priority-list</h3>
Return the list of charsets ordered by priority.
HIGHESTP non-nil means just return the highest priority one.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional HIGHESTP)<a name="vector"></a>
<h3>Function: vector</h3>
Return a newly created vector with specified arguments as elements.
Any number of arguments, even zero arguments, are allowed.</p>
<p>
(fn &rest OBJECTS)<a name="flycheck-error-thing-region"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-error-thing-region</h3>
Get the region of THING at the column of ERR.</p>
<p>
ERR is a Flycheck error whose region to get.  THING is a
understood by `thing-at-point'.</p>
<p>
Return a cons cell `(BEG . END)' where BEG is the beginning of
the THING at the error column, and END the end of the symbol.  If
ERR has no error column, or if there is no THING at this column,
return nil.<a name="flycheck-register-option-var"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-register-option-var</h3>
Register an option VAR with CHECKERS.</p>
<p>
VAR is an option symbol, and CHECKERS a syntax checker symbol or
a list thereof.  Register VAR with all CHECKERS so that it
appears in the help output.<a name="dired-goto-next-file"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-goto-next-file</h3></p>
<p>

(fn)<a name="comint-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-mode</h3>
Major mode for interacting with an inferior interpreter.
Interpreter name is same as buffer name, sans the asterisks.
Return at end of buffer sends line as input.
Return not at end copies rest of line to end and sends it.
Setting variable `comint-eol-on-send' means jump to the end of the line
before submitting new input.</p>
<p>
This mode is customized to create major modes such as Inferior Lisp
mode, Shell mode, etc.  This can be done by setting the hooks
`comint-input-filter-functions', `comint-input-filter', `comint-input-sender'
and `comint-get-old-input' to appropriate functions, and the variable
`comint-prompt-regexp' to the appropriate regular expression.</p>
<p>
The mode maintains an input history of size `comint-input-ring-size'.
You can access this with the commands M-x comint-next-input,
M-x comint-previous-input, and M-x comint-dynamic-list-input-ring.
Input ring history expansion can be achieved with the commands
M-x comint-replace-by-expanded-history or M-x comint-magic-space.
Input ring expansion is controlled by the variable `comint-input-autoexpand',
and addition is controlled by the variable `comint-input-ignoredups'.</p>
<p>
Commands with no default key bindings include `send-invisible',
`comint-dynamic-complete', `comint-dynamic-list-filename-completions', and
`comint-magic-space'.</p>
<p>
Input to, and output from, the subprocess can cause the window to scroll to
the end of the buffer.  See variables `comint-output-filter-functions',
`comint-preoutput-filter-functions', `comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-input',
and `comint-move-point-for-output'.</p>
<p>
If you accidentally suspend your process, use M-x comint-continue-subjob
to continue it.</p>

Return the eighth element of the list X.</p>
<p>
(fn X)<a name="help-at-pt-string"></a>
<h3>Function: help-at-pt-string</h3>
Return the help-echo string at point.
Normally, the string produced by the `help-echo' text or overlay
property, or nil, is returned.
If KBD is non-nil, `kbd-help' is used instead, and any
`help-echo' property is ignored.  In this case, the return value
can also be t, if that is the value of the `kbd-help' property.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional KBD)<a name="c-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: c-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing K&R and ANSI C code.
To submit a problem report, enter `M-x c-submit-bug-report' from a
c-mode buffer.  This automatically sets up a mail buffer with version
information already added.  You just need to add a description of the
problem, including a reproducible test case, and send the message.</p>
<p>
To see what version of CC Mode you are running, enter `M-x c-version'.</p>
<p>
The hook `c-mode-common-hook' is run with no args at mode
initialization, then `c-mode-hook'.</p>

Move past next `)', delete indentation before it, then indent after it.<a name="-unfold"></a>
<h3>Function: -unfold</h3>
Build a list from SEED using FUN.</p>
<p>
This is "dual" operation to `-reduce-r': while -reduce-r
consumes a list to produce a single value, `-unfold' takes a
seed value and builds a (potentially infinite!) list.</p>
<p>
FUN should return `nil' to stop the generating process, or a
cons (A . B), where A will be prepended to the result and B is
the new seed.</p>

(fn)<a name="image-type-from-file-name"></a>
<h3>Function: image-type-from-file-name</h3>
Determine the type of image file FILE from its name.
Value is a symbol specifying the image type, or nil if type cannot
be determined.<a name="find-definition-noselect"></a>
<h3>Function: find-definition-noselect</h3>
Return a pair `(BUFFER . POINT)' pointing to the definition of SYMBOL.
If the definition can't be found in the buffer, return (BUFFER).
TYPE says what type of definition: nil for a function, `defvar' for a
variable, `defface' for a face.  This function does not switch to the
buffer nor display it.</p>
<p>
The library where SYMBOL is defined is searched for in FILE or
`find-function-source-path', if non-nil, otherwise in `load-path'.<a name="-group-by"></a>

(fn NAME)<a name="rfn-eshadow-update-overlay"></a>
<h3>Function: rfn-eshadow-update-overlay</h3>
Update `rfn-eshadow-overlay' to cover shadowed part of minibuffer input.
This is intended to be used as a minibuffer `post-command-hook' for
`file-name-shadow-mode'; the minibuffer should have already
been set up by `rfn-eshadow-setup-minibuffer'.<a name="timer-activate-when-idle"></a>
<h3>Function: timer-activate-when-idle</h3>
Insert TIMER into `timer-idle-list'.
This arranges to activate TIMER whenever Emacs is next idle.
If optional argument DONT-WAIT is non-nil, set TIMER to activate
immediately (see below), or at the right time, if Emacs is
already idle.</p>
<p>
REUSE-CELL, if non-nil, is a cons cell to reuse when inserting
TIMER into `timer-idle-list' (usually a cell removed from that
list by `cancel-timer-internal'; using this reduces consing for
repeat timers).  If nil, allocate a new cell.</p>
<p>
Using non-nil DONT-WAIT is not recommended when activating an
idle timer from an idle timer handler, if the timer being
activated has an idleness time that is smaller or equal to
the time of the current timer.  That's because the activated
timer will fire right away.<a name="move-marker"></a>
<h3>Function: move-marker</h3>
Position MARKER before character number POSITION in BUFFER,
which defaults to the current buffer.  If POSITION is nil,
makes marker point nowhere so it no longer slows down
editing in any buffer.  Returns MARKER.</p>
<p>
(fn MARKER POSITION &optional BUFFER)<a name="global-set-key"></a>
<h3>Function: global-set-key</h3>
Give KEY a global binding as COMMAND.
COMMAND is the command definition to use; usually it is
a symbol naming an interactively-callable function.
KEY is a key sequence; noninteractively, it is a string or vector
of characters or event types, and non-ASCII characters with codes
above 127 (such as ISO Latin-1) can be included if you use a vector.</p>
<p>
Note that if KEY has a local binding in the current buffer,
that local binding will continue to shadow any global binding
that you make with this function.<a name="tar-swap-data"></a>

Major mode for editing Git log messages.
It is based on `log-edit-mode', and has Git-specific extensions.</p>
<p>
In addition to any hooks its parent mode might have run,
this mode runs the hook `vc-git-log-edit-mode-hook', as the final step
during initialization.</p>

<h3>Function: set-input-method</h3>
Select and activate input method INPUT-METHOD for the current buffer.
This also sets the default input method to the one you specify.
If INPUT-METHOD is nil, this function turns off the input method, and
also causes you to be prompted for a name of an input method the next
time you invoke C-\.
When called interactively, the optional arg INTERACTIVE is non-nil,
which marks the variable `default-input-method' as set for Custom buffers.</p>
<p>
To deactivate the input method interactively, use C-\.
To deactivate it programmatically, use `deactivate-input-method'.<a name="mail-quote-printable"></a>
<h3>Function: mail-quote-printable</h3>
Convert a string to the "quoted printable" Q encoding if necessary.
If the string contains only ASCII characters and no troublesome ones,
we return it unconverted.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument WRAPPER is non-nil,
we add the wrapper characters =?ISO-8859-1?Q?....?=.<a name="load-average"></a>
<h3>Function: load-average</h3>
Return list of 1 minute, 5 minute and 15 minute load averages.</p>
<p>
Each of the three load averages is multiplied by 100, then converted
to integer.</p>
<p>
When USE-FLOATS is non-nil, floats will be used instead of integers.
These floats are not multiplied by 100.</p>
<p>
If the 5-minute or 15-minute load averages are not available, return a
shortened list, containing only those averages which are available.</p>
<p>
An error is thrown if the load average can't be obtained.  In some
cases making it work would require Emacs being installed setuid or
setgid so that it can read kernel information, and that usually isn't
advisable.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional USE-FLOATS)<a name="mouse-menu-bar-map"></a>

Return a keymap equivalent to the menu bar.
The contents are the items that would be in the menu bar whether or
not it is actually displayed.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="set-frame-name"></a>
<h3>Function: set-frame-name</h3>
Set the name of the selected frame to NAME.
When called interactively, prompt for the name of the frame.
On text terminals, the frame name is displayed on the mode line.
On graphical displays, it is displayed on the frame's title bar.<a name="hexl-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: hexl-mode</h3></p>
<p>
Uses keymap `hexl-mode-map', which is not currently defined.
A mode for editing binary files in hex dump format.
This is not an ordinary major mode; it alters some aspects
of the current mode's behavior, but not all; also, you can exit
Hexl mode and return to the previous mode using `hexl-mode-exit'.</p>
<p>
This function automatically converts a buffer into the hexl format
using the function `hexlify-buffer'.</p>
<p>
Each line in the buffer has an "address" (displayed in hexadecimal)
representing the offset into the file that the characters on this line
are at and 16 characters from the file (displayed as hexadecimal
values grouped every `hexl-bits' bits) and as their ASCII values.</p>
<p>
If any of the characters (displayed as ASCII characters) are
unprintable (control or meta characters) they will be replaced as
periods.</p>
<p>
If `hexl-mode' is invoked with an argument the buffer is assumed to be
in hexl format.</p>
<p>
A sample format:</p>

Movement is as simple as movement in a normal Emacs text buffer.  Most
cursor movement bindings are the same: use M-x hexl-backward-char, M-x hexl-forward-char, M-x hexl-next-line, and M-x hexl-previous-line
to move the cursor left, right, down, and up.</p>
<p>
Advanced cursor movement commands (ala M-x hexl-beginning-of-line, M-x hexl-end-of-line, M-x hexl-beginning-of-buffer, and M-x hexl-end-of-buffer) are
also supported.</p>
<p>
There are several ways to change text in hexl mode:</p>
<p>
ASCII characters (character between space (0x20) and tilde (0x7E)) are
bound to self-insert so you can simply type the character and it will
insert itself (actually overstrike) into the buffer.</p>
<p>
M-x hexl-quoted-insert followed by another keystroke allows you to insert the key even if
it isn't bound to self-insert.  An octal number can be supplied in place
of another key to insert the octal number's ASCII representation.</p>
<p>
M-x hexl-insert-hex-char will insert a given hexadecimal value (if it is between 0 and 0xFF)
into the buffer at the current point.</p>
<p>
M-x hexl-insert-octal-char will insert a given octal value (if it is between 0 and 0377)
into the buffer at the current point.</p>
<p>
M-x hexl-insert-decimal-char will insert a given decimal value (if it is between 0 and 255)
into the buffer at the current point.</p>
<p>
M-x hexl-mode-exit will exit hexl-mode.</p>
<p>
Note: saving the file with any of the usual Emacs commands
will actually convert it back to binary format while saving.</p>
<p>
You can use M-x hexl-find-file to visit a file in Hexl mode.</p>

<p>
(fn SELECTED)<a name="indent-for-tab-command"></a>
<h3>Function: indent-for-tab-command</h3>
Indent the current line or region, or insert a tab, as appropriate.
This function either inserts a tab, or indents the current line,
or performs symbol completion, depending on `tab-always-indent'.
The function called to actually indent the line or insert a tab
is given by the variable `indent-line-function'.</p>
<p>
If a prefix argument is given, after this function indents the
current line or inserts a tab, it also rigidly indents the entire
balanced expression which starts at the beginning of the current
line, to reflect the current line's indentation.</p>
<p>
In most major modes, if point was in the current line's
indentation, it is moved to the first non-whitespace character
after indenting; otherwise it stays at the same position relative
to the text.</p>
<p>
If `transient-mark-mode' is turned on and the region is active,
this function instead calls `indent-region'.  In this case, any
prefix argument is ignored.<a name="describe-font"></a>

If the current buffer is visiting the file being compared against, it
also will have its differences highlighted.  Otherwise, the file is
read in temporarily but the buffer is deleted.</p>
<p>
If the buffer is read-only, differences will be highlighted but no property
changes are made, so M-x highlight-changes-next-change and
M-x highlight-changes-previous-change will not work.</p>

<p>
If the optional argument MUSTBENEW is non-nil, check for an existing
file with the same name.  If MUSTBENEW is `excl', that means to get an
error if the file already exists; never overwrite.  If MUSTBENEW is
neither nil nor `excl', that means ask for confirmation before
overwriting, but do go ahead and overwrite the file if the user
confirms.  When interactive, MUSTBENEW is nil when appending, and t
otherwise.</p>

<h3>Function: pr-ps-file-up-ps-print</h3>
Process a PostScript file IFILENAME and send it to printer.</p>
<p>
Interactively, the command prompts for N-UP printing number, for an input
PostScript file IFILENAME and, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the
command prompts the user for an output PostScript file name OFILENAME, and
saves the PostScript image in that file instead of sending it to the printer.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, if N-UP is nil, prompts for N-UP printing number.  The
argument IFILENAME is treated as follows: if it's t, prompts for an input
PostScript file name; otherwise, it *must* be a string that it's an input
PostScript file name.  The argument OFILENAME is treated as follows: if it's
nil, send the image to the printer.  If OFILENAME is a string, save the
PostScript image in a file with that name.  If OFILENAME is t, prompts for a
file name.</p>

<h3>Function: ccl-execute-on-string</h3>
Execute CCL-PROGRAM with initial STATUS on STRING.</p>
<p>
CCL-PROGRAM is a symbol registered by `register-ccl-program',
or a compiled code generated by `ccl-compile' (for backward compatibility,
in this case, the execution is slower).</p>
<p>
Read buffer is set to STRING, and write buffer is allocated automatically.</p>
<p>
STATUS is a vector of [R0 R1 ... R7 IC], where
 R0..R7 are initial values of corresponding registers,
 IC is the instruction counter specifying from where to start the program.
If R0..R7 are nil, they are initialized to 0.
If IC is nil, it is initialized to head of the CCL program.</p>
<p>
If optional 4th arg CONTINUE is non-nil, keep IC on read operation
when read buffer is exhausted, else, IC is always set to the end of
CCL-PROGRAM on exit.</p>
<p>
It returns the contents of write buffer as a string,
 and as side effect, STATUS is updated.
If the optional 5th arg UNIBYTE-P is non-nil, the returned string
is a unibyte string.  By default it is a multibyte string.</p>

If point reaches the beginning or end of buffer, it stops there.</p>
<p>
This function constrains point to the current field unless this moves
point to a different line than the original, unconstrained result.
If N is nil or 1, and a front-sticky field starts at point, the point
does not move.  To ignore field boundaries bind
`inhibit-field-text-motion' to t, or use the `forward-line' function
instead.  For instance, `(forward-line 0)' does the same thing as
`(beginning-of-line)', except that it ignores field boundaries.</p>

<h3>Function: dired-file-set-difference</h3>
Combine LIST1 and LIST2 using a set-difference operation.
The result list contains all file items that appear in LIST1 but not LIST2.
This is a non-destructive function; it makes a copy of the data if necessary
to avoid corrupting the original LIST1 and LIST2.
PREDICATE (see `dired-compare-directories') is an additional match
condition.  Two file items are considered to match if they are equal
*and* PREDICATE evaluates to t.<a name="vc-git-stash-apply-at-point"></a>

<p>

(fn)<a name="vc-do-command"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-do-command</h3>
Execute a slave command, notifying user and checking for errors.
Output from COMMAND goes to BUFFER, or the current buffer if
BUFFER is t.  If the destination buffer is not already current,
set it up properly and erase it.  The command is considered
successful if its exit status does not exceed OKSTATUS (if
OKSTATUS is nil, that means to ignore error status, if it is
`async', that means not to wait for termination of the
subprocess; if it is t it means to ignore all execution errors).
FILE-OR-LIST is the name of a working file; it may be a list of
files or be nil (to execute commands that don't expect a file
name or set of files).  If an optional list of FLAGS is present,
that is inserted into the command line before the filename.

Optional argument IGNORE non-nil means ignore restrictions
imposed by fixed size windows, `window-min-height' or
`window-min-width' settings.  If IGNORE equals `safe', live
windows may get as small as `window-safe-min-height' lines and
`window-safe-min-width' columns.  If IGNORE is a window, ignore
restrictions for that window only.  Any other non-nil value means
ignore all of the above restrictions for all windows.<a name="-splice-list"></a>
<h3>Function: -splice-list</h3>
Splice NEW-LIST in place of elements matching PRED in LIST.</p>
<p>
See also: `-splice', `-insert-at'</p>
<p>
(fn PRED NEW-LIST LIST)<a name="byte-compile-variable-set"></a>

<p>
(fn START END)<a name="cfengine3-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: cfengine3-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing CFEngine3 input.
There are no special keybindings by default.</p>
<p>
Action blocks are treated as defuns, i.e. C-M-a moves
to the action header.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="count-windows"></a>
<h3>Function: count-windows</h3>
Return the number of live windows on the selected frame.
The optional argument MINIBUF specifies whether the minibuffer
window shall be counted.  See `walk-windows' for the precise
meaning of this argument.<a name="convert-standard-filename"></a>
<h3>Function: convert-standard-filename</h3>
Convert a standard file's name to something suitable for the OS.
This means to guarantee valid names and perhaps to canonicalize
certain patterns.</p>
<p>
FILENAME should be an absolute file name since the conversion rules
sometimes vary depending on the position in the file name.  E.g. c:/foo
is a valid DOS file name, but c:/bar/c:/foo is not.</p>
<p>
This function's standard definition is trivial; it just returns
the argument.  However, on Windows and DOS, replace invalid
characters.  On DOS, make sure to obey the 8.3 limitations.
In the native Windows build, turn Cygwin names into native names,
and also turn slashes into backslashes if the shell requires it (see
`w32-shell-dos-semantics').</p>
<p>
See Info node `(elisp)Standard File Names' for more details.<a name="handle-delete-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: handle-delete-frame</h3>
Handle delete-frame events from the X server.<a name="window-next-buffers"></a>

<h3>Function: time-stamp-toggle-active</h3>
Toggle `time-stamp-active', setting whether M-x time-stamp updates a buffer.
With ARG, turn time stamping on if and only if arg is positive.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="same-window-p"></a>
<h3>Function: same-window-p</h3>
Return non-nil if a buffer named BUFFER-NAME would be shown in the "same" window.
This function returns non-nil if `display-buffer' or
`pop-to-buffer' would show a buffer named BUFFER-NAME in the
selected rather than (as usual) some other window.  See
`same-window-buffer-names' and `same-window-regexps'.<a name="string-equal"></a>
<h3>Function: string-equal</h3>
Return t if two strings have identical contents.
Case is significant, but text properties are ignored.
Symbols are also allowed; their print names are used instead.</p>
<p>
(fn S1 S2)<a name="ert-test-at-point"></a>
<h3>Function: ert-test-at-point</h3>
Return the name of the test at point as a symbol, or nil if none.<a name="server-edit"></a>
<h3>Function: server-edit</h3>
Switch to next server editing buffer; say "Done" for current buffer.
If a server buffer is current, it is marked "done" and optionally saved.
The buffer is also killed if it did not exist before the clients asked for it.
When all of a client's buffers are marked as "done", the client is notified.</p>
<p>
Temporary files such as MH <draft> files are always saved and backed up,
no questions asked.  (The variable `make-backup-files', if nil, still
inhibits a backup; you can set it locally in a particular buffer to
prevent a backup for it.)  The variable `server-temp-file-regexp' controls
which filenames are considered temporary.</p>
<p>
If invoked with a prefix argument, or if there is no server process running,
starts server process and that is all.  Invoked by C-x #.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="x-dnd-handle-xdnd"></a>
<h3>Function: x-dnd-handle-xdnd</h3>
Receive one XDND event (client message) and send the appropriate reply.
EVENT is the client message.  FRAME is where the mouse is now.
WINDOW is the window within FRAME where the mouse is now.
FORMAT is 32 (not used).  MESSAGE is the data part of an XClientMessageEvent.<a name="facemenu-set-read-only"></a>
<h3>Function: facemenu-set-read-only</h3>
Make the region unmodifiable.
This sets the `read-only' text property; it can be undone with
`facemenu-remove-special'.<a name="master-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: master-mode</h3>
Toggle Master mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Master mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When Master mode is enabled, you can scroll the slave buffer
using the following commands:</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `master-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

The slave buffer is stored in the buffer-local variable `master-of'.
You can set this variable using `master-set-slave'.  You can show
yourself the value of `master-of' by calling `master-show-slave'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="call-last-kbd-macro"></a>
<h3>Function: call-last-kbd-macro</h3>
Call the last keyboard macro that you defined with M-x start-kbd-macro.</p>
<p>
A prefix argument serves as a repeat count.  Zero means repeat until error.</p>
<p>
To make a macro permanent so you can call it even after
defining others, use M-x name-last-kbd-macro.</p>
<p>
In Lisp, optional second arg LOOPFUNC may be a function that is called prior to
each iteration of the macro.  Iteration stops if LOOPFUNC returns nil.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional PREFIX LOOPFUNC)<a name="base64-encode-string"></a>

If the last global mark pushed was not in the current buffer,
also push LOCATION on the global mark ring.
Display `Mark set' unless the optional second arg NOMSG is non-nil.</p>
<p>
Novice Emacs Lisp programmers often try to use the mark for the wrong
purposes.  See the documentation of `set-mark' for more information.</p>
<p>
In Transient Mark mode, activate mark if optional third arg ACTIVATE non-nil.<a name="buffer-modified-p"></a>
<h3>Function: buffer-modified-p</h3>
Return t if BUFFER was modified since its file was last read or saved.
No argument or nil as argument means use current buffer as BUFFER.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional BUFFER)<a name="flycheck-error-list-current-errors"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-error-list-current-errors</h3>
Read the list of errors in `flycheck-error-list-source-buffer'.<a name="gnus-emacs-completing-read"></a>

<p>
(fn)<a name="org-diary"></a>
<h3>Function: org-diary</h3>
Return diary information from org files.
This function can be used in a "sexp" diary entry in the Emacs calendar.
It accesses org files and extracts information from those files to be
listed in the diary.  The function accepts arguments specifying what
items should be listed.  For a list of arguments allowed here, see the
variable `org-agenda-entry-types'.</p>
<p>
The call in the diary file should look like this:</p>
<p>
   &%%(org-diary) ~/path/to/some/orgfile.org</p>
<p>
Use a separate line for each org file to check.  Or, if you omit the file name,
all files listed in `org-agenda-files' will be checked automatically:</p>
<p>
   &%%(org-diary)</p>
<p>
If you don't give any arguments (as in the example above), the default
arguments (:deadline :scheduled :timestamp :sexp) are used.
So the example above may also be written as</p>
<p>
   &%%(org-diary :deadline :timestamp :sexp :scheduled)</p>
<p>
The function expects the lisp variables `entry' and `date' to be provided
by the caller, because this is how the calendar works.  Don't use this
function from a program - use `org-agenda-get-day-entries' instead.</p>
<p>
(fn &rest ARGS)<a name="local-variable-p"></a>

<h3>Function: pcomplete-opt</h3>
Complete a set of OPTIONS, each beginning with PREFIX (?- by default).
PREFIX may be t, in which case no PREFIX character is necessary.
If NO-GANGING is non-nil, each option is separate (-xy is not allowed).
If ARGS-FOLLOW is non-nil, then options which take arguments may have
the argument appear after a ganged set of options.  This is how tar
behaves, for example.
Arguments NO-GANGING and ARGS-FOLLOW are currently ignored.</p>
<p>
(fn OPTIONS &optional PREFIX NO-GANGING ARGS-FOLLOW)<a name="cl-nunion"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-nunion</h3>

(fn SEQ1 SEQ2 [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="ps-print-buffer-with-faces"></a>
<h3>Function: ps-print-buffer-with-faces</h3>
Generate and print a PostScript image of the buffer.
Like `ps-print-buffer', but includes font, color, and underline information in
the generated image.  This command works only if you are using a window system,
so it has a way to determine color values.</p>

After one word is completed as much as possible, a space or hyphen
is added, provided that matches some possible completion.
Return nil if there is no valid completion, else t.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="gnus-notifications"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-notifications</h3>
Send a notification on new message.
This check for new messages that are in group with a level lower
or equal to `gnus-notifications-minimum-level' and send a
notification using `notifications-notify' for it.</p>
<p>
This is typically a function to add in
`gnus-after-getting-new-news-hook'</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="dired"></a>
<h3>Function: dired</h3>
"Edit" directory DIRNAME--delete, rename, print, etc. some files in it.
Optional second argument SWITCHES specifies the `ls' options used.
(Interactively, use a prefix argument to be able to specify SWITCHES.)
Dired displays a list of files in DIRNAME (which may also have
shell wildcards appended to select certain files).  If DIRNAME is a cons,
its first element is taken as the directory name and the rest as an explicit
list of files to make directory entries for.
You can flag files for deletion with d and then
delete them by typing x.
Type h after entering Dired for more info.</p>
<p>

just return nil (no error).<a name="Info-find-node-in-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-find-node-in-buffer</h3>
Find a node or anchor in the current buffer.
REGEXP is a regular expression matching nodes or references.  Its first
group should match `Node:' or `Ref:'.
Value is the position at which a match was found, or nil if not found.
This function looks for a case-sensitive match first.  If none is found,
a case-insensitive match is tried.<a name="describe-class"></a>
<h3>Function: describe-class</h3>
Describe a CLASS defined by a string or symbol.
If CLASS is actually an object, then also display current values of that object.
Optional HEADERFCN should be called to insert a few bits of info first.</p>
<p>
(fn CLASS &optional HEADERFCN)<a name="temp-buffer-window-show"></a>
<h3>Function: temp-buffer-window-show</h3>

<h3>Function: posix-search-forward</h3>
Search forward from point for regular expression REGEXP.
Find the longest match in accord with Posix regular expression rules.
Set point to the end of the occurrence found, and return point.
An optional second argument bounds the search; it is a buffer position.
The match found must not extend after that position.
Optional third argument, if t, means if fail just return nil (no error).
  If not nil and not t, move to limit of search and return nil.
Optional fourth argument is repeat count--search for successive occurrences.</p>
<p>
Search case-sensitivity is determined by the value of the variable
`case-fold-search', which see.</p>

Prepend OPTION to each item in ITEMS, using PREPEND-FN.</p>
<p>
Prepend OPTION to each item in ITEMS.</p>
<p>
ITEMS is a list of strings to pass to the syntax checker.  OPTION
is the option, as string.  PREPEND-FN is a function called to
prepend OPTION to each item in ITEMS.  It receives the option and
a single item from ITEMS as argument, and must return a string or
a list of strings with OPTION prepended to the item.  If
PREPEND-FN is nil or omitted, use `list'.</p>
<p>
Return a list of strings where OPTION is prepended to each item
in ITEMS using PREPEND-FN.  If PREPEND-FN returns a list, it is

<p>
Variables controlling user interaction with mode (see variable
documentation for details):
  `tcl-tab-always-indent'
    Controls action of TAB key.
  `tcl-auto-newline'
    Non-nil means automatically newline before and after braces, brackets,
    and semicolons inserted in Tcl code.
  `tcl-use-smart-word-finder'
    If not nil, use a smarter, Tcl-specific way to find the current
    word when looking up help on a Tcl command.</p>

Turning on Tcl mode runs `tcl-mode-hook'.  Read the documentation for
`tcl-mode-hook' to see what kinds of interesting hook functions
already exist.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="window--resize-this-window"></a>
<h3>Function: window--resize-this-window</h3>
Resize WINDOW vertically by DELTA lines.
Optional argument HORIZONTAL non-nil means resize WINDOW
horizontally by DELTA columns.</p>
<p>
Optional argument IGNORE non-nil means ignore restrictions
imposed by fixed size windows, `window-min-height' or
`window-min-width' settings.  If IGNORE equals `safe', live
windows may get as small as `window-safe-min-height' lines and
`window-safe-min-width' columns.  If IGNORE is a window, ignore
restrictions for that window only.  Any other non-nil value
means ignore all of the above restrictions for all windows.</p>
<p>
Optional argument ADD non-nil means add DELTA to the new total
size of WINDOW.</p>
<p>
Optional arguments TRAIL and EDGE, when non-nil, refine the set
of windows that shall be resized.  If TRAIL equals `before',
resize only windows on the left or above EDGE.  If TRAIL equals
`after', resize only windows on the right or below EDGE.  Also,
preferably only resize windows adjacent to EDGE.</p>
<p>
This function recursively resizes WINDOW's child windows to fit the
new size.  Make sure that WINDOW is `window--resizable' before
calling this function.  Note that this function does not resize
siblings of WINDOW or WINDOW's parent window.  You have to
eventually call `window-resize-apply' in order to make resizing
actually take effect.<a name="eieiomt-sym-optimize"></a>
<h3>Function: eieiomt-sym-optimize</h3>
Find the next class above S which has a function body for the optimizer.<a name="diff-goto-source"></a>
<h3>Function: diff-goto-source</h3>
Jump to the corresponding source line.
`diff-jump-to-old-file' (or its opposite if the OTHER-FILE prefix arg
is given) determines whether to jump to the old or the new file.
If the prefix arg is bigger than 8 (for example with C-u C-u)
then `diff-jump-to-old-file' is also set, for the next invocations.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: search-emacs-glossary</h3>
Display the Glossary node of the Emacs manual in Info mode.<a name="font-lock-fontify-block"></a>
<h3>Function: font-lock-fontify-block</h3>
Fontify some lines the way `font-lock-fontify-buffer' would.
The lines could be a function or paragraph, or a specified number of lines.
If ARG is given, fontify that many lines before and after point, or 16 lines if
no ARG is given and `font-lock-mark-block-function' is nil.
If `font-lock-mark-block-function' non-nil and no ARG is given, it is used to
delimit the region to fontify.<a name="indent-according-to-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: indent-according-to-mode</h3>
Indent line in proper way for current major mode.
Normally, this is done by calling the function specified by the
variable `indent-line-function'.  However, if the value of that
variable is `indent-relative' or `indent-relative-maybe', handle
it specially (since those functions are used for tabbing); in
that case, indent by aligning to the previous non-blank line.<a name="flymake-mode-off"></a>

Return value is a list of three things: number of messages sent, number of
messages skipped, and number of non-message things in the queue (commonly
backup file names and the like).</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="easy-menu-add-item"></a>
<h3>Function: easy-menu-add-item</h3>
To the submenu of MAP with path PATH, add ITEM.</p>
<p>
If an item with the same name is already present in this submenu,
then ITEM replaces it.  Otherwise, ITEM is added to this submenu.
In the latter case, ITEM is normally added at the end of the submenu.
However, if BEFORE is a string and there is an item in the submenu
with that name, then ITEM is added before that item.</p>
<p>
MAP should normally be a keymap; nil stands for the local menu-bar keymap.
It can also be a symbol, which has earlier been used as the first
argument in a call to `easy-menu-define', or the value of such a symbol.</p>
<p>
PATH is a list of strings for locating the submenu where ITEM is to be
added.  If PATH is nil, MAP itself is used.  Otherwise, the first
element should be the name of a submenu directly under MAP.  This
submenu is then traversed recursively with the remaining elements of PATH.</p>

(fn)<a name="epa-select-keys"></a>
<h3>Function: epa-select-keys</h3>
Display a user's keyring and ask him to select keys.
CONTEXT is an epg-context.
PROMPT is a string to prompt with.
NAMES is a list of strings to be matched with keys.  If it is nil, all
the keys are listed.
If SECRET is non-nil, list secret keys instead of public keys.</p>

Return non-nil if EXP will always evaluate to the same value.</p>
<p>
(fn EXP)<a name="next-single-char-property-change"></a>
<h3>Function: next-single-char-property-change</h3>
Return the position of next text property or overlay change for a specific property.
Scans characters forward from POSITION till it finds
a change in the PROP property, then returns the position of the change.
If the optional third argument OBJECT is a buffer (or nil, which means
the current buffer), POSITION is a buffer position (integer or marker).
If OBJECT is a string, POSITION is a 0-based index into it.</p>
<p>
In a string, scan runs to the end of the string.
In a buffer, it runs to (point-max), and the value cannot exceed that.</p>
<p>
The property values are compared with `eq'.
If the property is constant all the way to the end of OBJECT, return the
last valid position in OBJECT.
If the optional fourth argument LIMIT is non-nil, don't search
past position LIMIT; return LIMIT if nothing is found before LIMIT.</p>

<h3>Function: image-animate</h3>
Start animating IMAGE.
Animation occurs by destructively altering the IMAGE spec list.</p>
<p>
With optional INDEX, begin animating from that animation frame.
LIMIT specifies how long to animate the image.  If omitted or
nil, play the animation until the end.  If t, loop forever.  If a
number, play until that number of seconds has elapsed.<a name="erc-tls"></a>
<h3>Function: erc-tls</h3>
Interactively select TLS connection parameters and run ERC.
Arguments are the same as for `erc'.</p>
<p>
(fn &rest R)<a name="switch-to-prev-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: switch-to-prev-buffer</h3>
In WINDOW switch to previous buffer.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.
Return the buffer switched to, nil if no suitable buffer could be
found.</p>
<p>
Optional argument BURY-OR-KILL non-nil means the buffer currently
shown in WINDOW is about to be buried or killed and consequently
shall not be switched to in future invocations of this command.</p>
<p>
As a special case, if BURY-OR-KILL equals `append', this means to
move the buffer to the end of WINDOW's previous buffers list so a
future invocation of `switch-to-prev-buffer' less likely switches
to it.<a name="tar-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: tar-mode</h3>
Major mode for viewing a tar file as a dired-like listing of its contents.
You can move around using the usual cursor motion commands.
Letters no longer insert themselves.
Type `e' to pull a file out of the tar file and into its own buffer;
or click mouse-2 on the file's line in the Tar mode buffer.
Type `c' to copy an entry from the tar file into another file on disk.</p>
<p>
If you edit a sub-file of this archive (as with the `e' command) and
save it with C-x C-s, the contents of that buffer will be
saved back into the tar-file buffer; in this way you can edit a file
inside of a tar archive without extracting it and re-archiving it.</p>

(fn FROM TO)<a name="skip-chars-forward"></a>
<h3>Function: skip-chars-forward</h3>
Move point forward, stopping before a char not in STRING, or at pos LIM.
STRING is like the inside of a `[...]' in a regular expression
except that `]' is never special and `\' quotes `^', `-' or `\'
 (but not at the end of a range; quoting is never needed there).
Thus, with arg "a-zA-Z", this skips letters stopping before first nonletter.
With arg "^a-zA-Z", skips nonletters stopping before first letter.
Char classes, e.g. `[:alpha:]', are supported.</p>

<p>
(fn PREDICATE SEQ [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="user-variable-p"></a>
<h3>Function: user-variable-p</h3>
Return non-nil if VARIABLE is a customizable variable.
A customizable variable is either (i) a variable whose property
list contains a non-nil `standard-value' or `custom-autoload'
property, or (ii) an alias for another customizable variable.<a name="custom-declare-face"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-declare-face</h3>

<p>
(fn)<a name="seq-length"></a>
<h3>Function: seq-length</h3>
Return the length of vector, list or string SEQUENCE.
A byte-code function object is also allowed.
If the string contains multibyte characters, this is not necessarily
the number of bytes in the string; it is the number of characters.
To get the number of bytes, use `string-bytes'.</p>
<p>
(fn SEQUENCE)<a name="dir-locals-find-file"></a>
<h3>Function: dir-locals-find-file</h3>
Find the directory-local variables for FILE.
This searches upward in the directory tree from FILE.
It stops at the first directory that has been registered in
`dir-locals-directory-cache' or contains a `dir-locals-file'.
If it finds an entry in the cache, it checks that it is valid.
A cache entry with no modification time element (normally, one that
has been assigned directly using `dir-locals-set-directory-class', not
set from a file) is always valid.
A cache entry based on a `dir-locals-file' is valid if the modification
time stored in the cache matches the current file modification time.
If not, the cache entry is cleared so that the file will be re-read.</p>
<p>
This function returns either nil (no directory local variables found),
or the matching entry from `dir-locals-directory-cache' (a list),
or the full path to the `dir-locals-file' (a string) in the case
of no valid cache entry.<a name="process-name"></a>
<h3>Function: process-name</h3>

<h3>Function: winner-undo</h3>
Switch back to an earlier window configuration saved by Winner mode.
In other words, "undo" changes in window configuration.<a name="feedmail-queue-reminder"></a>
<h3>Function: feedmail-queue-reminder</h3>
Perform some kind of reminder activity about queued and draft messages.
Called with an optional symbol argument which says what kind of event
is triggering the reminder activity.  The default is 'on-demand, which
is what you typically would use if you were putting this in your Emacs start-up
or mail hook code.  Other recognized values for WHAT-EVENT (these are passed
internally by feedmail):</p>
<p>
   after-immediate      (a message has just been sent in immediate mode)
   after-queue          (a message has just been queued)
   after-draft          (a message has just been placed in the draft directory)
   after-run            (the queue has just been run, possibly sending messages)</p>
<p>
WHAT-EVENT is used as a key into the table `feedmail-queue-reminder-alist'.  If
the associated value is a function, it is called without arguments and is expected
to perform the reminder activity.  You can supply your own reminder functions
by redefining `feedmail-queue-reminder-alist'.  If you don't want any reminders,
you can set `feedmail-queue-reminder-alist' to nil.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WHAT-EVENT)<a name="facemenu-add-new-face"></a>
<h3>Function: facemenu-add-new-face</h3>
Add FACE (a face) to the Face menu if `facemenu-listed-faces' says so.
This is called whenever you create a new face, and at other times.<a name="save-some-buffers"></a>
<h3>Function: save-some-buffers</h3>
Save some modified file-visiting buffers.  Asks user about each one.
You can answer `y' to save, `n' not to save, `C-r' to look at the
buffer in question with `view-buffer' before deciding or `d' to
view the differences using `diff-buffer-with-file'.</p>
<p>
This command first saves any buffers where `buffer-save-without-query' is
non-nil, without asking.</p>
<p>
Optional argument (the prefix) non-nil means save all with no questions.
Optional second argument PRED determines which buffers are considered:
If PRED is nil, all the file-visiting buffers are considered.
If PRED is t, then certain non-file buffers will also be considered.
If PRED is a zero-argument function, it indicates for each buffer whether
to consider it or not when called with that buffer current.</p>
<p>
See `save-some-buffers-action-alist' if you want to
change the additional actions you can take on files.<a name="x-display-visual-class"></a>
<h3>Function: x-display-visual-class</h3>
Return the visual class of the X display TERMINAL.
The value is one of the symbols `static-gray', `gray-scale',
`static-color', `pseudo-color', `true-color', or `direct-color'.</p>
<p>
The optional argument TERMINAL specifies which display to ask about.
TERMINAL should a terminal object, a frame or a display name (a string).
If omitted or nil, that stands for the selected frame's display.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional TERMINAL)<a name="-partition-by-header"></a>
<h3>Function: -partition-by-header</h3>
Apply FN to the first item in LIST. That is the header
value. Apply FN to each item in LIST, splitting it each time FN

<p>
(fn FUNCTION LIST...)<a name="minibuffer-history-isearch-message"></a>
<h3>Function: minibuffer-history-isearch-message</h3>
Display the minibuffer history search prompt.
If there are no search errors, this function displays an overlay with
the isearch prompt which replaces the original minibuffer prompt.
Otherwise, it displays the standard isearch message returned from
`isearch-message'.<a name="global-linum-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: global-linum-mode</h3>
Toggle Linum mode in all buffers.
With prefix ARG, enable Global-Linum mode if ARG is positive;
otherwise, disable it.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode if
ARG is omitted or nil.</p>

<p>
(fn)<a name="copy-sequence"></a>
<h3>Function: copy-sequence</h3>
Return a copy of a list, vector, string or char-table.
The elements of a list or vector are not copied; they are shared
with the original.</p>
<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="make-local-variable"></a>
<h3>Function: make-local-variable</h3>
Make VARIABLE have a separate value in the current buffer.
Other buffers will continue to share a common default value.
(The buffer-local value of VARIABLE starts out as the same value
VARIABLE previously had.  If VARIABLE was void, it remains void.)
Return VARIABLE.</p>
<p>
If the variable is already arranged to become local when set,
this function causes a local value to exist for this buffer,
just as setting the variable would do.</p>
<p>
This function returns VARIABLE, and therefore
  (set (make-local-variable 'VARIABLE) VALUE-EXP)
works.</p>
<p>
See also `make-variable-buffer-local'.</p>
<p>
Do not use `make-local-variable' to make a hook variable buffer-local.
Instead, use `add-hook' and specify t for the LOCAL argument.</p>
<p>
(fn VARIABLE)<a name="Custom-set"></a>
<h3>Function: Custom-set</h3>
Set the current value of all edited settings in the buffer.<a name="seq-p"></a>

<h3>Function: fill-find-break-point</h3>
Move point to a proper line breaking position of the current line.
Don't move back past the buffer position LIMIT.</p>
<p>
This function is called when we are going to break the current line
after or before a non-ASCII character.  If the charset of the
character has the property `fill-find-break-point-function', this
function calls the property value as a function with one arg LIMIT.
If the charset has no such property, do nothing.<a name="fetch-bytecode"></a>
<h3>Function: fetch-bytecode</h3>
If byte-compiled OBJECT is lazy-loaded, fetch it now.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT)<a name="widget-get-sibling"></a>
<h3>Function: widget-get-sibling</h3>
Get the item WIDGET is assumed to toggle.
This is only meaningful for radio buttons or checkboxes in a list.</p>
<p>
(fn WIDGET)<a name="ispell-adjusted-window-height"></a>
<h3>Function: ispell-adjusted-window-height</h3>
Like `window-height', adjusted to correct for the effect of tall mode-lines.
The value returned is actually the nominal number of text-lines in the
window plus 1.  On a terminal, this is the same value returned by
`window-height', but if the window has a mode-line is taller than a normal
text line, the returned value may be smaller than that from
`window-height'.<a name="mm-detect-coding-region"></a>
<h3>Function: mm-detect-coding-region</h3>
Like `detect-coding-region' except returning the best one.<a name="caadar"></a>

<p>
(fn X)<a name="timer-set-time-with-usecs"></a>
<h3>Function: timer-set-time-with-usecs</h3>
Set the trigger time of TIMER to TIME plus USECS.
TIME must be in the internal format returned by, e.g., `current-time'.
The microsecond count from TIME is ignored, and USECS is used instead.
If optional fourth argument DELTA is a positive number, make the timer
fire repeatedly that many seconds apart.<a name="rst-minor-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: rst-minor-mode</h3>
Toggle ReST minor mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable ReST minor mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When ReST minor mode is enabled, the ReST mode keybindings
are installed on top of the major mode bindings.  Use this
for modes derived from Text mode, like Mail mode.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="gnus-agent-find-parameter"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-agent-find-parameter</h3>
Search for GROUPs SYMBOL in the group's parameters, the group's
topic parameters, the group's category, or the customizable

<p>
(fn GROUP SYMBOL)<a name="flycheck-report-buffer-checker-status"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-report-buffer-checker-status</h3>
In BUFFER, report a SYNTAX-CHECK STATUS with DATA.</p>
<p>
SYNTAX-CHECK is the `flycheck-syntax-check' which reported
STATUS.  STATUS denotes the status of CHECKER, with an optional
DATA.  STATUS may be one of the following symbols:</p>
<p>
`errored'
     The syntax checker has errored.  DATA is an optional error
     message.</p>
<p>
     This report finishes the current syntax check.</p>
<p>
`interrupted'
     The syntax checker was interrupted.  DATA is ignored.</p>
<p>
     This report finishes the current syntax check.</p>
<p>
`finished'
     The syntax checker has finished with a proper error report
     for the current buffer.  DATA is the (potentially empty)
     list of `flycheck-error' objects reported by the syntax
     check.</p>
<p>
     This report finishes the current syntax check.</p>
<p>
`suspicious'
     The syntax checker encountered a suspicious state, which the
     user needs to be informed about.  DATA is an optional
     message.</p>
<p>
A syntax checker _must_ report a status at least once with any
symbol that finishes the current syntax checker.  Otherwise
Flycheck gets stuck with the current syntax check.</p>
<p>
If CHECKER is not the currently used syntax checker in
`flycheck-current-syntax-check', the status report is largely
ignored.  Notably, any errors reported by the checker are
discarded.<a name="format-encode-region"></a>
<h3>Function: format-encode-region</h3>
Translate the region into some FORMAT.
FORMAT defaults to `buffer-file-format'.  It is a symbol naming
one of the formats defined in `format-alist', or a list of such symbols.<a name="widget-checkbox-action"></a>
<h3>Function: widget-checkbox-action</h3>
Toggle checkbox, notify parent, and set active state of sibling.</p>

<p>

(fn WIDGET ESCAPE)<a name="gnus-remove-if"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-remove-if</h3>
Return a copy of SEQUENCE with all items satisfying PREDICATE removed.
SEQUENCE should be a list, a vector, or a string.  Returns always a list.
If HASH-TABLE-P is non-nil, regards SEQUENCE as a hash table.<a name="find-coding-systems-for-charsets"></a>
<h3>Function: find-coding-systems-for-charsets</h3>
Return a list of proper coding systems to encode characters of CHARSETS.
CHARSETS is a list of character sets.</p>
<p>
This only finds coding systems of type `charset', whose
`:charset-list' property includes all of CHARSETS (plus `ascii' for
ASCII-compatible coding systems).  It was used in older versions of
Emacs, but is unlikely to be what you really want now.<a name="highlight-changes-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: highlight-changes-mode</h3>
Toggle highlighting changes in this buffer (Highlight Changes mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Highlight Changes mode if ARG
is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,
enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When Highlight Changes is enabled, changes are marked with a text
property.  Normally they are displayed in a distinctive face, but
command M-x highlight-changes-visible-mode can be used to toggles
this on and off.</p>
<p>
Other functions for buffers in this mode include:
M-x highlight-changes-next-change - move point to beginning of next change
M-x highlight-changes-previous-change - move to beginning of previous change
M-x highlight-changes-remove-highlight - remove the change face from the region
M-x highlight-changes-rotate-faces - rotate different "ages" of changes
through	various faces.
M-x highlight-compare-with-file - mark text as changed by comparing this
buffer with the contents of a file
M-x highlight-compare-buffers highlights differences between two buffers.</p>

ALIST is a list of conses or objects.  Each element
 (or the element's car, if it is a cons) is compared with KEY by
 calling TEST, with two arguments: (i) the element or its car,
 and (ii) KEY.
If that is non-nil, the element matches; then `assoc-default'
 returns the element's cdr, if it is a cons, or DEFAULT if the
 element is not a cons.</p>

(fn)<a name="vera-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: vera-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing Vera code.</p>
<p>
Usage:
------</p>
<p>
  INDENTATION:  Typing `TAB' at the beginning of a line indents the line.
    The amount of indentation is specified by option `vera-basic-offset'.
    Indentation can be done for an entire region (`M-C-\') or buffer (menu).
    `TAB' always indents the line if option `vera-intelligent-tab' is nil.</p>
<p>
  WORD/COMMAND COMPLETION:  Typing `TAB' after a (not completed) word looks
    for a word in the buffer or a Vera keyword that starts alike, inserts it
    and adjusts case.  Re-typing `TAB' toggles through alternative word
    completions.</p>
<p>
    Typing `TAB' after a non-word character inserts a tabulator stop (if not
    at the beginning of a line).  `M-TAB' always inserts a tabulator stop.</p>
<p>
  COMMENTS:  `C-c C-c' comments out a region if not commented out, and
    uncomments a region if already commented out.</p>
<p>
  HIGHLIGHTING (fontification):  Vera keywords, predefined types and
    constants, function names, declaration names, directives, as well as
    comments and strings are highlighted using different colors.</p>
<p>
  VERA VERSION:  OpenVera 1.4 and Vera version 6.2.8.</p>

<h3>Function: mouse-posn-property</h3>
Look for a property at click position.
POS may be either a buffer position or a click position like
those returned from `event-start'.  If the click position is on
a string, the text property PROPERTY is examined.
If this is nil or the click is not on a string, then
the corresponding buffer position is searched for PROPERTY.
If PROPERTY is encountered in one of those places,
its value is returned.</p>
<p>
(fn POS PROPERTY)<a name="url-info"></a>
<h3>Function: url-info</h3>
Fetch a GNU Info URL.</p>
<p>
(fn URL)<a name="strokes-mode"></a>

<h3>Function: dired-do-async-shell-command</h3>
Run a shell command COMMAND on the marked files asynchronously.</p>
<p>
Like `dired-do-shell-command', but adds `&' at the end of COMMAND
to execute it asynchronously.</p>
<p>
When operating on multiple files, asynchronous commands
are executed in the background on each file in parallel.
In shell syntax this means separating the individual commands
with `&'.  However, when COMMAND ends in `;' or `;&' then commands
are executed in the background on each file sequentially waiting
for each command to terminate before running the next command.
In shell syntax this means separating the individual commands with `;'.</p>
<p>
The output appears in the buffer `*Async Shell Command*'.<a name="Info-split-parameter-string"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-split-parameter-string</h3>

Before insertion, `expand-abbrev' is executed if the inserted character does
not have word syntax and the previous character in the buffer does.
After insertion, the value of `auto-fill-function' is called if the
`auto-fill-chars' table has a non-nil value for the inserted character.
At the end, it runs `post-self-insert-hook'.</p>

(fn LIM &optional STATE)<a name="dynamic-completion-table"></a>
<h3>Function: dynamic-completion-table</h3>
Use function FUN as a dynamic completion table.
FUN is called with one argument, the string for which completion is required,
and it should return an alist containing all the intended possible completions.
This alist may be a full list of possible completions so that FUN can ignore
the value of its argument.  If completion is performed in the minibuffer,
FUN will be called in the buffer from which the minibuffer was entered.</p>
<p>
The result of the `completion-table-dynamic' form is a function
that can be used as the COLLECTION argument to `try-completion' and
`all-completions'.  See Info node `(elisp)Programmed Completion'.</p>
<p>
(fn FUN)<a name="erevision"></a>
<h3>Function: erevision</h3>

<h3>Function: customize-set-value</h3>
Set VARIABLE to VALUE, and return VALUE.  VALUE is a Lisp object.</p>
<p>
If VARIABLE has a `variable-interactive' property, that is used as if
it were the arg to `interactive' (which see) to interactively read the value.</p>
<p>
If VARIABLE has a `custom-type' property, it must be a widget and the
`:prompt-value' property of that widget will be used for reading the value.</p>
<p>
If given a prefix (or a COMMENT argument), also prompt for a comment.<a name="undo-more"></a>
<h3>Function: undo-more</h3>

<h3>Function: completion-basic--pattern</h3></p>
<p>

(fn BEFOREPOINT AFTERPOINT BOUNDS)<a name="Info-split"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-split</h3>
Split an info file into an indirect file plus bounded-size subfiles.
Each subfile will be up to the number of characters that
`Info-split-threshold' specifies, plus one node.</p>
<p>
To use this command, first visit a large Info file that has a tag
table.  The buffer is modified into a (small) indirect info file which
should be saved in place of the original visited file.</p>
<p>
The subfiles are written in the same directory the original file is
in, with names generated by appending `-' and a number to the original
file name.  The indirect file still functions as an Info file, but it
contains just the tag table and a directory of subfiles.</p>

(fn)<a name="read-passwd"></a>
<h3>Function: read-passwd</h3>
Read a password, prompting with PROMPT, and return it.
If optional CONFIRM is non-nil, read the password twice to make sure.
Optional DEFAULT is a default password to use instead of empty input.</p>
<p>
This function echoes `.' for each character that the user types.</p>
<p>
Once the caller uses the password, it can erase the password
by doing (clear-string STRING).<a name="byte-compile-autoload"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-compile-autoload</h3></p>
<p>

(fn FORM)<a name="font-lock-fontify-keywords-region"></a>
<h3>Function: font-lock-fontify-keywords-region</h3>
Fontify according to `font-lock-keywords' between START and END.
START should be at the beginning of a line.
LOUDLY, if non-nil, allows progress-meter bar.<a name="completion-table-with-predicate"></a>
<h3>Function: completion-table-with-predicate</h3>
Make a completion table equivalent to TABLE but filtered through PRED1.
PRED1 is a function of one argument which returns non-nil if and only if the
argument is an element of TABLE which should be considered for completion.
STRING, PRED2, and ACTION are the usual arguments to completion tables,
as described in `try-completion', `all-completions', and `test-completion'.
If STRICT is t, the predicate always applies; if nil it only applies if
it does not reduce the set of possible completions to nothing.
Note: TABLE needs to be a proper completion table which obeys predicates.</p>
<p>
(fn TABLE PRED1 STRICT STRING PRED2 ACTION)<a name="calendar"></a>
<h3>Function: calendar</h3>
Display a three-month Gregorian calendar.
The three months appear side by side, with the current month in
the middle surrounded by the previous and next months.  The
cursor is put on today's date.  If optional prefix argument ARG
is non-nil, prompts for the central month and year.</p>
<p>
Once in the calendar window, future or past months can be moved
into view.  Arbitrary months can be displayed, or the calendar
can be scrolled forward or backward.  The cursor can be moved
forward or backward by one day, one week, one month, or one year.
All of these commands take prefix arguments which, when negative,
cause movement in the opposite direction.  For convenience, the
digit keys and the minus sign are automatically prefixes.  Use
C-h m for details of the key bindings in the calendar
window.</p>
<p>
Displays the calendar in a separate window, or optionally in a
separate frame, depending on the value of `calendar-setup'.</p>
<p>
If `calendar-view-diary-initially-flag' is non-nil, also displays the
diary entries for the current date (or however many days
`diary-number-of-entries' specifies).  This variable can be
overridden by `calendar-setup'.  As well as being displayed,
diary entries can also be marked on the calendar (see
`calendar-mark-diary-entries-flag').</p>
<p>
Runs the following hooks:</p>
<p>
`calendar-load-hook' - after loading calendar.el
`calendar-today-visible-hook', `calendar-today-invisible-hook' - after
   generating a calendar, if today's date is visible or not, respectively
`calendar-initial-window-hook' - after first creating a calendar</p>
<p>
This function is suitable for execution in an init file.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="custom-initialize-delay"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-initialize-delay</h3>
Delay initialization of SYMBOL to the next Emacs start.
This is used in files that are preloaded (or for autoloaded
variables), so that the initialization is done in the run-time
context rather than the build-time context.  This also has the
side-effect that the (delayed) initialization is performed with
the :set function.</p>
<p>
For variables in preloaded files, you can simply use this
function for the :initialize property.  For autoloaded variables,
you will also need to add an autoload stanza calling this
function, and another one setting the standard-value property.
Or you can wrap the defcustom in a progn, to force the autoloader
to include all of it.<a name="gnus-and"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-and</h3>
Return non-nil if all of the elements are non-nil.<a name="timer--time-less-p"></a>
<h3>Function: timer--time-less-p</h3>

<h3>Function: wordstar-mode</h3>
Major mode with WordStar-like key bindings.</p>
<p>
BUGS:
 - Help menus with WordStar commands (C-j just calls help-for-help)
   are not implemented
 - Options for search and replace
 - Show markers (C-k h) is somewhat strange
 - Search and replace (C-q a) is only available in forward direction</p>

(fn)<a name="pr-ps-region-print"></a>
<h3>Function: pr-ps-region-print</h3>
Print region using PostScript printer.</p>
<p>
See also `pr-ps-buffer-print'.</p>
<p>
(fn N-UP &optional FILENAME)<a name="locate"></a>
<h3>Function: locate</h3>
Run the program `locate', putting results in `*Locate*' buffer.
Pass it SEARCH-STRING as argument.  Interactively, prompt for SEARCH-STRING.
With prefix arg ARG, prompt for the exact shell command to run instead.</p>
<p>
This program searches for those file names in a database that match
SEARCH-STRING and normally outputs all matching absolute file names,
one per line.  The database normally consists of all files on your
system, or of all files that you have access to.  Consult the
documentation of the program for the details about how it determines
which file names match SEARCH-STRING.  (Those details vary highly with
the version.)</p>
<p>
You can specify another program for this command to run by customizing
the variables `locate-command' or `locate-make-command-line'.</p>
<p>
The main use of FILTER is to implement `locate-with-filter'.  See
the docstring of that function for its meaning.</p>
<p>
After preparing the results buffer, this runs `dired-mode-hook' and
then `locate-post-command-hook'.</p>
<p>
(fn SEARCH-STRING &optional FILTER ARG)<a name="switch-to-buffer-other-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: switch-to-buffer-other-frame</h3>
Switch to buffer BUFFER-OR-NAME in another frame.
BUFFER-OR-NAME may be a buffer, a string (a buffer name), or
nil.  Return the buffer switched to.</p>
<p>
If called interactively, prompt for the buffer name using the
minibuffer.  The variable `confirm-nonexistent-file-or-buffer'
determines whether to request confirmation before creating a new
buffer.</p>
<p>
If BUFFER-OR-NAME is a string and does not identify an existing
buffer, create a new buffer with that name.  If BUFFER-OR-NAME is
nil, switch to the buffer returned by `other-buffer'.</p>
<p>
Optional second arg NORECORD non-nil means do not put this
buffer at the front of the list of recently selected ones.</p>
<p>
This uses the function `display-buffer' as a subroutine; see its
documentation for additional customization information.<a name="new-fontset"></a>
<h3>Function: new-fontset</h3>
Create a new fontset NAME from font information in FONTLIST.</p>
<p>
FONTLIST is an alist of scripts vs the corresponding font specification list.
Each element of FONTLIST has the form (SCRIPT FONT-SPEC ...), where a
character of SCRIPT is displayed by a font that matches one of
FONT-SPEC.</p>
<p>
SCRIPT is a symbol that appears in the first extra slot of the
char-table `char-script-table'.</p>
<p>
FONT-SPEC is a vector, a cons, or a string.  See the documentation of
`set-fontset-font' for the meaning.</p>
<p>
(fn NAME FONTLIST)<a name="encode-big5-char"></a>
<h3>Function: encode-big5-char</h3>
Encode the Big5 character CH to BIG5 coding system.
Return the corresponding character code in Big5.</p>
<p>
(fn CH)<a name="kmacro-pop-ring"></a>

Translate the `(message)' FORM into a regular expression.<a name="ert--set-difference"></a>
<h3>Function: ert--set-difference</h3>
A reimplementation of `set-difference'.  Subtract the set B from the set A.</p>
<p>
Elements are compared using `eql'.<a name="destructor"></a>
<h3>Function: destructor</h3>
Destructor for cleaning up any dynamic links to our object.<a name="sql-ms"></a>
<h3>Function: sql-ms</h3>
Run osql by Microsoft as an inferior process.</p>
<p>
If buffer `*SQL*' exists but no process is running, make a new process.
If buffer exists and a process is running, just switch to buffer
`*SQL*'.</p>
<p>
Interpreter used comes from variable `sql-ms-program'.  Login uses the
variables `sql-user', `sql-password', `sql-database', and `sql-server'
as defaults, if set.  Additional command line parameters can be stored
in the list `sql-ms-options'.</p>
<p>
The buffer is put in SQL interactive mode, giving commands for sending
input.  See `sql-interactive-mode'.</p>
<p>
To set the buffer name directly, use C-u
before M-x sql-ms.  Once session has started,
M-x sql-rename-buffer can be called separately to rename the
buffer.</p>
<p>
To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the input and output to the process, use C-x RET c
before M-x sql-ms.  You can also specify this with C-x RET p
in the SQL buffer, after you start the process.
The default comes from `process-coding-system-alist' and
`default-process-coding-system'.</p>
<p>
(Type C-h m in the SQL buffer for a list of commands.)</p>
<p>
(fn &optional BUFFER)<a name="auto-image-file-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: auto-image-file-mode</h3>
Toggle visiting of image files as images (Auto Image File mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Auto Image File mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
An image file is one whose name has an extension in
`image-file-name-extensions', or matches a regexp in
`image-file-name-regexps'.</p>

(fn &optional ARG)<a name="goto-address"></a>
<h3>Function: goto-address</h3>
Sets up goto-address functionality in the current buffer.
Allows user to use mouse/keyboard command to click to go to a URL
or to send e-mail.
By default, goto-address binds `goto-address-at-point' to mouse-2 and C-c RET
only on URLs and e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>
Also fontifies the buffer appropriately (see `goto-address-fontify-p' and
`goto-address-highlight-p' for more information).</p>

of the key sequence that ran this command.<a name="prompt-for-change-log-name"></a>
<h3>Function: prompt-for-change-log-name</h3>
Prompt for a change log name.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="composition-get-gstring"></a>
<h3>Function: composition-get-gstring</h3>
Return a glyph-string for characters between FROM and TO.
If the glyph string is for graphic display, FONT-OBJECT must be
a font-object to use for those characters.
Otherwise (for terminal display), FONT-OBJECT must be a terminal ID, a
frame, or nil for the selected frame's terminal device.</p>
<p>
If the optional 4th argument STRING is not nil, it is a string
containing the target characters between indices FROM and TO.</p>
<p>
A glyph-string is a vector containing information about how to display
a specific character sequence.  The format is:
   [HEADER ID GLYPH ...]</p>
<p>
HEADER is a vector of this form:
    [FONT-OBJECT CHAR ...]
where
    FONT-OBJECT is a font-object for all glyphs in the glyph-string,
    or the terminal coding system of the specified terminal.
    CHARs are characters to be composed by GLYPHs.</p>
<p>
ID is an identification number of the glyph-string.  It may be nil if
not yet shaped.</p>
<p>
GLYPH is a vector whose elements have this form:
    [ FROM-IDX TO-IDX C CODE WIDTH LBEARING RBEARING ASCENT DESCENT
      [ [X-OFF Y-OFF WADJUST] | nil] ]
where
    FROM-IDX and TO-IDX are used internally and should not be touched.
    C is the character of the glyph.
    CODE is the glyph-code of C in FONT-OBJECT.
    WIDTH thru DESCENT are the metrics (in pixels) of the glyph.
    X-OFF and Y-OFF are offsets to the base position for the glyph.
    WADJUST is the adjustment to the normal width of the glyph.</p>
<p>
If GLYPH is nil, the remaining elements of the glyph-string vector
should be ignored.</p>

<p>
(fn &optional TO SUBJECT)<a name="dir-locals-set-class-variables"></a>
<h3>Function: dir-locals-set-class-variables</h3>
Map the type CLASS to a list of variable settings.
CLASS is the project class, a symbol.  VARIABLES is a list
that declares directory-local variables for the class.
An element in VARIABLES is either of the form:
    (MAJOR-MODE . ALIST)
or
    (DIRECTORY . LIST)</p>
<p>
In the first form, MAJOR-MODE is a symbol, and ALIST is an alist
whose elements are of the form (VARIABLE . VALUE).</p>
<p>
In the second form, DIRECTORY is a directory name (a string), and
LIST is a list of the form accepted by the function.</p>
<p>
When a file is visited, the file's class is found.  A directory
may be assigned a class using `dir-locals-set-directory-class'.
Then variables are set in the file's buffer according to the
VARIABLES list of the class.  The list is processed in order.</p>
<p>
* If the element is of the form (MAJOR-MODE . ALIST), and the
  buffer's major mode is derived from MAJOR-MODE (as determined
  by `derived-mode-p'), then all the variables in ALIST are
  applied.  A MAJOR-MODE of nil may be used to match any buffer.
  `make-local-variable' is called for each variable before it is
  set.</p>
<p>
* If the element is of the form (DIRECTORY . LIST), and DIRECTORY
  is an initial substring of the file's directory, then LIST is
  applied by recursively following these rules.<a name="flycheck-previous-error"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-previous-error</h3>
Visit the N-th previous error.</p>
<p>
If given, N specifies the number of errors to move backwards by.
If N is negative, move forwards instead.<a name="gnus-globalify-regexp"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-globalify-regexp</h3>
Return a regexp that matches a whole line, if RE matches a part of it.<a name="batch-unrmail"></a>
<h3>Function: batch-unrmail</h3>
Convert old-style Rmail Babyl files to system inbox format.
Specify the input Rmail Babyl file names as command line arguments.
For each Rmail file, the corresponding output file name
is made by adding `.mail' at the end.
For example, invoke `emacs -batch -f batch-unrmail RMAIL'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="gnus-registry-install-hooks"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-registry-install-hooks</h3>

<p>
(fn)<a name="byte-compile-file"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-compile-file</h3>
Compile a file of Lisp code named FILENAME into a file of byte code.
The output file's name is generated by passing FILENAME to the
function `byte-compile-dest-file' (which see).
With prefix arg (noninteractively: 2nd arg), LOAD the file after compiling.
The value is non-nil if there were no errors, nil if errors.</p>
<p>
(fn FILENAME &optional LOAD)<a name="add-hook"></a>
<h3>Function: add-hook</h3>
Add to the value of HOOK the function FUNCTION.
FUNCTION is not added if already present.
FUNCTION is added (if necessary) at the beginning of the hook list
unless the optional argument APPEND is non-nil, in which case
FUNCTION is added at the end.</p>
<p>
The optional fourth argument, LOCAL, if non-nil, says to modify
the hook's buffer-local value rather than its global value.
This makes the hook buffer-local, and it makes t a member of the
buffer-local value.  That acts as a flag to run the hook
functions of the global value as well as in the local value.</p>
<p>
HOOK should be a symbol, and FUNCTION may be any valid function.  If
HOOK is void, it is first set to nil.  If HOOK's value is a single
function, it is changed to a list of functions.<a name="fillarray"></a>
<h3>Function: fillarray</h3>

Return a pair of lists giving all the overlays of the current buffer.
The car has all the overlays before the overlay center;
the cdr has all the overlays after the overlay center.
Recentering overlays moves overlays between these lists.
The lists you get are copies, so that changing them has no effect.
However, the overlays you get are the real objects that the buffer uses.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="xselect--selection-bounds"></a>
<h3>Function: xselect--selection-bounds</h3>
Return bounds of X selection value VALUE.
The return value is a list (BEG END BUF) if VALUE is a cons of
two markers or an overlay.  Otherwise, it is nil.<a name="sql-linter"></a>
<h3>Function: sql-linter</h3>
Run inl by RELEX as an inferior process.</p>
<p>
If buffer `*SQL*' exists but no process is running, make a new process.
If buffer exists and a process is running, just switch to buffer
`*SQL*'.</p>
<p>
Interpreter used comes from variable `sql-linter-program' - usually `inl'.
Login uses the variables `sql-user', `sql-password', `sql-database' and
`sql-server' as defaults, if set.  Additional command line parameters
can be stored in the list `sql-linter-options'.  Run inl -h to get help on
parameters.</p>
<p>
`sql-database' is used to set the LINTER_MBX environment variable for
local connections, `sql-server' refers to the server name from the
`nodetab' file for the network connection (dbc_tcp or friends must run
for this to work).  If `sql-password' is an empty string, inl will use
an empty password.</p>
<p>
The buffer is put in SQL interactive mode, giving commands for sending
input.  See `sql-interactive-mode'.</p>
<p>
To set the buffer name directly, use C-u
before M-x sql-linter.  Once session has started,
M-x sql-rename-buffer can be called separately to rename the
buffer.</p>
<p>
(Type C-h m in the SQL buffer for a list of commands.)</p>

<h3>Function: erc-delete-pal</h3>
Delete pal interactively to `erc-pals'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="kill-region"></a>
<h3>Function: kill-region</h3>
Kill ("cut") text between point and mark.
This deletes the text from the buffer and saves it in the kill ring.
The command C-y can retrieve it from there.
(If you want to save the region without killing it, use M-w.)</p>
<p>
If you want to append the killed region to the last killed text,
use C-M-w before C-w.</p>
<p>
If the buffer is read-only, Emacs will beep and refrain from deleting
the text, but put the text in the kill ring anyway.  This means that
you can use the killing commands to copy text from a read-only buffer.</p>
<p>
Lisp programs should use this function for killing text.
 (To delete text, use `delete-region'.)
Supply two arguments, character positions indicating the stretch of text
 to be killed.
Any command that calls this function is a "kill command".
If the previous command was also a kill command,
the text killed this time appends to the text killed last time
to make one entry in the kill ring.<a name="rfc2047-pad-base64"></a>
<h3>Function: rfc2047-pad-base64</h3>

<p>
(fn &optional SERVER)<a name="redirect-frame-focus"></a>
<h3>Function: redirect-frame-focus</h3>
Arrange for keystrokes typed at FRAME to be sent to FOCUS-FRAME.
In other words, switch-frame events caused by events in FRAME will
request a switch to FOCUS-FRAME, and `last-event-frame' will be
FOCUS-FRAME after reading an event typed at FRAME.</p>
<p>
If FOCUS-FRAME is nil, any existing redirection is canceled, and the
frame again receives its own keystrokes.</p>
<p>
Focus redirection is useful for temporarily redirecting keystrokes to
a surrogate minibuffer frame when a frame doesn't have its own
minibuffer window.</p>
<p>
A frame's focus redirection can be changed by `select-frame'.  If frame
FOO is selected, and then a different frame BAR is selected, any
frames redirecting their focus to FOO are shifted to redirect their
focus to BAR.  This allows focus redirection to work properly when the
user switches from one frame to another using `select-window'.</p>
<p>
This means that a frame whose focus is redirected to itself is treated
differently from a frame whose focus is redirected to nil; the former
is affected by `select-frame', while the latter is not.</p>
<p>
The redirection lasts until `redirect-frame-focus' is called to change it.</p>
<p>

`A':   Accept word and place in `buffer-local dictionary'.
`r':   Replace word with typed-in value.  Rechecked.
`R':   Replace word with typed-in value.  Query-replaced in buffer.  Rechecked.
`?':   Show these commands.
`x':   Exit spelling buffer.  Move cursor to original point.
`X':   Exit spelling buffer.  Leaves cursor at the current point, and permits
        the aborted check to be completed later.
`q':   Quit spelling session (Kills ispell process).
`l':   Look up typed-in replacement in alternate dictionary.  Wildcards okay.

<h3>Function: epa-verify-region</h3>
Verify the current region between START and END.</p>
<p>
Don't use this command in Lisp programs!
Since this function operates on regions, it does some tricks such
as coding-system detection and unibyte/multibyte conversion.  If
you are sure how the data in the region should be treated, you
should consider using the string based counterpart
`epg-verify-string', or the file based counterpart
`epg-verify-file' instead.</p>
<p>
For example:</p>
<p>
(let ((context (epg-make-context 'OpenPGP)))
  (decode-coding-string
    (epg-verify-string context (buffer-substring start end))
    'utf-8))</p>
<p>

<p>
(fn)<a name="warn"></a>
<h3>Function: warn</h3>
Display a warning message made from (format MESSAGE ARGS...).
Aside from generating the message with `format',
this is equivalent to `display-warning', using
`emacs' as the type and `:warning' as the level.<a name="file-name-shadow-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: file-name-shadow-mode</h3>
Toggle file-name shadowing in minibuffers (File-Name Shadow mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable File-Name Shadow mode if ARG
is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,
enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
File-Name Shadow mode is a global minor mode.  When enabled, any
part of a filename being read in the minibuffer that would be
ignored (because the result is passed through
`substitute-in-file-name') is given the properties in
`file-name-shadow-properties', which can be used to make that
portion dim, invisible, or otherwise less visually noticeable.<a name="quail-defrule"></a>
<h3>Function: quail-defrule</h3>
Add one translation rule, KEY to TRANSLATION, in the current Quail package.
KEY is a string meaning a sequence of keystrokes to be translated.
TRANSLATION is a character, a string, a vector, a Quail map,
 a function, or a cons.
It it is a character, it is the sole translation of KEY.
If it is a string, each character is a candidate for the translation.
If it is a vector, each element (string or character) is a candidate
 for the translation.
If it is a cons, the car is one of the above and the cdr is a function
 to call when translating KEY (the return value is assigned to the
 variable `quail-current-data').  If the cdr part is not a function,
 the value itself is assigned to `quail-current-data'.
In these cases, a key specific Quail map is generated and assigned to KEY.</p>
<p>
If TRANSLATION is a Quail map or a function symbol which returns a Quail map,
 it is used to handle KEY.</p>
<p>
Optional 3rd argument NAME, if specified, says which Quail package
to define this translation rule in.  The default is to define it in the
current Quail package.</p>
<p>
Optional 4th argument APPEND, if non-nil, appends TRANSLATION
to the current translations for KEY instead of replacing them.</p>
<p>

Move the mouse pointer to pixel position (X,Y) in FRAME.
The position is given in pixels, where (0, 0) is the upper-left corner
of the frame, X is the horizontal offset, and Y is the vertical offset.</p>
<p>
Note, this is a no-op for an X frame that is not visible.
If you have just created a frame, you must wait for it to become visible
before calling this function on it, like this.

<h3>Function: fill-region-as-paragraph</h3>
Fill the region as one paragraph.
It removes any paragraph breaks in the region and extra newlines at the end,
indents and fills lines between the margins given by the
`current-left-margin' and `current-fill-column' functions.
(In most cases, the variable `fill-column' controls the width.)
It leaves point at the beginning of the line following the paragraph.</p>
<p>
Normally performs justification according to the `current-justification'
function, but with a prefix arg, does full justification instead.</p>
<p>
From a program, optional third arg JUSTIFY can specify any type of
justification.  Fourth arg NOSQUEEZE non-nil means not to make spaces
between words canonical before filling.  Fifth arg SQUEEZE-AFTER, if non-nil,
means don't canonicalize spaces before that position.</p>
<p>
Return the `fill-prefix' used for filling.</p>
<p>

space does not end a sentence, so don't break a line there.<a name="tabify"></a>
<h3>Function: tabify</h3>
Convert multiple spaces in region to tabs when possible.
A group of spaces is partially replaced by tabs
when this can be done without changing the column they end at.

<h3>Function: smiley-buffer</h3>
Run `smiley-region' at the BUFFER, specified in the argument or
interactively.  If there's no argument, do it at the current buffer.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional BUFFER)<a name="gmm-message"></a>
<h3>Function: gmm-message</h3>
If LEVEL is lower than `gmm-verbose' print ARGS using `message'.</p>
<p>
Guideline for numbers:
1 - error messages
3 - non-serious error messages
5 - messages for things that take a long time
7 - not very important messages on stuff
9 - messages inside loops.</p>
<p>
(fn LEVEL &rest ARGS)<a name="comint-redirect-results-list"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-redirect-results-list</h3>
Send COMMAND to current process.
Return a list of expressions in the output which match REGEXP.
REGEXP-GROUP is the regular expression group in REGEXP to use.</p>
<p>
(fn COMMAND REGEXP REGEXP-GROUP)<a name="seq-do"></a>
<h3>Function: seq-do</h3>
Apply FUNCTION to each element of SEQUENCE for side effects only.
Unlike `mapcar', don't accumulate the results.  Return SEQUENCE.
SEQUENCE may be a list, a vector, a bool-vector, or a string.</p>
<p>
(fn FUNCTION SEQUENCE)<a name="describe-package"></a>
<h3>Function: describe-package</h3>
Display the full documentation of PACKAGE (a symbol).<a name="unhandled-file-name-directory"></a>
<h3>Function: unhandled-file-name-directory</h3>
Return a directly usable directory name somehow associated with FILENAME.
A `directly usable' directory name is one that may be used without the
intervention of any file handler.
If FILENAME is a directly usable file itself, return
(file-name-directory FILENAME).
If FILENAME refers to a file which is not accessible from a local process,
then this should return nil.
The `call-process' and `start-process' functions use this function to
get a current directory to run processes in.</p>
<p>
(fn FILENAME)<a name="ispell-minor-check"></a>
<h3>Function: ispell-minor-check</h3>
Check previous word, then continue with the normal binding of this key.
Don't check previous word when character before point is a space or newline.
Don't read buffer-local settings or word lists.<a name="forward-symbol"></a>
<h3>Function: forward-symbol</h3>
Move point to the next position that is the end of a symbol.
A symbol is any sequence of characters that are in either the
word constituent or symbol constituent syntax class.
With prefix argument ARG, do it ARG times if positive, or move
backwards ARG times if negative.<a name="dash--match-kv"></a>
<h3>Function: dash--match-kv</h3>
Setup a kv matching environment and call the real matcher.</p>
<p>
kv can be any key-value store, such as plist, alist or hash-table.</p>
<p>
(fn MATCH-FORM SOURCE)<a name="server-ensure-safe-dir"></a>
<h3>Function: server-ensure-safe-dir</h3>
Make sure DIR is a directory with no race-condition issues.
Creates the directory if necessary and makes sure:
- there's no symlink involved
- it's owned by us
- it's not readable/writable by anybody else.</p>
<p>
(fn DIR)<a name="vc-git-extra-status-menu"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-git-extra-status-menu</h3></p>
<p>

(fn)<a name="isqrt"></a>
<h3>Function: isqrt</h3>
Return the integer square root of the argument.</p>
<p>
(fn X)<a name="frame-remove-geometry-params"></a>
<h3>Function: frame-remove-geometry-params</h3>
Return the parameter list PARAM-LIST, but with geometry specs removed.
This deletes all bindings in PARAM-LIST for `top', `left', `width',
`height', `user-size' and `user-position' parameters.
Emacs uses this to avoid overriding explicit moves and resizings from
the user during startup.<a name="gnus-fetch-original-field"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-fetch-original-field</h3>
Fetch FIELD from the original version of the current article.<a name="mm-string-as-multibyte"></a>
<h3>Function: mm-string-as-multibyte</h3>
Return a multibyte string with the same individual bytes as STRING.
If STRING is multibyte, the result is STRING itself.
Otherwise it is a newly created string, with no text properties.</p>
<p>
If STRING is unibyte and contains an individual 8-bit byte (i.e. not
part of a correct utf-8 sequence), it is converted to the corresponding
multibyte character of charset `eight-bit'.
See also `string-to-multibyte'.</p>
<p>
Beware, this often doesn't really do what you think it does.
It is similar to (decode-coding-string STRING 'utf-8-emacs).
If you're not sure, whether to use `string-as-multibyte' or
`string-to-multibyte', use `string-to-multibyte'.</p>
<p>
(fn STRING)<a name="word-search-backward"></a>
<h3>Function: word-search-backward</h3>
Search backward from point for STRING, ignoring differences in punctuation.
Set point to the beginning of the occurrence found, and return point.
An optional second argument bounds the search; it is a buffer position.
The match found must not extend before that position.
Optional third argument, if t, means if fail just return nil (no error).
  If not nil and not t, move to limit of search and return nil.
Optional fourth argument is repeat count--search for successive occurrences.</p>
<p>
Relies on the function `word-search-regexp' to convert a sequence
of words in STRING to a regexp used to search words without regard
to punctuation.<a name="completion-pcm--merge-completions"></a>
<h3>Function: completion-pcm--merge-completions</h3>
Extract the commonality in STRS, with the help of PATTERN.
PATTERN can contain strings and symbols chosen among `star', `any', `point',
and `prefix'.  They all match anything (aka ".*") but are merged differently:
`any' only grows from the left (when matching "a1b" and "a2b" it gets
  completed to just "a").
`prefix' only grows from the right (when matching "a1b" and "a2b" it gets
  completed to just "b").
`star' grows from both ends and is reified into a "*"  (when matching "a1b"
  and "a2b" it gets completed to "a*b").
`point' is like `star' except that it gets reified as the position of point
  instead of being reified as a "*" character.
The underlying idea is that we should return a string which still matches
the same set of elements.</p>
<p>
(fn STRS PATTERN)<a name="texinfo-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: texinfo-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing Texinfo files.</p>
<p>
  It has these extra commands:</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `texinfo-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

  These are files that are used as input for TeX to make printed manuals
and also to be turned into Info files with M-x makeinfo-buffer or
the `makeinfo' program.  These files must be written in a very restricted and
modified version of TeX input format.</p>
<p>
  Editing commands are like text-mode except that the syntax table is
set up so expression commands skip Texinfo bracket groups.  To see
what the Info version of a region of the Texinfo file will look like,
use M-x makeinfo-region, which runs `makeinfo' on the current region.</p>
<p>
  You can show the structure of a Texinfo file with M-x texinfo-show-structure.
This command shows the structure of a Texinfo file by listing the
lines with the @-sign commands for @chapter, @section, and the like.
These lines are displayed in another window called the *Occur* window.
In that window, you can position the cursor over one of the lines and
use M-x occur-mode-goto-occurrence, to jump to the corresponding spot
in the Texinfo file.</p>
<p>
  In addition, Texinfo mode provides commands that insert various
frequently used @-sign commands into the buffer.  You can use these
commands to save keystrokes.  And you can insert balanced braces with
M-x texinfo-insert-braces and later use the command M-x up-list to
move forward past the closing brace.</p>
<p>
Also, Texinfo mode provides functions for automatically creating or
updating menus and node pointers.  These functions</p>
<p>
  * insert the `Next', `Previous' and `Up' pointers of a node,
  * insert or update the menu for a section, and
  * create a master menu for a Texinfo source file.</p>
<p>
Here are the functions:</p>
<p>
    texinfo-update-node                M-x texinfo-update-node
    texinfo-every-node-update          M-x texinfo-every-node-update
    texinfo-sequential-node-update</p>
<p>
    texinfo-make-menu                  M-x texinfo-make-menu
    texinfo-all-menus-update           M-x texinfo-all-menus-update
    texinfo-master-menu</p>
<p>
    texinfo-indent-menu-description (column &optional region-p)</p>
<p>
The `texinfo-column-for-description' variable specifies the column to
which menu descriptions are indented.</p>
<p>
Passed an argument (a prefix argument, if interactive), the
`texinfo-update-node' and `texinfo-make-menu' functions do their jobs
in the region.</p>
<p>
To use the updating commands, you must structure your Texinfo file
hierarchically, such that each `@node' line, with the exception of the
Top node, is accompanied by some kind of section line, such as an
`@chapter' or `@section' line.</p>
<p>
If the file has a `top' node, it must be called `top' or `Top' and
be the first node in the file.</p>
<p>
Entering Texinfo mode calls the value of `text-mode-hook', and then the
value of `texinfo-mode-hook'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="copy-rectangle-to-register"></a>
<h3>Function: copy-rectangle-to-register</h3>
Copy rectangular region into register REGISTER.
With prefix arg, delete as well.
To insert this register in the buffer, use C-x r g.</p>
<p>
Called from a program, takes four args: REGISTER, START, END and DELETE-FLAG.
START and END are buffer positions giving two corners of rectangle.<a name="flycheck-add-next-checker"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-add-next-checker</h3>
After CHECKER add a NEXT checker.</p>
<p>
CHECKER is a syntax checker symbol, to which to add NEXT checker.</p>
<p>
NEXT is a cons cell `(LEVEL . NEXT-CHECKER)'.  NEXT-CHECKER is a
symbol denoting the syntax checker to run after CHECKER.  LEVEL
is an error level.  NEXT-CHECKER will only be used if there is no
current error whose level is more severe than LEVEL.  LEVEL may
also be t, in which case NEXT-CHECKER is used regardless of the
current errors.</p>
<p>
NEXT can also be a syntax checker symbol only, which is
equivalent to `(t . NEXT)'.</p>
<p>
NEXT-CHECKER is prepended before other next checkers, unless
APPEND is non-nil.<a name="dired-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-mode</h3>
Mode for "editing" directory listings.
In Dired, you are "editing" a list of the files in a directory and
  (optionally) its subdirectories, in the format of `ls -lR'.
  Each directory is a page: use C-x [ and C-x ] to move pagewise.
"Editing" means that you can run shell commands on files, visit,
  compress, load or byte-compile them, change their file attributes
  and insert subdirectories into the same buffer.  You can "mark"
  files for later commands or "flag" them for deletion, either file
  by file or all files matching certain criteria.
You can move using the usual cursor motion commands.
The buffer is read-only.  Digits are prefix arguments.
Type d to flag a file `D' for deletion.
Type m to Mark a file or subdirectory for later commands.
  Most commands operate on the marked files and use the current file
  if no files are marked.  Use a numeric prefix argument to operate on
  the next ARG (or previous -ARG if ARG<0) files, or just `1'
  to operate on the current file only.  Prefix arguments override marks.
  Mark-using commands display a list of failures afterwards.  Type ?
  to see why something went wrong.
Type u to Unmark a file or all files of an inserted subdirectory.
Type DEL to back up one line and unmark or unflag.
Type x to delete (eXecute) the files flagged `D'.
Type RET to Find the current line's file
  (or dired it in another buffer, if it is a directory).
Type o to find file or dired directory in Other window.
Type i to Insert a subdirectory in this buffer.
Type R to Rename a file or move the marked files to another directory.
Type C to Copy files.
Type s to toggle Sorting by name/date or change the `ls' switches.
Type g to read all currently expanded directories aGain.
  This retains all marks and hides subdirs again that were hidden before.
Use `SPC' and `DEL' to move down and up by lines.</p>
<p>
If Dired ever gets confused, you can either type g to read the
directories again, type l to relist the file at point or the marked files or a
subdirectory, or type M-x dired-build-subdir-alist to parse the buffer
again for the directory tree.</p>
<p>

(fn POS &optional EVENT)<a name="rfc2047-decode-string"></a>
<h3>Function: rfc2047-decode-string</h3>
Decode MIME-encoded STRING and return the result.
If ADDRESS-MIME is non-nil, strip backslashes which precede characters
other than `"' and `\' in quoted strings.<a name="Info-menu"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-menu</h3>
Go to the node pointed to by the menu item named (or abbreviated) MENU-ITEM.
The menu item should one of those listed in the current node's menu.
Completion is allowed, and the default menu item is the one point is on.
If FORK is non-nil (interactively with a prefix arg), show the node in
a new Info buffer.  If FORK is a string, it is the name to use for the
new buffer.<a name="copy-face"></a>
<h3>Function: copy-face</h3>
Define a face named NEW-FACE, which is a copy of OLD-FACE.
This function does not copy face customization data, so NEW-FACE
will not be made customizable.  Most Lisp code should not call
this function; use `defface' with :inherit instead.</p>
<p>
If NEW-FACE already exists as a face, modify it to be like
OLD-FACE.  If NEW-FACE doesn't already exist, create it.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument FRAME is a frame, change NEW-FACE on
FRAME only.  If FRAME is t, copy the frame-independent default
specification for OLD-FACE to NEW-FACE.  If FRAME is nil, copy
the defaults as well as the faces on each existing frame.</p>
<p>
If the optional fourth argument NEW-FRAME is given, copy the
information from face OLD-FACE on frame FRAME to NEW-FACE on
frame NEW-FRAME.  In this case, FRAME must not be nil.<a name="auth-source-forget-all-cached"></a>
<h3>Function: auth-source-forget-all-cached</h3>

<h3>Function: url-rlogin</h3></p>
<p>

(fn URL)<a name="ebnf-print-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: ebnf-print-buffer</h3>
Generate and print a PostScript syntactic chart image of the buffer.</p>
<p>
When called with a numeric prefix argument (C-u), prompts the user for
the name of a file to save the PostScript image in, instead of sending
it to the printer.</p>
<p>
More specifically, the FILENAME argument is treated as follows: if it
is nil, send the image to the printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save
the PostScript image in a file with that name.  If FILENAME is a
number, prompt the user for the name of the file to save in.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FILENAME)<a name="calc-embedded-activate"></a>

<h3>Function: browse-url-w3</h3>
Ask the w3 WWW browser to load URL.
Default to the URL around or before point.</p>
<p>
When called interactively, if variable `browse-url-new-window-flag' is
non-nil, load the document in a new window.  A non-nil interactive
prefix argument reverses the effect of `browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
When called non-interactively, optional second argument NEW-WINDOW is
used instead of `browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
(fn URL &optional NEW-WINDOW)<a name="keyboard-escape-quit"></a>
<h3>Function: keyboard-escape-quit</h3>
Exit the current "mode" (in a generalized sense of the word).
This command can exit an interactive command such as `query-replace',
can clear out a prefix argument or a region,
can get out of the minibuffer or other recursive edit,
cancel the use of the current buffer (for special-purpose buffers),
or go back to just one window (by deleting all but the selected window).<a name="read-no-blanks-input"></a>
<h3>Function: read-no-blanks-input</h3>
Read a string from the terminal, not allowing blanks.
Prompt with PROMPT.  Whitespace terminates the input.  If INITIAL is
non-nil, it should be a string, which is used as initial input, with
point positioned at the end, so that SPACE will accept the input.
(Actually, INITIAL can also be a cons of a string and an integer.
Such values are treated as in `read-from-minibuffer', but are normally
not useful in this function.)
Third arg INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD, if non-nil, means the minibuffer inherits
the current input method and the setting of`enable-multibyte-characters'.</p>
<p>
(fn PROMPT &optional INITIAL INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD)<a name="flycheck-symbol-list-p"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-symbol-list-p</h3>

Check veracity of all `declare-function' statements under directory ROOT.
Returns non-nil if any false statements are found.</p>
<p>
(fn ROOT)<a name="backward-word"></a>
<h3>Function: backward-word</h3>
Move backward until encountering the beginning of a word.
With argument ARG, do this that many times.<a name="frame-first-window"></a>
<h3>Function: frame-first-window</h3>
Return the topmost, leftmost live window on FRAME-OR-WINDOW.
If omitted, FRAME-OR-WINDOW defaults to the currently selected frame.
Else if FRAME-OR-WINDOW denotes a valid window, return the first window
of that window's frame.  If FRAME-OR-WINDOW denotes a live frame, return
the first window of that frame.</p>
<p>

Return the number of days represented by TIME.
Returns a floating point number.<a name="shell-process-popd"></a>
<h3>Function: shell-process-popd</h3></p>
<p>

(fn ARG)<a name="log-edit"></a>
<h3>Function: log-edit</h3>
Setup a buffer to enter a log message.
The buffer is put in mode MODE or `log-edit-mode' if MODE is nil.</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `log-edit-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
If SETUP is non-nil, erase the buffer and run `log-edit-hook'.
Set mark and point around the entire contents of the buffer, so
that it is easy to kill the contents of the buffer with
C-w.  Once the user is done editing the message,
invoking the command M-x log-edit-done (`log-edit-done') will
call CALLBACK to do the actual commit.</p>
<p>
PARAMS if non-nil is an alist of variables and buffer-local
values to give them in the Log Edit buffer.  Possible keys and
associated values:
 `log-edit-listfun' -- function taking no arguments that returns the list of
 files that are concerned by the current operation (using relative names);
 `log-edit-diff-function' -- function taking no arguments that
 displays a diff of the files concerned by the current operation.

<h3>Function: previous-property-change</h3>
Return the position of previous property change.
Scans characters backwards from POSITION in OBJECT till it finds
a change in some text property, then returns the position of the change.
If the optional second argument OBJECT is a buffer (or nil, which means
the current buffer), POSITION is a buffer position (integer or marker).
If OBJECT is a string, POSITION is a 0-based index into it.
Return nil if the property is constant all the way to the start of OBJECT.
If the value is non-nil, it is a position less than POSITION, never equal.</p>
<p>
If the optional third argument LIMIT is non-nil, don't search
back past position LIMIT; return LIMIT if nothing is found until LIMIT.</p>

(fn PROC STRING)<a name="ansi-color-make-face"></a>
<h3>Function: ansi-color-make-face</h3>
Return a face with PROPERTY set to COLOR.
PROPERTY can be either symbol `foreground' or symbol `background'.</p>
<p>
For Emacs, we just return the cons cell (PROPERTY . COLOR).
For XEmacs, we create a temporary face and return it.<a name="x-get-resource"></a>
<h3>Function: x-get-resource</h3>
Return the value of ATTRIBUTE, of class CLASS, from the X defaults database.
This uses `INSTANCE.ATTRIBUTE' as the key and `Emacs.CLASS' as the
class, where INSTANCE is the name under which Emacs was invoked, or
the name specified by the `-name' or `-rn' command-line arguments.</p>
<p>
The optional arguments COMPONENT and SUBCLASS add to the key and the
class, respectively.  You must specify both of them or neither.
If you specify them, the key is `INSTANCE.COMPONENT.ATTRIBUTE'
and the class is `Emacs.CLASS.SUBCLASS'.</p>
<p>
(fn ATTRIBUTE CLASS &optional COMPONENT SUBCLASS)<a name="read-from-minibuffer"></a>
<h3>Function: read-from-minibuffer</h3>
Read a string from the minibuffer, prompting with string PROMPT.
The optional second arg INITIAL-CONTENTS is an obsolete alternative to
  DEFAULT-VALUE.  It normally should be nil in new code, except when
  HIST is a cons.  It is discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p>
Third arg KEYMAP is a keymap to use whilst reading;
  if omitted or nil, the default is `minibuffer-local-map'.</p>
<p>
If fourth arg READ is non-nil, interpret the result as a Lisp object
  and return that object:
  in other words, do `(car (read-from-string INPUT-STRING))'</p>
<p>
Fifth arg HIST, if non-nil, specifies a history list and optionally
  the initial position in the list.  It can be a symbol, which is the
  history list variable to use, or a cons cell (HISTVAR . HISTPOS).
  In that case, HISTVAR is the history list variable to use, and
  HISTPOS is the initial position for use by the minibuffer history
  commands.  For consistency, you should also specify that element of
  the history as the value of INITIAL-CONTENTS.  Positions are counted
  starting from 1 at the beginning of the list.</p>
<p>
Sixth arg DEFAULT-VALUE, if non-nil, should be a string, which is used
  as the default to `read' if READ is non-nil and the user enters
  empty input.  But if READ is nil, this function does _not_ return
  DEFAULT-VALUE for empty input!  Instead, it returns the empty string.</p>
<p>
  Whatever the value of READ, DEFAULT-VALUE is made available via the
  minibuffer history commands.  DEFAULT-VALUE can also be a list of
  strings, in which case all the strings are available in the history,
  and the first string is the default to `read' if READ is non-nil.</p>
<p>
Seventh arg INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD, if non-nil, means the minibuffer inherits
 the current input method and the setting of `enable-multibyte-characters'.</p>
<p>
If the variable `minibuffer-allow-text-properties' is non-nil,
 then the string which is returned includes whatever text properties
 were present in the minibuffer.  Otherwise the value has no text properties.</p>
<p>
The remainder of this documentation string describes the
INITIAL-CONTENTS argument in more detail.  It is only relevant when
studying existing code, or when HIST is a cons.  If non-nil,
INITIAL-CONTENTS is a string to be inserted into the minibuffer before
reading input.  Normally, point is put at the end of that string.
However, if INITIAL-CONTENTS is (STRING . POSITION), the initial
input is STRING, but point is placed at _one-indexed_ position
POSITION in the minibuffer.  Any integer value less than or equal to
one puts point at the beginning of the string.  *Note* that this
behavior differs from the way such arguments are used in `completing-read'
and some related functions, which use zero-indexing for POSITION.</p>

URI-encode STRING and return the result.
If STRING is multibyte, it is first converted to a utf-8 byte
string.  Each byte corresponding to an allowed character is left
as-is, while all other bytes are converted to a three-character
string: "%" followed by two upper-case hex digits.</p>
<p>
The allowed characters are specified by ALLOWED-CHARS.  If this
argument is nil, the list `url-unreserved-chars' determines the
allowed characters.  Otherwise, ALLOWED-CHARS should be a vector
whose Nth element is non-nil if character N is allowed.<a name="ido-find-file-read-only-other-window"></a>

Create an image.
FILE-OR-DATA is an image file name or image data.
Optional TYPE is a symbol describing the image type.  If TYPE is omitted
or nil, try to determine the image type from its first few bytes
of image data.  If that doesn't work, and FILE-OR-DATA is a file name,
use its file extension as image type.
Optional DATA-P non-nil means FILE-OR-DATA is a string containing image data.
Optional PROPS are additional image attributes to assign to the image,
like, e.g. `:mask MASK'.
Value is the image created, or nil if images of type TYPE are not supported.</p>
<p>
Images should not be larger than specified by `max-image-size'.</p>

BUFFER is the buffer (or `buffer-name') to associate with the process.
 Process output goes at end of that buffer, unless you specify
 an output stream or filter function to handle the output.
 BUFFER may be also nil, meaning that this process is not associated
 with any buffer
Third arg is name of the host to connect to, or its IP address.

<h3>Function: dirtrack</h3>
Determine the current directory from the process output for a prompt.
This filter function is used by `dirtrack-mode'.  It looks for
the prompt specified by `dirtrack-list', and calls
`shell-process-cd' if the directory seems to have changed away
from `default-directory'.</p>
<p>
(fn INPUT)<a name="c++-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: c++-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing C++ code.
To submit a problem report, enter `M-x c-submit-bug-report' from a

<h3>Function: dired-do-flagged-delete</h3>
In Dired, delete the files flagged for deletion.
If NOMESSAGE is non-nil, we don't display any message
if there are no flagged files.
`dired-recursive-deletes' controls whether deletion of
non-empty directories is allowed.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional NOMESSAGE)<a name="posn-area"></a>
<h3>Function: posn-area</h3>
Return the window area recorded in POSITION, or nil for the text area.
POSITION should be a list of the form returned by the `event-start'

(fn S1 S2)<a name="find-file-name-handler"></a>
<h3>Function: find-file-name-handler</h3>
Return FILENAME's handler function for OPERATION, if it has one.
Otherwise, return nil.
A file name is handled if one of the regular expressions in
`file-name-handler-alist' matches it.</p>
<p>
If OPERATION equals `inhibit-file-name-operation', then we ignore
any handlers that are members of `inhibit-file-name-handlers',
but we still do run any other handlers.  This lets handlers
use the standard functions without calling themselves recursively.</p>
<p>
(fn FILENAME OPERATION)<a name="custom-variable-edit-lisp"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-variable-edit-lisp</h3>
Edit the Lisp representation of the value of WIDGET.<a name="rfc2047-decode-address-region"></a>

<h3>Function: pp-eval-last-sexp</h3>
Run `pp-eval-expression' on sexp before point.
With argument, pretty-print output into current buffer.
Ignores leading comment characters.<a name="x-set-selection"></a>
<h3>Function: x-set-selection</h3>
Make an X selection of type TYPE and value DATA.
The argument TYPE (nil means `PRIMARY') says which selection, and
DATA specifies the contents.  TYPE must be a symbol.  (It can also
be a string, which stands for the symbol with that name, but this
is considered obsolete.)  DATA may be a string, a symbol, an
integer (or a cons of two integers or list of two integers).</p>
<p>
The selection may also be a cons of two markers pointing to the same buffer,
or an overlay.  In these cases, the selection is considered to be the text
between the markers *at whatever time the selection is examined*.
Thus, editing done in the buffer after you specify the selection
can alter the effective value of the selection.</p>
<p>
The data may also be a vector of valid non-vector selection values.</p>
<p>
The return value is DATA.</p>
<p>
Interactively, this command sets the primary selection.  Without
prefix argument, it reads the selection in the minibuffer.  With
prefix argument, it uses the text of the region as the selection value.</p>

<p>

Turning on Paragraph-Indent Text mode runs the normal hooks
`text-mode-hook' and `paragraph-indent-text-mode-hook'.<a name="switch-to-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: switch-to-buffer</h3>
Display buffer BUFFER-OR-NAME in the selected window.</p>
<p>
WARNING: This is NOT the way to work on another buffer temporarily
within a Lisp program!  Use `set-buffer' instead.  That avoids
messing with the window-buffer correspondences.</p>
<p>
If the selected window cannot display the specified
buffer (e.g. if it is a minibuffer window or strongly dedicated
to another buffer), call `pop-to-buffer' to select the buffer in
another window.</p>
<p>
If called interactively, read the buffer name using the
minibuffer.  The variable `confirm-nonexistent-file-or-buffer'
determines whether to request confirmation before creating a new
buffer.</p>
<p>
BUFFER-OR-NAME may be a buffer, a string (a buffer name), or nil.
If BUFFER-OR-NAME is a string that does not identify an existing
buffer, create a buffer with that name.  If BUFFER-OR-NAME is
nil, switch to the buffer returned by `other-buffer'.</p>
<p>
If optional argument NORECORD is non-nil, do not put the buffer
at the front of the buffer list, and do not make the window
displaying it the most recently selected one.</p>
<p>
If optional argument FORCE-SAME-WINDOW is non-nil, the buffer
must be displayed in the selected window; if that is impossible,
signal an error rather than calling `pop-to-buffer'.</p>
<p>
The option `switch-to-buffer-preserve-window-point' can be used
to make the buffer appear at its last position in the selected
window.</p>
<p>
Return the buffer switched to.<a name="internal-char-font"></a>

(fn POSITION &optional CH)<a name="current-window-configuration"></a>
<h3>Function: current-window-configuration</h3>
Return an object representing the current window configuration of FRAME.
If FRAME is nil or omitted, use the selected frame.
This describes the number of windows, their sizes and current buffers,
and for each displayed buffer, where display starts, and the positions of
point and mark.  An exception is made for point in the current buffer:
its value is -not- saved.
This also records the currently selected frame, and FRAME's focus
redirection (see `redirect-frame-focus').  The variable
`window-persistent-parameters' specifies which window parameters are
saved by this function.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FRAME)<a name="set-frame-position"></a>
<h3>Function: set-frame-position</h3>
Sets position of FRAME in pixels to XOFFSET by YOFFSET.
This is actually the position of the upper left corner of the frame.
Negative values for XOFFSET or YOFFSET are interpreted relative to
the rightmost or bottommost possible position (that stays within the screen).</p>
<p>
(fn FRAME XOFFSET YOFFSET)<a name="previous-overlay-change"></a>
<h3>Function: previous-overlay-change</h3>
Return the previous position before POS where an overlay starts or ends.

only these files will be asked to be saved.</p>
<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="walk-window-subtree"></a>
<h3>Function: walk-window-subtree</h3>
Run function FUN on the subtree of windows rooted at WINDOW.
WINDOW defaults to the selected window.  FUN must be a function
with one argument - a window.  By default, run FUN only on live
windows of the subtree.  If the optional argument ANY is non-nil,
run FUN on all live and internal windows of the subtree.  If
WINDOW is live, run FUN on WINDOW only.</p>
<p>
This function performs a pre-order, depth-first traversal of the
subtree rooted at WINDOW.  If FUN changes that tree, the result
is unpredictable.<a name="compile-goto-error"></a>

(fn KEY &optional DEFAULT)<a name="table-fixed-width-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: table-fixed-width-mode</h3>
Cell width is fixed when this is non-nil.
Normally it should be nil for allowing automatic cell width expansion
that widens a cell when it is necessary.  When non-nil, typing in a
cell does not automatically expand the cell width.  A word that is too
long to fit in a cell is chopped into multiple lines.  The chopped
location is indicated by `table-word-continuation-char'.  This
variable's value can be toggled by M-x table-fixed-width-mode at
run-time.</p>

(fn &optional BUFFER)<a name="run-hook-wrapped"></a>
<h3>Function: run-hook-wrapped</h3>
Run HOOK, passing each function through WRAP-FUNCTION.
I.e. instead of calling each function FUN directly with arguments ARGS,
it calls WRAP-FUNCTION with arguments FUN and ARGS.
As soon as a call to WRAP-FUNCTION returns non-nil, `run-hook-wrapped'
aborts and returns that value.</p>
<p>
(fn HOOK WRAP-FUNCTION &rest ARGS)<a name="color-gray-p"></a>
<h3>Function: color-gray-p</h3>

<p>
If buffer `*SQL*' exists but no process is running, make a new process.
If buffer exists and a process is running, just switch to buffer
`*SQL*'.</p>
<p>
Interpreter used comes from variable `sql-db2-program'.  There is not
automatic login.</p>
<p>
The buffer is put in SQL interactive mode, giving commands for sending
input.  See `sql-interactive-mode'.</p>
<p>
If you use M-x sql-accumulate-and-indent to send multiline commands to
db2, newlines will be escaped if necessary.  If you don't want that, set
`comint-input-sender' back to `comint-simple-send' by writing an after
advice.  See the elisp manual for more information.</p>
<p>
To set the buffer name directly, use C-u
before M-x sql-db2.  Once session has started,
M-x sql-rename-buffer can be called separately to rename the
buffer.</p>
<p>
To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the input and output to the process, use C-x RET c
before M-x sql-db2.  You can also specify this with C-x RET p
in the SQL buffer, after you start the process.
The default comes from `process-coding-system-alist' and
`default-process-coding-system'.</p>

<h3>Function: risky-local-variable-p</h3>
Non-nil if SYM could be dangerous as a file-local variable.
It is dangerous if either of these conditions are met:</p>
<p>
 * Its `risky-local-variable' property is non-nil.</p>
<p>
 * Its name ends with "hook(s)", "function(s)", "form(s)", "map",
   "program", "command(s)", "predicate(s)", "frame-alist",

   "map-alist", or "bindat-spec".<a name="ispell-buffer-local-dict"></a>
<h3>Function: ispell-buffer-local-dict</h3>
Initializes local dictionary and local personal dictionary.
If optional NO-RELOAD is non-nil, do not reload any dictionary.
When a dictionary is defined in the buffer (see variable

<h3>Function: minor-mode-key-binding</h3>
Find the visible minor mode bindings of KEY.
Return an alist of pairs (MODENAME . BINDING), where MODENAME is
the symbol which names the minor mode binding KEY, and BINDING is
KEY's definition in that mode.  In particular, if KEY has no
minor-mode bindings, return nil.  If the first binding is a
non-prefix, all subsequent bindings will be omitted, since they would
be ignored.  Similarly, the list doesn't include non-prefix bindings
that come after prefix bindings.</p>
<p>
If optional argument ACCEPT-DEFAULT is non-nil, recognize default
bindings; see the description of `lookup-key' for more details about this.</p>

(fn &key BUFFER CHECKER FILENAME LINE COLUMN MESSAGE LEVEL ID)<a name="ert-equal-including-properties"></a>
<h3>Function: ert-equal-including-properties</h3>
Return t if A and B have similar structure and contents.</p>
<p>
This is like `equal-including-properties' except that it compares
the property values of text properties structurally (by
recursing) rather than with `eq'.  Perhaps this is what
`equal-including-properties' should do in the first place; see
Emacs bug 6581 at URL `http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=6581'.<a name="timer-inc-time"></a>
<h3>Function: timer-inc-time</h3>
Increment the time set in TIMER by SECS seconds, USECS nanoseconds,
and PSECS picoseconds.  SECS may be a fraction.  If USECS or PSECS are
omitted, they are treated as zero.<a name="sort-subr"></a>
<h3>Function: sort-subr</h3>
General text sorting routine to divide buffer into records and sort them.</p>
<p>
We divide the accessible portion of the buffer into disjoint pieces
called sort records.  A portion of each sort record (perhaps all of
it) is designated as the sort key.  The records are rearranged in the
buffer in order by their sort keys.  The records may or may not be
contiguous.</p>
<p>
Usually the records are rearranged in order of ascending sort key.
If REVERSE is non-nil, they are rearranged in order of descending sort key.
The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects
the sort order.</p>
<p>
The next four arguments are functions to be called to move point
across a sort record.  They will be called many times from within sort-subr.</p>
<p>
NEXTRECFUN is called with point at the end of the previous record.
It moves point to the start of the next record.
It should move point to the end of the buffer if there are no more records.
The first record is assumed to start at the position of point when sort-subr
is called.</p>
<p>
ENDRECFUN is called with point within the record.
It should move point to the end of the record.</p>
<p>
STARTKEYFUN moves from the start of the record to the start of the key.
It may return either a non-nil value to be used as the key, or
else the key is the substring between the values of point after
STARTKEYFUN and ENDKEYFUN are called.  If STARTKEYFUN is nil, the key
starts at the beginning of the record.</p>
<p>
ENDKEYFUN moves from the start of the sort key to the end of the sort key.
ENDKEYFUN may be nil if STARTKEYFUN returns a value or if it would be the
same as ENDRECFUN.</p>
<p>
PREDICATE, if non-nil, is the predicate function for comparing
keys; it is called with two arguments, the keys to compare, and
should return non-nil if the first key should sort before the
second key.  If PREDICATE is nil, comparison is done with `<' if
the keys are numbers, with `compare-buffer-substrings' if the
keys are cons cells (the car and cdr of each cons cell are taken
as start and end positions), and with `string<' otherwise.</p>
<p>
(fn REVERSE NEXTRECFUN ENDRECFUN &optional STARTKEYFUN ENDKEYFUN PREDICATE)<a name="enriched-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: enriched-mode</h3>
Minor mode for editing text/enriched files.
These are files with embedded formatting information in the MIME standard
text/enriched format.</p>
<p>
With a prefix argument ARG, enable the mode if ARG is positive,
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode
if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Turning the mode on or off runs `enriched-mode-hook'.</p>
<p>
More information about Enriched mode is available in the file
etc/enriched.doc in the Emacs distribution directory.</p>

(fn &rest BYTES)<a name="auth-source-secrets-search"></a>
<h3>Function: auth-source-secrets-search</h3>
Search the Secrets API; spec is like `auth-source'.</p>
<p>
The :label key specifies the item's label.  It is the only key
that can specify a substring.  Any :label value besides a string
will allow any label.</p>
<p>
All other search keys must match exactly.  If you need substring
matching, do a wider search and narrow it down yourself.</p>
<p>
You'll get back all the properties of the token as a plist.</p>
<p>
Here's an example that looks for the first item in the 'Login'
Secrets collection:</p>
<p>
 (let ((auth-sources '("secrets:Login")))
    (auth-source-search :max 1)</p>
<p>
Here's another that looks for the first item in the 'Login'
Secrets collection whose label contains 'gnus':</p>
<p>
 (let ((auth-sources '("secrets:Login")))
    (auth-source-search :max 1 :label "gnus")</p>
<p>
And this one looks for the first item in the 'Login' Secrets
collection that's a Google Chrome entry for the git.gnus.org site
authentication tokens:</p>

(fn &optional ARG)<a name="progress-reporter-update"></a>
<h3>Function: progress-reporter-update</h3>
Report progress of an operation in the echo area.
REPORTER should be the result of a call to `make-progress-reporter'.</p>
<p>
If REPORTER is a numerical progress reporter---i.e. if it was
 made using non-nil MIN-VALUE and MAX-VALUE arguments to
 `make-progress-reporter'---then VALUE should be a number between
 MIN-VALUE and MAX-VALUE.</p>
<p>
If REPORTER is a non-numerical reporter, VALUE should be nil.</p>
<p>
This function is relatively inexpensive.  If the change since
last update is too small or insufficient time has passed, it does
nothing.<a name="describe-buffer-bindings"></a>
<h3>Function: describe-buffer-bindings</h3>
Insert the list of all defined keys and their definitions.
The list is inserted in the current buffer, while the bindings are
looked up in BUFFER.
The optional argument PREFIX, if non-nil, should be a key sequence;
then we display only bindings that start with that prefix.

Describe the input method currently in use.
This is a subroutine for `describe-input-method'.<a name="facemenu-set-foreground"></a>
<h3>Function: facemenu-set-foreground</h3>
Set the foreground COLOR of the region or next character typed.
This command reads the color in the minibuffer.</p>
<p>
If the region is active (normally true except in Transient Mark mode)
and there is no prefix argument, this command sets the region to the
requested face.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, this command specifies the face for the next character
inserted.  Moving point or switching buffers before
typing a character to insert cancels the specification.<a name="minibuffer-history-isearch-pop-state"></a>

buffers which are visiting a file.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FILES-ONLY)<a name="scan-buf-move-to-region"></a>
<h3>Function: scan-buf-move-to-region</h3>
Go to the start of the next region with non-nil PROP property.
Then run HOOK, which should be a quoted symbol that is a normal
hook variable, or an expression evaluating to such a symbol.
Adjacent areas with different non-nil PROP properties are
considered different regions.</p>
<p>
With numeric argument ARG, move to the start of the ARGth next
such region, then run HOOK.  If ARG is negative, move backward.
If point is already in a region, then that region does not count
toward ARG.  If ARG is 0 and point is inside a region, move to
the start of that region.  If ARG is 0 and point is not in a
region, print a message to that effect, but do not move point and
do not run HOOK.  If there are not enough regions to move over,
an error results and the number of available regions is mentioned
in the error message.  Point is not moved and HOOK is not run.</p>

<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="locate-file"></a>
<h3>Function: locate-file</h3>
Search for FILENAME through PATH.
If found, return the absolute file name of FILENAME, with its suffixes;
otherwise return nil.
PATH should be a list of directories to look in, like the lists in
`exec-path' or `load-path'.
If SUFFIXES is non-nil, it should be a list of suffixes to append to
file name when searching.  If SUFFIXES is nil, it is equivalent to '("").
Use '("/") to disable PATH search, but still try the suffixes in SUFFIXES.
If non-nil, PREDICATE is used instead of `file-readable-p'.</p>
<p>
This function will normally skip directories, so if you want it to find
directories, make sure the PREDICATE function returns `dir-ok' for them.</p>
<p>
PREDICATE can also be an integer to pass to the `access' system call,
in which case file-name handlers are ignored.  This usage is deprecated.
For compatibility, PREDICATE can also be one of the symbols
`executable', `readable', `writable', or `exists', or a list of
one or more of those symbols.<a name="subst-char-in-region"></a>
<h3>Function: subst-char-in-region</h3>
From START to END, replace FROMCHAR with TOCHAR each time it occurs.
If optional arg NOUNDO is non-nil, don't record this change for undo
and don't mark the buffer as really changed.
Both characters must have the same length of multi-byte form.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: comint-forward-matching-input</h3>
Search forward through buffer for input fields that match REGEXP.
If `comint-use-prompt-regexp' is non-nil, then input fields are identified
by lines that match `comint-prompt-regexp'.</p>
<p>
With prefix argument N, search for Nth following match.
If N is negative, find the previous or Nth previous match.</p>
<p>
(fn REGEXP N)<a name="yank-pop"></a>
<h3>Function: yank-pop</h3>
Replace just-yanked stretch of killed text with a different stretch.
This command is allowed only immediately after a `yank' or a `yank-pop'.
At such a time, the region contains a stretch of reinserted
previously-killed text.  `yank-pop' deletes that text and inserts in its
place a different stretch of killed text.</p>
<p>
With no argument, the previous kill is inserted.
With argument N, insert the Nth previous kill.
If N is negative, this is a more recent kill.</p>
<p>
The sequence of kills wraps around, so that after the oldest one
comes the newest one.</p>
<p>
When this command inserts killed text into the buffer, it honors
`yank-excluded-properties' and `yank-handler' as described in the
doc string for `insert-for-yank-1', which see.<a name="booleanp"></a>
<h3>Function: booleanp</h3>
Return t if OBJECT is one of the two canonical boolean values: t or nil.
Otherwise, return nil.<a name="make-directory"></a>
<h3>Function: make-directory</h3>
Create the directory DIR and optionally any nonexistent parent dirs.
If DIR already exists as a directory, signal an error, unless
PARENTS is non-nil.</p>
<p>
Interactively, the default choice of directory to create is the
current buffer's default directory.  That is useful when you have
visited a file in a nonexistent directory.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, the second (optional) argument PARENTS, if
non-nil, says whether to create parent directories that don't
exist.  Interactively, this happens by default.</p>
<p>
If creating the directory or directories fail, an error will be
raised.<a name="diff-ignore-whitespace-hunk"></a>
<h3>Function: diff-ignore-whitespace-hunk</h3>
Re-diff the current hunk, ignoring whitespace differences.</p>

with no args, if that value is non-nil.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="modify-syntax-entry"></a>
<h3>Function: modify-syntax-entry</h3>
Set syntax for character CHAR according to string NEWENTRY.
The syntax is changed only for table SYNTAX-TABLE, which defaults to
 the current buffer's syntax table.
CHAR may be a cons (MIN . MAX), in which case, syntaxes of all characters
in the range MIN to MAX are changed.
The first character of NEWENTRY should be one of the following:
  Space or -  whitespace syntax.    w   word constituent.
  _           symbol constituent.   .   punctuation.
  (           open-parenthesis.     )   close-parenthesis.
  "           string quote.         \   escape.
  $           paired delimiter.     '   expression quote or prefix operator.
  <           comment starter.      >   comment ender.
  /           character-quote.      @   inherit from parent table.
  |           generic string fence. !   generic comment fence.</p>
<p>
Only single-character comment start and end sequences are represented thus.
Two-character sequences are represented as described below.
The second character of NEWENTRY is the matching parenthesis,
 used only if the first character is `(' or `)'.
Any additional characters are flags.
Defined flags are the characters 1, 2, 3, 4, b, p, and n.
 1 means CHAR is the start of a two-char comment start sequence.
 2 means CHAR is the second character of such a sequence.
 3 means CHAR is the start of a two-char comment end sequence.
 4 means CHAR is the second character of such a sequence.</p>
<p>
There can be several orthogonal comment sequences.  This is to support
language modes such as C++.  By default, all comment sequences are of style
a, but you can set the comment sequence style to b (on the second character
of a comment-start, and the first character of a comment-end sequence) and/or
c (on any of its chars) using this flag:
 b means CHAR is part of comment sequence b.
 c means CHAR is part of comment sequence c.
 n means CHAR is part of a nestable comment sequence.</p>
<p>
 p means CHAR is a prefix character for `backward-prefix-chars';
   such characters are treated as whitespace when they occur
   between expressions.</p>
<p>
(fn CHAR NEWENTRY &optional SYNTAX-TABLE)<a name="match-end"></a>
<h3>Function: match-end</h3>
Return position of end of text matched by last search.
SUBEXP, a number, specifies which parenthesized expression in the last
  regexp.
Value is nil if SUBEXPth pair didn't match, or there were less than
  SUBEXP pairs.

Lisp concepts such as cdr, car, cons cell and list.</p>
<p>
(fn LIST)<a name="whois"></a>
<h3>Function: whois</h3>
Send SEARCH-STRING to server defined by the `whois-server-name' variable.
If `whois-guess-server' is non-nil, then try to deduce the correct server
from SEARCH-STRING.  With argument, prompt for whois server.</p>
<p>
(fn ARG SEARCH-STRING)<a name="compare-windows"></a>
<h3>Function: compare-windows</h3>
Compare text in current window with text in next window.
Compares the text starting at point in each window,
moving over text in each one as far as they match.</p>
<p>
This command pushes the mark in each window
at the prior location of point in that window.
If both windows display the same buffer,
the mark is pushed twice in that buffer:
first in the other window, then in the selected window.</p>
<p>
A prefix arg means reverse the value of variable
`compare-ignore-whitespace'.  If `compare-ignore-whitespace' is
nil, then a prefix arg means ignore changes in whitespace.  If
`compare-ignore-whitespace' is non-nil, then a prefix arg means
don't ignore changes in whitespace.  The variable
`compare-windows-whitespace' controls how whitespace is skipped.
If `compare-ignore-case' is non-nil, changes in case are also
ignored.</p>
<p>
If `compare-windows-sync' is non-nil, then successive calls of
this command work in interlaced mode:
on first call it advances points to the next difference,
on second call it synchronizes points by skipping the difference,
on third call it again advances points to the next difference and so on.</p>
<p>
(fn IGNORE-WHITESPACE)<a name="allout-widgets-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: allout-widgets-mode</h3>
Toggle Allout Widgets mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Allout Widgets mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Allout Widgets mode is an extension of Allout mode that provides
graphical decoration of outline structure.  It is meant to
operate along with `allout-mode', via `allout-mode-hook'.</p>
<p>
The graphics include:</p>
<p>
- guide lines connecting item bullet-icons with those of their subitems.</p>
<p>
- icons for item bullets, varying to indicate whether or not the item
  has subitems, and if so, whether or not the item is expanded.</p>
<p>
- cue area between the bullet-icon and the start of the body headline,
  for item numbering, encryption indicator, and distinctive bullets.</p>
<p>
The bullet-icon and guide line graphics provide keybindings and mouse
bindings for easy outline navigation and exposure control, extending
outline hot-spot navigation (see `allout-mode').</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="window--resize-siblings"></a>
<h3>Function: window--resize-siblings</h3>
Resize other windows when WINDOW is resized vertically by DELTA lines.
Optional argument HORIZONTAL non-nil means resize other windows
when WINDOW is resized horizontally by DELTA columns.  WINDOW
itself is not resized by this function.</p>
<p>
Optional argument IGNORE non-nil means ignore restrictions
imposed by fixed size windows, `window-min-height' or
`window-min-width' settings.  If IGNORE equals `safe', live
windows may get as small as `window-safe-min-height' lines and
`window-safe-min-width' columns.  If IGNORE is a window, ignore
restrictions for that window only.  Any other non-nil value means
ignore all of the above restrictions for all windows.</p>
<p>
Optional arguments TRAIL and EDGE, when non-nil, refine the set
of windows that shall be resized.  If TRAIL equals `before',
resize only windows on the left or above EDGE.  If TRAIL equals
`after', resize only windows on the right or below EDGE.  Also,
preferably only resize windows adjacent to EDGE.<a name="other-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: other-frame</h3>
Select the ARGth different visible frame on current display, and raise it.
All frames are arranged in a cyclic order.
This command selects the frame ARG steps away in that order.
A negative ARG moves in the opposite order.</p>
<p>
To make this command work properly, you must tell Emacs
how the system (or the window manager) generally handles
focus-switching between windows.  If moving the mouse onto a window
selects it (gives it focus), set `focus-follows-mouse' to t.
Otherwise, that variable should be nil.<a name="custom-toggle-hide-face"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-toggle-hide-face</h3>
Toggle the visibility of a `custom-face' parent widget.
By default, this signals an error if the parent has unsaved
changes.  If the parent has a `simple' :custom-style property,

<p>
Variables controlling indentation style:
 `perl-tab-always-indent'
    Non-nil means TAB in Perl mode should always indent the current line,
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 `perl-tab-to-comment'
    Non-nil means that for lines which don't need indenting, TAB will
    either delete an empty comment, indent an existing comment, move
    to end-of-line, or if at end-of-line already, create a new comment.
 `perl-nochange'
    Lines starting with this regular expression are not auto-indented.
 `perl-indent-level'
    Indentation of Perl statements within surrounding block.
    The surrounding block's indentation is the indentation
    of the line on which the open-brace appears.
 `perl-continued-statement-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a substatement, such as the
    then-clause of an if or body of a while.
 `perl-continued-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a brace that starts a substatement.
    This is in addition to `perl-continued-statement-offset'.
 `perl-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation for line if it starts with an open brace.
 `perl-brace-imaginary-offset'
    An open brace following other text is treated as if it were
    this far to the right of the start of its line.
 `perl-label-offset'
    Extra indentation for line that is a label.
 `perl-indent-continued-arguments'
    Offset of argument lines relative to usual indentation.</p>
<p>
Various indentation styles:       K&R  BSD  BLK  GNU  LW

<h3>Function: browse-url-firefox</h3>
Ask the Firefox WWW browser to load URL.
Default to the URL around or before point.  The strings in
variable `browse-url-firefox-arguments' are also passed to
Firefox.</p>
<p>
When called interactively, if variable
`browse-url-new-window-flag' is non-nil, load the document in a
new Firefox window, otherwise use a random existing one.  A
non-nil interactive prefix argument reverses the effect of
`browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
If `browse-url-firefox-new-window-is-tab' is non-nil, then
whenever a document would otherwise be loaded in a new window, it
is loaded in a new tab in an existing window instead.</p>
<p>
When called non-interactively, optional second argument
NEW-WINDOW is used instead of `browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
On MS-Windows systems the optional `new-window' parameter is
ignored.  Firefox for Windows does not support the "-remote"
command line parameter.  Therefore, the
`browse-url-new-window-flag' and `browse-url-firefox-new-window-is-tab'
are ignored as well.  Firefox on Windows will always open the requested
URL in a new window.</p>
<p>
(fn URL &optional NEW-WINDOW)<a name="icon-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: icon-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing Icon code.
Expression and list commands understand all Icon brackets.
Tab indents for Icon code.
Paragraphs are separated by blank lines only.
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `icon-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
Variables controlling indentation style:
 icon-tab-always-indent
    Non-nil means TAB in Icon mode should always reindent the current line,
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 icon-auto-newline
    Non-nil means automatically newline before and after braces
    inserted in Icon code.
 icon-indent-level
    Indentation of Icon statements within surrounding block.
    The surrounding block's indentation is the indentation
    of the line on which the open-brace appears.
 icon-continued-statement-offset
    Extra indentation given to a substatement, such as the
    then-clause of an if or body of a while.
 icon-continued-brace-offset
    Extra indentation given to a brace that starts a substatement.
    This is in addition to `icon-continued-statement-offset'.
 icon-brace-offset
    Extra indentation for line if it starts with an open brace.
 icon-brace-imaginary-offset
    An open brace following other text is treated as if it were
    this far to the right of the start of its line.</p>
<p>
Turning on Icon mode calls the value of the variable `icon-mode-hook'
with no args, if that value is non-nil.</p>

<h3>Function: face-spec-choose</h3>
Choose the proper attributes for FRAME, out of SPEC.
If SPEC is nil, return nil.<a name="all-completions"></a>
<h3>Function: all-completions</h3>
Search for partial matches to STRING in COLLECTION.
Test each of the possible completions specified by COLLECTION
to see if it begins with STRING.  The possible completions may be
strings or symbols.  Symbols are converted to strings before testing,
see `symbol-name'.
The value is a list of all the possible completions that match STRING.</p>
<p>
If COLLECTION is an alist, the keys (cars of elements) are the
possible completions.  If an element is not a cons cell, then the
element itself is the possible completion.
If COLLECTION is a hash-table, all the keys that are strings or symbols
are the possible completions.
If COLLECTION is an obarray, the names of all symbols in the obarray
are the possible completions.</p>
<p>
COLLECTION can also be a function to do the completion itself.
It receives three arguments: the values STRING, PREDICATE and t.
Whatever it returns becomes the value of `all-completions'.</p>
<p>
If optional third argument PREDICATE is non-nil,
it is used to test each possible match.
The match is a candidate only if PREDICATE returns non-nil.
The argument given to PREDICATE is the alist element
or the symbol from the obarray.  If COLLECTION is a hash-table,
predicate is called with two arguments: the key and the value.
Additionally to this predicate, `completion-regexp-list'
is used to further constrain the set of candidates.</p>
<p>
An obsolete optional fourth argument HIDE-SPACES is still accepted for
backward compatibility.  If non-nil, strings in COLLECTION that start

(fn)<a name="make-hash-table"></a>
<h3>Function: make-hash-table</h3>
Create and return a new hash table.</p>
<p>
Arguments are specified as keyword/argument pairs.  The following
arguments are defined:</p>
<p>
:test TEST -- TEST must be a symbol that specifies how to compare
keys.  Default is `eql'.  Predefined are the tests `eq', `eql', and
`equal'.  User-supplied test and hash functions can be specified via
`define-hash-table-test'.</p>
<p>
:size SIZE -- A hint as to how many elements will be put in the table.
Default is 65.</p>
<p>
:rehash-size REHASH-SIZE - Indicates how to expand the table when it
fills up.  If REHASH-SIZE is an integer, increase the size by that
amount.  If it is a float, it must be > 1.0, and the new size is the
old size multiplied by that factor.  Default is 1.5.</p>
<p>
:rehash-threshold THRESHOLD -- THRESHOLD must a float > 0, and <= 1.0.
Resize the hash table when the ratio (number of entries / table size)
is greater than or equal to THRESHOLD.  Default is 0.8.</p>
<p>
:weakness WEAK -- WEAK must be one of nil, t, `key', `value',
`key-or-value', or `key-and-value'.  If WEAK is not nil, the table
returned is a weak table.  Key/value pairs are removed from a weak
hash table when there are no non-weak references pointing to their
key, value, one of key or value, or both key and value, depending on
WEAK.  WEAK t is equivalent to `key-and-value'.  Default value of WEAK
is nil.</p>

represents the window tree of the frame's root window, and MINI
is the frame's minibuffer window.</p>
<p>
If the root window is not split, ROOT is the root window itself.
Otherwise, ROOT is a list (DIR EDGES W1 W2 ...) where DIR is nil
for a horizontal split, and t for a vertical split.  EDGES gives
the combined size and position of the child windows in the split,
and the rest of the elements are the child windows in the split.

<p>
(fn PREDICATE SEQ [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="compose-region"></a>
<h3>Function: compose-region</h3>
Compose characters in the current region.</p>
<p>
Characters are composed relatively, i.e. composed by overstriking
or stacking depending on ascent, descent and other metrics of
glyphs.</p>
<p>
For instance, if the region has three characters "XYZ", X is
regarded as BASE glyph, and Y is displayed:
  (1) above BASE if Y's descent value is not positive
  (2) below BASE if Y's ascent value is not positive
  (3) on BASE (i.e. at the BASE position) otherwise
and Z is displayed with the same rule while regarding the whole
XY glyphs as BASE.</p>
<p>
When called from a program, expects these four arguments.</p>
<p>
First two arguments START and END are positions (integers or markers)
specifying the region.</p>
<p>
Optional 3rd argument COMPONENTS, if non-nil, is a character, a string
or a vector or list of integers and rules.</p>
<p>
If it is a character, it is an alternate character to display instead
of the text in the region.</p>
<p>
If it is a string, the elements are alternate characters.  In
this case, TAB element has a special meaning.  If the first
character is TAB, the glyphs are displayed with left padding space
so that no pixel overlaps with the previous column.  If the last
character is TAB, the glyphs are displayed with right padding
space so that no pixel overlaps with the following column.</p>
<p>
If it is a vector or list, it is a sequence of alternate characters and
composition rules, where (2N)th elements are characters and (2N+1)th
elements are composition rules to specify how to compose (2N+2)th

face described by the second element, and so on.  Very old changes remain
shown in the last face in the list.</p>
<p>
You can automatically rotate colors when the buffer is saved by adding
this function to `write-file-functions' as a buffer-local value.  To do
this, eval the following in the buffer to be saved:</p>

<h3>Function: set-face-underline</h3>
Specify whether face FACE is underlined.
UNDERLINE nil means FACE explicitly doesn't underline.
UNDERLINE t means FACE underlines with its foreground color.
If UNDERLINE is a string, underline with that color.</p>
<p>
UNDERLINE may also be a list of the form (:color COLOR :style STYLE),
where COLOR is a string or `foreground-color', and STYLE is either
`line' or `wave'.  :color may be omitted, which means to use the
foreground color.  :style may be omitted, which means to use a line.</p>
<p>
FRAME nil or not specified means change face on all frames.
Use `set-face-attribute' to ``unspecify'' underlining.<a name="backup-file-name-p"></a>
<h3>Function: backup-file-name-p</h3>
Return non-nil if FILE is a backup file name (numeric or not).
This is a separate function so you can redefine it for customization.

<h3>Function: put-image</h3>
Put image IMAGE in front of POS in the current buffer.
IMAGE must be an image created with `create-image' or `defimage'.
IMAGE is displayed by putting an overlay into the current buffer with a
`before-string' STRING that has a `display' property whose value is the
image.  STRING is defaulted if you omit it.
The overlay created will have the `put-image' property set to t.
POS may be an integer or marker.
AREA is where to display the image.  AREA nil or omitted means
display it in the text area, a value of `left-margin' means
display it in the left marginal area, a value of `right-margin'
means display it in the right marginal area.<a name="find-variable-other-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: find-variable-other-frame</h3>

<h3>Function: mm-make-temp-file</h3>
Create a temporary file.
The returned file name (created by appending some random characters at the end
of PREFIX, and expanding against `temporary-file-directory' if necessary),
is guaranteed to point to a newly created empty file.
You can then use `write-region' to write new data into the file.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: read-char</h3>
Read a character from the command input (keyboard or macro).
It is returned as a number.
If the character has modifiers, they are resolved and reflected to the
character code if possible (e.g. C-SPC -> 0).</p>
<p>
If the user generates an event which is not a character (i.e. a mouse
click or function key event), `read-char' signals an error.  As an
exception, switch-frame events are put off until non-character events
can be read.
If you want to read non-character events, or ignore them, call
`read-event' or `read-char-exclusive' instead.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument PROMPT is non-nil, display that as a prompt.
If the optional argument INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD is non-nil and some
input method is turned on in the current buffer, that input method
is used for reading a character.
If the optional argument SECONDS is non-nil, it should be a number
specifying the maximum number of seconds to wait for input.  If no
input arrives in that time, return nil.  SECONDS may be a
floating-point value.</p>

comparing them.</p>
<p>
(fn COMPARATOR LIST)<a name="epl-find-installed-packages"></a>
<h3>Function: epl-find-installed-packages</h3>
Find all installed packages by NAME.</p>
<p>
NAME is a package name, as symbol.</p>

packages with NAME.</p>
<p>
(fn NAME)<a name="rx-atomic-p"></a>
<h3>Function: rx-atomic-p</h3>
Return non-nil if regexp string R is atomic.
An atomic regexp R is one such that a suffix operator
appended to R will apply to all of R.  For example, "a"
"[abc]" and "\(ab\|ab*c\)" are atomic and "ab",
"[ab]c", and "ab\|ab*c" are not atomic.</p>
<p>
This function may return false negatives, but it will not
return false positives.  It is nevertheless useful in
situations where an efficiency shortcut can be taken only if a
regexp is atomic.  The function can be improved to detect
more cases of atomic regexps.  Presently, this function
detects the following categories of atomic regexp;</p>
<p>
  a group or shy group:  \(...\)
  a character class:     [...]
  a single character:    a</p>
<p>
On the other hand, false negatives will be returned for
regexps that are atomic but end in operators, such as
"a+".  I think these are rare.  Probably such cases could
be detected without much effort.  A guarantee of no false
negatives would require a theoretic specification of the set
of all atomic regexps.<a name="cl-cdaddr"></a>

<h3>Function: ange-ftp-re-read-dir</h3>
Reread remote directory DIR to update the directory cache.
The implementation of remote FTP file names caches directory contents
for speed.  Therefore, when new remote files are created, Emacs
may not know they exist.  You can use this command to reread a specific
directory, so that Emacs will know its current contents.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: kmacro-edit-macro</h3>
As edit last keyboard macro, but without kmacro-repeat property.<a name="mouse-kill-secondary"></a>
<h3>Function: mouse-kill-secondary</h3>
Kill the text in the secondary selection.
This is intended more as a keyboard command than as a mouse command
but it can work as either one.</p>
<p>
The current buffer (in case of keyboard use), or the buffer clicked on,
must be the one that the secondary selection is in.  This requirement
is to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="epa-encrypt-region"></a>
<h3>Function: epa-encrypt-region</h3>
Encrypt the current region between START and END for RECIPIENTS.</p>
<p>
Don't use this command in Lisp programs!
Since this function operates on regions, it does some tricks such
as coding-system detection and unibyte/multibyte conversion.  If
you are sure how the data should be treated, you should consider
using the string based counterpart `epg-encrypt-string', or the
file based counterpart `epg-encrypt-file' instead.</p>
<p>
For example:</p>
<p>
(let ((context (epg-make-context 'OpenPGP)))
  (epg-encrypt-string
    context
    (encode-coding-string (buffer-substring start end) 'utf-8)
    nil))</p>
<p>
(fn START END RECIPIENTS SIGN SIGNERS)<a name="window-left-column"></a>
<h3>Function: window-left-column</h3>
Return left column of window WINDOW.
This is the distance, in columns, between the left edge of WINDOW and
the left edge of the frame's window area.  For instance, the return
value is 0 if there is no window to the left of WINDOW.</p>
<p>
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WINDOW)<a name="compare-buffer-substrings"></a>
<h3>Function: compare-buffer-substrings</h3>
Compare two substrings of two buffers; return result as number.
Return -N if first string is less after N-1 chars, +N if first string is
greater after N-1 chars, or 0 if strings match.  Each substring is
represented as three arguments: BUFFER, START and END.  That makes six
args in all, three for each substring.</p>
<p>
The value of `case-fold-search' in the current buffer
determines whether case is significant or ignored.</p>
<p>
(fn BUFFER1 START1 END1 BUFFER2 START2 END2)<a name="char-resolve-modifiers"></a>
<h3>Function: char-resolve-modifiers</h3>
Resolve modifiers in the character CHAR.
The value is a character with modifiers resolved into the character
code.  Unresolved modifiers are kept in the value.</p>
<p>
(fn CHAR)<a name="defvaralias"></a>
<h3>Function: defvaralias</h3>
Make NEW-ALIAS a variable alias for symbol BASE-VARIABLE.
Aliased variables always have the same value; setting one sets the other.
Third arg DOCSTRING, if non-nil, is documentation for NEW-ALIAS.  If it is
omitted or nil, NEW-ALIAS gets the documentation string of BASE-VARIABLE,
or of the variable at the end of the chain of aliases, if BASE-VARIABLE is
itself an alias.  If NEW-ALIAS is bound, and BASE-VARIABLE is not,
then the value of BASE-VARIABLE is set to that of NEW-ALIAS.
The return value is BASE-VARIABLE.</p>

<h3>Function: custom-save-faces</h3>
Save all customized faces in `custom-file'.<a name="edmacro-mismatch"></a>
<h3>Function: edmacro-mismatch</h3>
Compare SEQ1 with SEQ2, return index of first mismatching element.
Return nil if the sequences match.  If one sequence is a prefix of the
other, the return value indicates the end of the shorted sequence.</p>
<p>
(fn SEQ1 SEQ2 START1 END1 START2 END2)<a name="occur-rename-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: occur-rename-buffer</h3>
Rename the current *Occur* buffer to *Occur: original-buffer-name*.
Here `original-buffer-name' is the buffer name where Occur was originally run.
When given the prefix argument, or called non-interactively, the renaming
will not clobber the existing buffer(s) of that name, but use
`generate-new-buffer-name' instead.  You can add this to `occur-hook'
if you always want a separate *Occur* buffer for each buffer where you
invoke `occur'.<a name="define-mail-abbrev"></a>
<h3>Function: define-mail-abbrev</h3>
Define NAME as a mail alias abbrev that translates to DEFINITION.
If DEFINITION contains multiple addresses, separate them with commas.</p>
<p>
Optional argument FROM-MAILRC-FILE means that DEFINITION comes

spaces and addresses with embedded spaces are surrounded by
double-quotes.</p>
<p>
(fn NAME DEFINITION &optional FROM-MAILRC-FILE)<a name="read-quoted-char"></a>
<h3>Function: read-quoted-char</h3>
Like `read-char', but do not allow quitting.
Also, if the first character read is an octal digit,
we read any number of octal digits and return the
specified character code.  Any nondigit terminates the sequence.
If the terminator is RET, it is discarded;
any other terminator is used itself as input.</p>
<p>
The optional argument PROMPT specifies a string to use to prompt the user.
The variable `read-quoted-char-radix' controls which radix to use
for numeric input.<a name="flycheck-haskell--find-default-directory"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-haskell--find-default-directory</h3>
Come up with a suitable default directory for Haskell to run CHECKER in.</p>
<p>
In case of `haskell-stack-ghc' checker it is directory with
stack.yaml file.  If there's no stack.yaml file in any parent
directory, it will be the directory that "stack path --project-root"
command returns.</p>
<p>
For all other checkers, it is the closest parent directory that
contains a cabal file.<a name="dabbrev--same-major-mode-p"></a>
<h3>Function: dabbrev--same-major-mode-p</h3>
Check if OTHER-BUFFER has the same major mode as current buffer.</p>
<p>
(fn OTHER-BUFFER)<a name="scroll-bar-columns"></a>
<h3>Function: scroll-bar-columns</h3>
Return the width, measured in columns, of the vertical scrollbar on SIDE.
SIDE must be the symbol `left' or `right'.<a name="turn-on-auto-fill"></a>
<h3>Function: turn-on-auto-fill</h3>
Unconditionally turn on Auto Fill mode.<a name="minibuffer-default-add-shell-commands"></a>
<h3>Function: minibuffer-default-add-shell-commands</h3>
Return a list of all commands associated with the current file.
This function is used to add all related commands retrieved by `mailcap'
to the end of the list of defaults just after the default value.<a name="info-standalone"></a>
<h3>Function: info-standalone</h3>
Run Emacs as a standalone Info reader.
Usage:  emacs -f info-standalone [filename]
In standalone mode, q exits Emacs itself.<a name="reset-this-command-lengths"></a>
<h3>Function: reset-this-command-lengths</h3>
Make the unread events replace the last command and echo.
Used in `universal-argument-other-key'.</p>
<p>
`universal-argument-other-key' rereads the event just typed.
It then gets translated through `function-key-map'.
The translated event has to replace the real events,
both in the value of (this-command-keys) and in echoing.
To achieve this, `universal-argument-other-key' calls
`reset-this-command-lengths', which discards the record of reading
these events the first time.</p>

<h3>Function: display-buffer-reuse-window</h3>
Return a window that is already displaying BUFFER.
Return nil if no usable window is found.</p>
<p>
If ALIST has a non-nil `inhibit-same-window' entry, the selected
window is not eligible for reuse.</p>
<p>
If ALIST contains a `reusable-frames' entry, its value determines
which frames to search for a reusable window:
  nil -- the selected frame (actually the last non-minibuffer frame)
  A frame   -- just that frame
  `visible' -- all visible frames
  0   -- all frames on the current terminal
  t   -- all frames.</p>
<p>
If ALIST contains no `reusable-frames' entry, search just the
selected frame if `display-buffer-reuse-frames' and
`pop-up-frames' are both nil; search all frames on the current
terminal if either of those variables is non-nil.</p>
<p>
If ALIST has a non-nil `inhibit-switch-frame' entry, then in the
event that a window on another frame is chosen, avoid raising
that frame.<a name="error"></a>
<h3>Function: error</h3>
Signal an error, making error message by passing all args to `format'.
In Emacs, the convention is that error messages start with a capital
letter but *do not* end with a period.  Please follow this convention
for the sake of consistency.<a name="epl-package-installed-p"></a>
<h3>Function: epl-package-installed-p</h3>

Collect output in a buffer.
While find runs asynchronously, you can use the C-x ` command
to find the text that grep hits refer to.</p>
<p>
This command uses a special history list for its arguments, so you can
easily repeat a find command.</p>
<p>
(fn COMMAND-ARGS)<a name="select-tags-table"></a>
<h3>Function: select-tags-table</h3>
Select a tags table file from a menu of those you have already used.
The list of tags tables to select from is stored in `tags-table-set-list';
see the doc of that variable if you want to add names to the list.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="make-network-process"></a>
<h3>Function: make-network-process</h3>
Create and return a network server or client process.</p>
<p>
In Emacs, network connections are represented by process objects, so
input and output work as for subprocesses and `delete-process' closes
a network connection.  However, a network process has no process id,
it cannot be signaled, and the status codes are different from normal
processes.</p>
<p>
Arguments are specified as keyword/argument pairs.  The following
arguments are defined:</p>
<p>
:name NAME -- NAME is name for process.  It is modified if necessary
to make it unique.</p>
<p>
:buffer BUFFER -- BUFFER is the buffer (or buffer-name) to associate
with the process.  Process output goes at end of that buffer, unless
you specify an output stream or filter function to handle the output.
BUFFER may be also nil, meaning that this process is not associated
with any buffer.</p>
<p>
:host HOST -- HOST is name of the host to connect to, or its IP
address.  The symbol `local' specifies the local host.  If specified
for a server process, it must be a valid name or address for the local
host, and only clients connecting to that address will be accepted.</p>
<p>
:service SERVICE -- SERVICE is name of the service desired, or an
integer specifying a port number to connect to.  If SERVICE is t,
a random port number is selected for the server.  (If Emacs was
compiled with getaddrinfo, a port number can also be specified as a
string, e.g. "80", as well as an integer.  This is not portable.)</p>
<p>
:type TYPE -- TYPE is the type of connection.  The default (nil) is a
stream type connection, `datagram' creates a datagram type connection,
`seqpacket' creates a reliable datagram connection.</p>
<p>
:family FAMILY -- FAMILY is the address (and protocol) family for the
service specified by HOST and SERVICE.  The default (nil) is to use
whatever address family (IPv4 or IPv6) that is defined for the host
and port number specified by HOST and SERVICE.  Other address families
supported are:
  local -- for a local (i.e. UNIX) address specified by SERVICE.
  ipv4  -- use IPv4 address family only.
  ipv6  -- use IPv6 address family only.</p>
<p>
:local ADDRESS -- ADDRESS is the local address used for the connection.
This parameter is ignored when opening a client process. When specified
for a server process, the FAMILY, HOST and SERVICE args are ignored.</p>
<p>
:remote ADDRESS -- ADDRESS is the remote partner's address for the
connection.  This parameter is ignored when opening a stream server
process.  For a datagram server process, it specifies the initial
setting of the remote datagram address.  When specified for a client
process, the FAMILY, HOST, and SERVICE args are ignored.</p>
<p>
The format of ADDRESS depends on the address family:
- An IPv4 address is represented as an vector of integers [A B C D P]
corresponding to numeric IP address A.B.C.D and port number P.
- A local address is represented as a string with the address in the
local address space.
- An "unsupported family" address is represented by a cons (F . AV)
where F is the family number and AV is a vector containing the socket
address data with one element per address data byte.  Do not rely on
this format in portable code, as it may depend on implementation
defined constants, data sizes, and data structure alignment.</p>
<p>
:coding CODING -- If CODING is a symbol, it specifies the coding
system used for both reading and writing for this process.  If CODING
is a cons (DECODING . ENCODING), DECODING is used for reading, and
ENCODING is used for writing.</p>
<p>
:nowait BOOL -- If BOOL is non-nil for a stream type client process,
return without waiting for the connection to complete; instead, the
sentinel function will be called with second arg matching "open" (if
successful) or "failed" when the connect completes.  Default is to use
a blocking connect (i.e. wait) for stream type connections.</p>
<p>
:noquery BOOL -- Query the user unless BOOL is non-nil, and process is
running when Emacs is exited.</p>
<p>
:stop BOOL -- Start process in the `stopped' state if BOOL non-nil.
In the stopped state, a server process does not accept new
connections, and a client process does not handle incoming traffic.
The stopped state is cleared by `continue-process' and set by
`stop-process'.</p>
<p>
:filter FILTER -- Install FILTER as the process filter.</p>
<p>
:filter-multibyte BOOL -- If BOOL is non-nil, strings given to the
process filter are multibyte, otherwise they are unibyte.
If this keyword is not specified, the strings are multibyte if
the default value of `enable-multibyte-characters' is non-nil.</p>
<p>
:sentinel SENTINEL -- Install SENTINEL as the process sentinel.</p>
<p>
:log LOG -- Install LOG as the server process log function.  This
function is called when the server accepts a network connection from a
client.  The arguments are SERVER, CLIENT, and MESSAGE, where SERVER
is the server process, CLIENT is the new process for the connection,
and MESSAGE is a string.</p>
<p>
:plist PLIST -- Install PLIST as the new process' initial plist.</p>
<p>
:server QLEN -- if QLEN is non-nil, create a server process for the
specified FAMILY, SERVICE, and connection type (stream or datagram).
If QLEN is an integer, it is used as the max. length of the server's
pending connection queue (also known as the backlog); the default
queue length is 5.  Default is to create a client process.</p>
<p>
The following network options can be specified for this connection:</p>
<p>
:broadcast BOOL    -- Allow send and receive of datagram broadcasts.
:dontroute BOOL    -- Only send to directly connected hosts.
:keepalive BOOL    -- Send keep-alive messages on network stream.
:linger BOOL or TIMEOUT -- Send queued messages before closing.
:oobinline BOOL    -- Place out-of-band data in receive data stream.
:priority INT      -- Set protocol defined priority for sent packets.
:reuseaddr BOOL    -- Allow reusing a recently used local address
                      (this is allowed by default for a server process).
:bindtodevice NAME -- bind to interface NAME.  Using this may require
                      special privileges on some systems.</p>
<p>
Consult the relevant system programmer's manual pages for more
information on using these options.</p>
<p>

A server process will listen for and accept connections from clients.
When a client connection is accepted, a new network process is created
for the connection with the following parameters:</p>
<p>
- The client's process name is constructed by concatenating the server
process' NAME and a client identification string.
- If the FILTER argument is non-nil, the client process will not get a
separate process buffer; otherwise, the client's process buffer is a newly
created buffer named after the server process' BUFFER name or process
NAME concatenated with the client identification string.
- The connection type and the process filter and sentinel parameters are
inherited from the server process' TYPE, FILTER and SENTINEL.
- The client process' contact info is set according to the client's
addressing information (typically an IP address and a port number).
- The client process' plist is initialized from the server's plist.</p>
<p>
Notice that the FILTER and SENTINEL args are never used directly by
the server process.  Also, the BUFFER argument is not used directly by
the server process, but via the optional :log function, accepted (and
failed) connections may be logged in the server process' buffer.</p>
<p>
The original argument list, modified with the actual connection
information, is available via the `process-contact' function.</p>

The remaining arguments, SPECS, should form a list of faces.
Each list element should be either a face name or a property list
of face attribute/value pairs, like in a `face' text property.</p>
<p>
If SPECS is empty, call `face-remap-reset-base' to use the normal
definition of FACE as the base remapping; note that this is

"foo*.el", with the current file as a default.  Usually this
will be lisp sources, but anything with such hyperlinks can be
checked, including the Emacs .c sources (or the etc/DOC file of
all builtins).</p>
<p>
Because info node hyperlinks are found by a simple regexp search
in the files, the Lisp code checked doesn't have to be loaded,
and links can be in the file commentary or elsewhere too.  Even
.elc files can usually be checked successfully if you don't have
the sources handy.</p>
<p>
(fn FILENAME-LIST)<a name="eshell"></a>
<h3>Function: eshell</h3>
Create an interactive Eshell buffer.
The buffer used for Eshell sessions is determined by the value of
`eshell-buffer-name'.  If there is already an Eshell session active in
that buffer, Emacs will simply switch to it.  Otherwise, a new session
will begin.  A numeric prefix arg (as in `C-u 42 M-x eshell RET')
switches to the session with that number, creating it if necessary.  A
nonnumeric prefix arg means to create a new session.  Returns the
buffer selected (or created).</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="barf-if-buffer-read-only"></a>
<h3>Function: barf-if-buffer-read-only</h3>
Signal a `buffer-read-only' error if the current buffer is read-only.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="ebnf-delete-style"></a>
<h3>Function: ebnf-delete-style</h3>
Delete style NAME.</p>
<p>
See `ebnf-style-database' documentation.</p>
<p>
(fn NAME)<a name="byteorder"></a>
<h3>Function: byteorder</h3>
Return the byteorder for the machine.
Returns 66 (ASCII uppercase B) for big endian machines or 108 (ASCII
lowercase l) for small endian machines.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="mouse-yank-primary"></a>
<h3>Function: mouse-yank-primary</h3>
Insert the primary selection at the position clicked on.
Move point to the end of the inserted text, and set mark at
beginning.  If `mouse-yank-at-point' is non-nil, insert at point
regardless of where you click.</p>
<p>
(fn CLICK)<a name="type-break-guesstimate-keystroke-threshold"></a>
<h3>Function: type-break-guesstimate-keystroke-threshold</h3>
Guess values for the minimum/maximum keystroke threshold for typing breaks.</p>
<p>
If called interactively, the user is prompted for their guess as to how
many words per minute they usually type.  This value should not be your
maximum WPM, but your average.  Of course, this is harder to gauge since it
can vary considerably depending on what you are doing.  For example, one
tends to type less when debugging a program as opposed to writing
documentation.  (Perhaps a separate program should be written to estimate
average typing speed.)</p>
<p>
From that, this command sets the values in `type-break-keystroke-threshold'
based on a fairly simple algorithm involving assumptions about the average
length of words (5).  For the minimum threshold, it uses about a fifth of
the computed maximum threshold.</p>
<p>
When called from Lisp programs, the optional args WORDLEN and FRAC can be
used to override the default assumption about average word length and the
fraction of the maximum threshold to which to set the minimum threshold.
FRAC should be the inverse of the fractional value; for example, a value of
2 would mean to use one half, a value of 4 would mean to use one quarter, etc.</p>
<p>
(fn WPM &optional WORDLEN FRAC)<a name="pr-ps-file-using-ghostscript"></a>
<h3>Function: pr-ps-file-using-ghostscript</h3>
Print PostScript file FILENAME using ghostscript.</p>
<p>
(fn FILENAME)<a name="normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path"></a>
<h3>Function: normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path</h3>
Add all subdirectories of `default-directory' to `load-path'.
More precisely, this uses only the subdirectories whose names
start with letters or digits; it excludes any subdirectory named `RCS'
or `CVS', and any subdirectory that contains a file named `.nosearch'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="memory-limit"></a>
<h3>Function: memory-limit</h3>
Return the address of the last byte Emacs has allocated, divided by 1024.
This may be helpful in debugging Emacs's memory usage.
We divide the value by 1024 to make sure it fits in a Lisp integer.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="bufferp"></a>
<h3>Function: bufferp</h3>
Return t if OBJECT is an editor buffer.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT)<a name="flycheck-hide-error-buffer"></a>

Return the sixth element of the list X.</p>
<p>
(fn X)<a name="Buffer-menu-switch-other-window"></a>
<h3>Function: Buffer-menu-switch-other-window</h3>
Make the other window select this line's buffer.
The current window remains selected.<a name="tabulated-list-print"></a>
<h3>Function: tabulated-list-print</h3>
Populate the current Tabulated List mode buffer.
This sorts the `tabulated-list-entries' list if sorting is
specified by `tabulated-list-sort-key'.  It then erases the
buffer and inserts the entries with `tabulated-list-printer'.</p>
<p>
Optional argument REMEMBER-POS, if non-nil, means to move point
to the entry with the same ID element as the current line.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional REMEMBER-POS)<a name="customize-apropos-options"></a>
<h3>Function: customize-apropos-options</h3>
Customize all loaded customizable options matching REGEXP.<a name="enlarge-window-horizontally"></a>
<h3>Function: enlarge-window-horizontally</h3>
Make selected window DELTA columns wider.
Interactively, if no argument is given, make selected window one
column wider.<a name="make-translation-table-from-alist"></a>
<h3>Function: make-translation-table-from-alist</h3>
Make translation table from N<->M mapping in ALIST.
ALIST is an alist, each element has the form (FROM . TO).
FROM and TO are a character or a vector of characters.
If FROM is a character, that character is translated to TO.
If FROM is a vector of characters, that sequence is translated to TO.
The first extra-slot of the value is a translation table for reverse mapping.<a name="-remove"></a>
<h3>Function: -remove</h3>
Return a new list of the items in LIST for which PRED returns nil.</p>
<p>
Alias: `-reject'</p>
<p>
(fn PRED LIST)<a name="tar-clear-modification-flags"></a>
<h3>Function: tar-clear-modification-flags</h3>
Remove the stars at the beginning of each line.<a name="completion-pcm--find-all-completions"></a>
<h3>Function: completion-pcm--find-all-completions</h3>
Find all completions for STRING at POINT in TABLE, satisfying PRED.
POINT is a position inside STRING.
FILTER is a function applied to the return value, that can be used, e.g. to
filter out additional entries (because TABLE might not obey PRED).</p>
<p>
(fn STRING TABLE PRED POINT &optional FILTER)<a name="latexenc-coding-system-to-inputenc"></a>
<h3>Function: latexenc-coding-system-to-inputenc</h3>
Return the corresponding input encoding for the specified coding system.
Return nil if no matching input encoding can be found.</p>
<p>
(fn CS)<a name="erc-cmd-DCC"></a>
<h3>Function: erc-cmd-DCC</h3>
Parser for /dcc command.
This figures out the dcc subcommand and calls the appropriate routine to
handle it.  The function dispatched should be named "erc-dcc-do-FOO-command",
where FOO is one of CLOSE, GET, SEND, LIST, CHAT, etc.</p>
<p>
(fn CMD &rest ARGS)<a name="cl--defsubst-expand"></a>
<h3>Function: cl--defsubst-expand</h3></p>
<p>

(fn ARGNS BODY SIMPLE WHOLE UNSAFE &rest ARGVS)<a name="ad-disable-advice"></a>
<h3>Function: ad-disable-advice</h3>
Disable the advice of FUNCTION with CLASS and NAME.</p>
<p>
(fn FUNCTION CLASS NAME)<a name="describe-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: describe-mode</h3>
Display documentation of current major mode and minor modes.
A brief summary of the minor modes comes first, followed by the
major mode description.  This is followed by detailed
descriptions of the minor modes, each on a separate page.</p>
<p>
For this to work correctly for a minor mode, the mode's indicator
variable (listed in `minor-mode-alist') must also be a function
whose documentation describes the minor mode.</p>
<p>
If called from Lisp with a non-nil BUFFER argument, display
documentation for the major and minor modes of that buffer.<a name="copy-to-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: copy-to-buffer</h3>
Copy to specified buffer the text of the region.
It is inserted into that buffer, replacing existing text there.</p>
<p>
When calling from a program, give three arguments:
BUFFER (or buffer name), START and END.
START and END specify the portion of the current buffer to be copied.<a name="copy-category-table"></a>
<h3>Function: copy-category-table</h3>
Construct a new category table and return it.
It is a copy of the TABLE, which defaults to the standard category table.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional TABLE)<a name="command-remapping"></a>
<h3>Function: command-remapping</h3>
Return the remapping for command COMMAND.
Returns nil if COMMAND is not remapped (or not a symbol).</p>
<p>
If the optional argument POSITION is non-nil, it specifies a mouse
position as returned by `event-start' and `event-end', and the
remapping occurs in the keymaps associated with it.  It can also be a
number or marker, in which case the keymap properties at the specified
buffer position instead of point are used.  The KEYMAPS argument is
ignored if POSITION is non-nil.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument KEYMAPS is non-nil, it should be a list of
keymaps to search for command remapping.  Otherwise, search for the
remapping in all currently active keymaps.</p>
<p>
(fn COMMAND &optional POSITION KEYMAPS)<a name="fourth"></a>
<h3>Function: fourth</h3>
Return the `car' of the `cdr' of the `cdr' of the `cdr' of X.</p>
<p>
(fn X)<a name="isearch-search-fun-default"></a>
<h3>Function: isearch-search-fun-default</h3>
Return default functions to use for the search.<a name="delete-file-local-variable"></a>
<h3>Function: delete-file-local-variable</h3>
Delete all settings of file-local VARIABLE from the Local Variables list.</p>
<p>
(fn VARIABLE)<a name="debug-on-entry"></a>
<h3>Function: debug-on-entry</h3>
Request FUNCTION to invoke debugger each time it is called.</p>
<p>
When called interactively, prompt for FUNCTION in the minibuffer.</p>
<p>
This works by modifying the definition of FUNCTION.  If you tell the
debugger to continue, FUNCTION's execution proceeds.  If FUNCTION is a
normal function or a macro written in Lisp, you can also step through
its execution.  FUNCTION can also be a primitive that is not a special
form, in which case stepping is not possible.  Break-on-entry for
primitive functions only works when that function is called from Lisp.</p>
<p>
Use M-x cancel-debug-on-entry to cancel the effect of this command.
Redefining FUNCTION also cancels it.<a name="add-to-list"></a>
<h3>Function: add-to-list</h3>
Add ELEMENT to the value of LIST-VAR if it isn't there yet.
The test for presence of ELEMENT is done with `equal',
or with COMPARE-FN if that's non-nil.
If ELEMENT is added, it is added at the beginning of the list,
unless the optional argument APPEND is non-nil, in which case
ELEMENT is added at the end.</p>
<p>
The return value is the new value of LIST-VAR.</p>
<p>
If you want to use `add-to-list' on a variable that is not defined
until a certain package is loaded, you should put the call to `add-to-list'
into a hook function that will be run only after loading the package.
`eval-after-load' provides one way to do this.  In some cases
other hooks, such as major mode hooks, can do the job.<a name="set-match-data"></a>
<h3>Function: set-match-data</h3>
Set internal data on last search match from elements of LIST.
LIST should have been created by calling `match-data' previously.</p>
<p>
If optional arg RESEAT is non-nil, make markers on LIST point nowhere.</p>
<p>
(fn LIST &optional RESEAT)<a name="get-unused-iso-final-char"></a>
<h3>Function: get-unused-iso-final-char</h3>
Return an unused ISO final char for a charset of DIMENSION and CHARS.
DIMENSION is the number of bytes to represent a character: 1 or 2.
CHARS is the number of characters in a dimension: 94 or 96.</p>
<p>
This final char is for private use, thus the range is `0' (48) .. `?' (63).
If there's no unused final char for the specified kind of charset,
return nil.</p>
<p>
(fn DIMENSION CHARS)<a name="fifth"></a>
<h3>Function: fifth</h3>
Return the fifth element of the list X.</p>
<p>
(fn X)<a name="nset-exclusive-or"></a>
<h3>Function: nset-exclusive-or</h3>
Combine LIST1 and LIST2 using a set-exclusive-or operation.
The resulting list contains all items appearing in exactly one of LIST1, LIST2.
This is a destructive function; it reuses the storage of LIST1 and LIST2
whenever possible.</p>
<p>
Keywords supported:  :test :test-not :key</p>
<p>
(fn LIST1 LIST2 [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="read-shell-command"></a>
<h3>Function: read-shell-command</h3>
Read a shell command from the minibuffer.
The arguments are the same as the ones of `read-from-minibuffer',
except READ and KEYMAP are missing and HIST defaults
to `shell-command-history'.<a name="finder-by-keyword"></a>
<h3>Function: finder-by-keyword</h3>
Find packages matching a given keyword.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="delimit-columns-rectangle"></a>
<h3>Function: delimit-columns-rectangle</h3>
Prettify all columns in a text rectangle.</p>
<p>
START and END delimits the corners of text rectangle.</p>
<p>
(fn START END)<a name="comint-postoutput-scroll-to-bottom"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-postoutput-scroll-to-bottom</h3>
Go to the end of buffer in some or all windows showing it.
Do not scroll if the current line is the last line in the buffer.
Depends on the value of `comint-move-point-for-output' and
`comint-scroll-show-maximum-output'.</p>
<p>
This function should be in the list `comint-output-filter-functions'.</p>
<p>
(fn STRING)<a name="select-frame-set-input-focus"></a>
<h3>Function: select-frame-set-input-focus</h3>
Select FRAME, raise it, and set input focus, if possible.
If `mouse-autoselect-window' is non-nil, also move mouse pointer
to FRAME's selected window.  Otherwise, if `focus-follows-mouse'
is non-nil, move mouse cursor to FRAME.</p>
<p>
Optional argument NORECORD means to neither change the order of
recently selected windows nor the buffer list.<a name="count-words-region"></a>
<h3>Function: count-words-region</h3>
Count the number of words in the region.
If called interactively, print a message reporting the number of
lines, words, and characters in the region (whether or not the
region is active); with prefix ARG, report for the entire buffer
rather than the region.</p>
<p>
If called from Lisp, return the number of words between positions
START and END.<a name="flycheck--verify-print-footer"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck--verify-print-footer</h3>
Print a footer for BUFFER in the current buffer.</p>
<p>
BUFFER is the buffer being verified.<a name="quail-define-package"></a>
<h3>Function: quail-define-package</h3>
Define NAME as a new Quail package for input LANGUAGE.
TITLE is a string to be displayed at mode-line to indicate this package.
Optional arguments are GUIDANCE, DOCSTRING, TRANSLATION-KEYS,
 FORGET-LAST-SELECTION, DETERMINISTIC, KBD-TRANSLATE, SHOW-LAYOUT,
 CREATE-DECODE-MAP, MAXIMUM-SHORTEST, OVERLAY-PLIST,
 UPDATE-TRANSLATION-FUNCTION, CONVERSION-KEYS and SIMPLE.</p>
<p>
GUIDANCE specifies how a guidance string is shown in echo area.
If it is t, list of all possible translations for the current key is shown
 with the currently selected translation being highlighted.
If it is an alist, the element has the form (CHAR . STRING).  Each character
 in the current key is searched in the list and the corresponding string is
 shown.
If it is nil, the current key is shown.</p>
<p>
DOCSTRING is the documentation string of this package.  The command
`describe-input-method' shows this string while replacing the form
\<VAR> in the string by the value of VAR.  That value should be a
string.  For instance, the form \<quail-translation-docstring> is
replaced by a description about how to select a translation from a
list of candidates.</p>
<p>
TRANSLATION-KEYS specifies additional key bindings used while translation
region is active.  It is an alist of single key character vs. corresponding
command to be called.</p>
<p>
FORGET-LAST-SELECTION non-nil means a selected translation is not kept
for the future to translate the same key.  If this flag is nil, a
translation selected for a key is remembered so that it can be the
first candidate when the same key is entered later.</p>
<p>
DETERMINISTIC non-nil means the first candidate of translation is
selected automatically without allowing users to select another
translation for a key.  In this case, unselected translations are of
no use for an interactive use of Quail but can be used by some other
programs.  If this flag is non-nil, FORGET-LAST-SELECTION is also set
to t.</p>
<p>
KBD-TRANSLATE non-nil means input characters are translated from a
user's keyboard layout to the standard keyboard layout.  See the
documentation of `quail-keyboard-layout' and
`quail-keyboard-layout-standard' for more detail.</p>
<p>
SHOW-LAYOUT non-nil means the `quail-help' command should show
the user's keyboard layout visually with translated characters.
If KBD-TRANSLATE is set, it is desirable to set also this flag unless
this package defines no translations for single character keys.</p>
<p>
CREATE-DECODE-MAP non-nil means decode map is also created.  A decode
map is an alist of translations and corresponding original keys.
Although this map is not used by Quail itself, it can be used by some
other programs.  For instance, Vietnamese supporting needs this map to
convert Vietnamese text to VIQR format which uses only ASCII
characters to represent Vietnamese characters.</p>
<p>
MAXIMUM-SHORTEST non-nil means break key sequence to get maximum
length of the shortest sequence.  When we don't have a translation of
key "..ABCD" but have translations of "..AB" and "CD..", break
the key at "..AB" and start translation of "CD..".  Hangul
packages, for instance, use this facility.  If this flag is nil, we
break the key just at "..ABC" and start translation of "D..".</p>
<p>
OVERLAY-PLIST if non-nil is a property list put on an overlay which
covers Quail translation region.</p>
<p>
UPDATE-TRANSLATION-FUNCTION if non-nil is a function to call to update
the current translation region according to a new translation data.  By
default, a translated text or a user's key sequence (if no translation
for it) is inserted.</p>
<p>
CONVERSION-KEYS specifies additional key bindings used while
conversion region is active.  It is an alist of single key character
vs. corresponding command to be called.</p>
<p>
If SIMPLE is non-nil, then we do not alter the meanings of
commands such as C-f, C-b, C-n, C-p and TAB; they are treated as
non-Quail commands.</p>
<p>
(fn NAME LANGUAGE TITLE &optional GUIDANCE DOCSTRING TRANSLATION-KEYS FORGET-LAST-SELECTION DETERMINISTIC KBD-TRANSLATE SHOW-LAYOUT CREATE-DECODE-MAP MAXIMUM-SHORTEST OVERLAY-PLIST UPDATE-TRANSLATION-FUNCTION CONVERSION-KEYS SIMPLE)<a name="find-cmd"></a>
<h3>Function: find-cmd</h3>
Initiate the building of a find command.
For example:</p>
<p>
(find-cmd '(prune (name ".svn" ".git" ".CVS"))
          '(and (or (name "*.pl" "*.pm" "*.t")
                    (mtime "+1"))
                (fstype "nfs" "ufs"))))</p>
<p>
`default-directory' is used as the initial search path.  The
result is a string that should be ready for the command line.</p>
<p>
(fn &rest SUBFINDS)<a name="objc-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: objc-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing Objective C code.
To submit a problem report, enter `M-x c-submit-bug-report' from an
objc-mode buffer.  This automatically sets up a mail buffer with
version information already added.  You just need to add a description
of the problem, including a reproducible test case, and send the
message.</p>
<p>
To see what version of CC Mode you are running, enter `M-x c-version'.</p>
<p>
The hook `c-mode-common-hook' is run with no args at mode
initialization, then `objc-mode-hook'.</p>
<p>
Key bindings:</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `objc-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

(fn)<a name="button-type-put"></a>
<h3>Function: button-type-put</h3>
Set the button-type TYPE's PROP property to VAL.<a name="make-composed-keymap"></a>
<h3>Function: make-composed-keymap</h3>
Construct a new keymap composed of MAPS and inheriting from PARENT.
When looking up a key in the returned map, the key is looked in each
keymap of MAPS in turn until a binding is found.
If no binding is found in MAPS, the lookup continues in PARENT, if non-nil.
As always with keymap inheritance, a nil binding in MAPS overrides
any corresponding binding in PARENT, but it does not override corresponding
bindings in other keymaps of MAPS.
MAPS can be a list of keymaps or a single keymap.
PARENT if non-nil should be a keymap.<a name="dired-flag-backup-files"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-flag-backup-files</h3>
Flag all backup files (names ending with `~') for deletion.
With prefix argument, unmark or unflag these files.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional UNFLAG-P)<a name="vc-git--run-command-string"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-git--run-command-string</h3>
Run a git command on FILE and return its output as string.
FILE can be nil.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE &rest ARGS)<a name="how-many"></a>
<h3>Function: how-many</h3>
Print and return number of matches for REGEXP following point.
When called from Lisp and INTERACTIVE is omitted or nil, just return
the number, do not print it; if INTERACTIVE is t, the function behaves
in all respects as if it had been called interactively.</p>
<p>
If REGEXP contains upper case characters (excluding those preceded by `\')
and `search-upper-case' is non-nil, the matching is case-sensitive.</p>
<p>
Second and third arg RSTART and REND specify the region to operate on.</p>
<p>
Interactively, in Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, operate
on the contents of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the
end of (the accessible portion of) the buffer.</p>
<p>
This function starts looking for the next match from the end of
the previous match.  Hence, it ignores matches that overlap
a previously found match.<a name="checkdoc-ispell-current-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: checkdoc-ispell-current-buffer</h3>
Check the style and spelling of the current buffer.
Calls `checkdoc-current-buffer' with spell-checking turned on.
Prefix argument TAKE-NOTES is the same as for `checkdoc-current-buffer'</p>
<p>
(fn &optional TAKE-NOTES)<a name="case-table-p"></a>
<h3>Function: case-table-p</h3>
Return t if OBJECT is a case table.
See `set-case-table' for more information on these data structures.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT)<a name="flycheck-disable-excessive-checker"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-disable-excessive-checker</h3>
Disable CHECKER if it reported excessive ERRORS.</p>
<p>
If ERRORS has more items than `flycheck-checker-error-threshold',
add CHECKER to `flycheck-disabled-checkers', and show a warning.</p>
<p>
Return t when CHECKER was disabled, or nil otherwise.<a name="lm-get-header-re"></a>
<h3>Function: lm-get-header-re</h3>
Return regexp for matching HEADER.
If called with optional MODE and with value `section',
return section regexp instead.<a name="auth-source-forget+"></a>
<h3>Function: auth-source-forget+</h3>
Forget any cached data matching SPEC.  Returns forgotten count.</p>
<p>
This is not a full `auth-source-search' spec but works similarly.
For instance, (:host "myhost" "yourhost") would find all the
cached data that was found with a search for those two hosts,
while (:host t) would find all host entries.</p>
<p>
(fn &rest SPEC &allow-other-keys)<a name="tty-color-off-gray-diag"></a>
<h3>Function: tty-color-off-gray-diag</h3>
Compute the angle between the color given by R,G,B and the gray diagonal.
The gray diagonal is the diagonal of the 3D cube in RGB space which
connects the points corresponding to the black and white colors.  All the
colors whose RGB coordinates belong to this diagonal are various shades
of gray, thus the name.<a name="set-language-environment-unibyte"></a>
<h3>Function: set-language-environment-unibyte</h3>
Do various unibyte-mode setups for language environment LANGUAGE-NAME.<a name="url-is-cached"></a>
<h3>Function: url-is-cached</h3>
Return non-nil if the URL is cached.
The actual return value is the last modification time of the cache file.<a name="ada-add-extensions"></a>
<h3>Function: ada-add-extensions</h3>
Define SPEC and BODY as being valid extensions for Ada files.
Going from body to spec with `ff-find-other-file' used these
extensions.
SPEC and BODY are two regular expressions that must match against
the file name.</p>
<p>
(fn SPEC BODY)<a name="ispell-valid-dictionary-list"></a>
<h3>Function: ispell-valid-dictionary-list</h3>
Return a list of valid dictionaries.
The variable `ispell-library-directory' defines their location.<a name="vc-git-retrieve-tag"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-git-retrieve-tag</h3></p>
<p>

(fn DIR NAME UPDATE)<a name="comint-read-input-ring"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-read-input-ring</h3>
Set the buffer's `comint-input-ring' from a history file.
The name of the file is given by the variable `comint-input-ring-file-name'.
The history ring is of size `comint-input-ring-size', regardless of file size.
If `comint-input-ring-file-name' is nil this function does nothing.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument SILENT is non-nil, we say nothing about a
failure to read the history file.</p>
<p>
This function is useful for major mode commands and mode hooks.</p>
<p>
The commands stored in the history file are separated by the
`comint-input-ring-separator', and entries that match
`comint-input-history-ignore' are ignored.  The most recent command
comes last.</p>
<p>
See also `comint-input-ignoredups' and `comint-write-input-ring'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional SILENT)<a name="todo-top-priorities"></a>
<h3>Function: todo-top-priorities</h3>
List top priorities for each category.</p>
<p>
Number of entries for each category is given by NOF-PRIORITIES which
defaults to `todo-show-priorities'.</p>
<p>
If CATEGORY-PR-PAGE is non-nil, a page separator '^L' is inserted
between each category.
INTERACTIVE should be non-nil if this function is called interactively.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional NOF-PRIORITIES CATEGORY-PR-PAGE INTERACTIVE)<a name="global-hi-lock-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: global-hi-lock-mode</h3>
Toggle Hi-Lock mode in all buffers.
With prefix ARG, enable Global-Hi-Lock mode if ARG is positive;
otherwise, disable it.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode if
ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Hi-Lock mode is enabled in all buffers where
`turn-on-hi-lock-if-enabled' would do it.
See `hi-lock-mode' for more information on Hi-Lock mode.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="set-window-start"></a>
<h3>Function: set-window-start</h3>
Make display in WINDOW start at position POS in WINDOW's buffer.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.  Return
POS.  Optional third arg NOFORCE non-nil inhibits next redisplay from
overriding motion of point in order to display at this exact start.</p>

<h3>Function: dired-do-create-files</h3>
Create a new file for each marked file.
Prompt user for a target directory in which to create the new
  files.  The target may also be a non-directory file, if only
  one file is marked.  The initial suggestion for target is the
  Dired buffer's current directory (or, if `dired-dwim-target' is
  non-nil, the current directory of a neighboring Dired window).
OP-SYMBOL is the symbol for the operation.  Function `dired-mark-pop-up'
  will determine whether pop-ups are appropriate for this OP-SYMBOL.
FILE-CREATOR and OPERATION as in `dired-create-files'.
ARG as in `dired-get-marked-files'.
Optional arg MARKER-CHAR as in `dired-create-files'.
Optional arg OP1 is an alternate form for OPERATION if there is
  only one file.
Optional arg HOW-TO determines how to treat the target.
  If HOW-TO is nil, use `file-directory-p' to determine if the
   target is a directory.  If so, the marked file(s) are created
   inside that directory.  Otherwise, the target is a plain file;
   an error is raised unless there is exactly one marked file.
  If HOW-TO is t, target is always treated as a plain file.
  Otherwise, HOW-TO should be a function of one argument, TARGET.
   If its return value is nil, TARGET is regarded as a plain file.
   If it return value is a list, TARGET is a generalized
    directory (e.g. some sort of archive).  The first element of
    this list must be a function with at least four arguments:
      operation - as OPERATION above.
      rfn-list  - list of the relative names for the marked files.
      fn-list   - list of the absolute names for the marked files.
      target    - the name of the target itself.
      The rest of into-dir are optional arguments.
   For any other return value, TARGET is treated as a directory.<a name="list-buffers-noselect"></a>

PROGRAM should be either a string denoting an executable program to create
via `start-file-process', or a cons pair of the form (HOST . SERVICE) denoting
a TCP connection to be opened via `open-network-stream'.  If there is already
a running process in that buffer, it is not restarted.  Optional third arg
STARTFILE is the name of a file, whose contents are sent to the
process as its initial input.</p>
<p>
If PROGRAM is a string, any more args are arguments to PROGRAM.</p>

(A negative argument kills backward.)
If you use this command with a prefix argument to kill the line
for a file that is a directory, which you have inserted in the
Dired buffer as a subdirectory, then it deletes that subdirectory
from the buffer as well.
To kill an entire subdirectory (without killing its line in the
parent directory), go to its directory header line and use this
command with a prefix argument (the value does not matter).<a name="vc-git--state-code"></a>

(fn ARG)<a name="plain-tex-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: plain-tex-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing files of input for plain TeX.
Makes $ and } display the characters they match.
Makes " insert `` when it seems to be the beginning of a quotation,
and '' when it appears to be the end; it inserts " only after a \.</p>
<p>
Use M-x tex-region to run TeX on the current region, plus a "header"
copied from the top of the file (containing macro definitions, etc.),
running TeX under a special subshell.  M-x tex-buffer does the whole buffer.
M-x tex-file saves the buffer and then processes the file.
M-x tex-print prints the .dvi file made by any of these.
M-x tex-view previews the .dvi file made by any of these.
M-x tex-bibtex-file runs bibtex on the file of the current buffer.</p>
<p>
Use M-x tex-validate-buffer to check buffer for paragraphs containing
mismatched $'s or braces.</p>
<p>
Special commands:</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `plain-tex-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

Mode variables:
tex-run-command
	Command string used by M-x tex-region or M-x tex-buffer.
tex-directory
	Directory in which to create temporary files for TeX jobs
	run by M-x tex-region or M-x tex-buffer.
tex-dvi-print-command
	Command string used by M-x tex-print to print a .dvi file.
tex-alt-dvi-print-command
	Alternative command string used by M-x tex-print (when given a prefix
	argument) to print a .dvi file.
tex-dvi-view-command
	Command string used by M-x tex-view to preview a .dvi file.
tex-show-queue-command
	Command string used by M-x tex-show-print-queue to show the print
	queue that M-x tex-print put your job on.</p>
<p>
Entering Plain-tex mode runs the hook `text-mode-hook', then the hook
`tex-mode-hook', and finally the hook `plain-tex-mode-hook'.  When the
special subshell is initiated, the hook `tex-shell-hook' is run.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="generic-make-keywords-list"></a>
<h3>Function: generic-make-keywords-list</h3>
Return a `font-lock-keywords' construct that highlights KEYWORD-LIST.
KEYWORD-LIST is a list of keyword strings that should be
highlighted with face FACE.  This function calculates a regular
expression that matches these keywords and concatenates it with
PREFIX and SUFFIX.  Then it returns a construct based on this
regular expression that can be used as an element of
`font-lock-keywords'.</p>
<p>
(fn KEYWORD-LIST FACE &optional PREFIX SUFFIX)<a name="encode-hz-region"></a>
<h3>Function: encode-hz-region</h3>
Encode the text in the current region to HZ.
Return the length of resulting text.</p>
<p>
(fn BEG END)<a name="delete-blank-lines"></a>
<h3>Function: delete-blank-lines</h3>
On blank line, delete all surrounding blank lines, leaving just one.
On isolated blank line, delete that one.
On nonblank line, delete any immediately following blank lines.<a name="flycheck-error-message-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-error-message-buffer</h3>
Get the buffer object to show long error messages in.</p>
<p>
Get the buffer named by variable `flycheck-error-message-buffer',
or nil if the buffer does not exist.<a name="-copy"></a>
<h3>Function: -copy</h3>
Create a shallow copy of LIST.<a name="pcomplete-match-end"></a>
<h3>Function: pcomplete-match-end</h3>
Return position of end of text matched by last search.
SUBEXP, a number, specifies which parenthesized expression in the last
  regexp.
Value is nil if SUBEXPth pair didn't match, or there were less than
  SUBEXP pairs.
Zero means the entire text matched by the whole regexp or whole string.</p>
<p>
(fn SUBEXP)<a name="hi-lock-face-phrase-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: hi-lock-face-phrase-buffer</h3>
Set face of each match of phrase REGEXP to FACE.
If called interactively, replaces whitespace in REGEXP with
arbitrary whitespace and makes initial lower-case letters case-insensitive.</p>
<p>
If Font Lock mode is enabled in the buffer, it is used to
highlight REGEXP.  If Font Lock mode is disabled, overlays are
used for highlighting; in this case, the highlighting will not be
updated as you type.</p>
<p>
(fn REGEXP &optional FACE)<a name="gnus-cache-generate-nov-databases"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-cache-generate-nov-databases</h3>
Generate NOV files recursively starting in DIR.</p>
<p>
(fn DIR)<a name="ffap-next"></a>
<h3>Function: ffap-next</h3>
Search buffer for next file or URL, and run ffap.
Optional argument BACK says to search backwards.
Optional argument WRAP says to try wrapping around if necessary.
Interactively: use a single prefix to search backwards,
double prefix to wrap forward, triple to wrap backwards.
Actual search is done by `ffap-next-guess'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional BACK WRAP)<a name="set-mark-command"></a>
<h3>Function: set-mark-command</h3>
Set the mark where point is, or jump to the mark.
Setting the mark also alters the region, which is the text
between point and mark; this is the closest equivalent in
Emacs to what some editors call the "selection".</p>
<p>
With no prefix argument, set the mark at point, and push the
old mark position on local mark ring.  Also push the old mark on
global mark ring, if the previous mark was set in another buffer.</p>
<p>
When Transient Mark Mode is off, immediately repeating this
command activates `transient-mark-mode' temporarily.</p>
<p>
With prefix argument (e.g., C-u C-SPC), jump to the mark, and set the mark from
position popped off the local mark ring (this does not affect the global
mark ring).  Use C-x C-@ to jump to a mark popped off the global
mark ring (see `pop-global-mark').</p>
<p>
If `set-mark-command-repeat-pop' is non-nil, repeating
the C-SPC command with no prefix argument pops the next position
off the local (or global) mark ring and jumps there.</p>
<p>
With C-u C-u as prefix
argument, unconditionally set mark where point is, even if
`set-mark-command-repeat-pop' is non-nil.</p>
<p>
Novice Emacs Lisp programmers often try to use the mark for the wrong
purposes.  See the documentation of `set-mark' for more information.<a name="copy-directory"></a>
<h3>Function: copy-directory</h3>
Copy DIRECTORY to NEWNAME.  Both args must be strings.
This function always sets the file modes of the output files to match
the corresponding input file.</p>
<p>
The third arg KEEP-TIME non-nil means give the output files the same
last-modified time as the old ones.  (This works on only some systems.)</p>
<p>
A prefix arg makes KEEP-TIME non-nil.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, the last argument PARENTS says whether to
create parent directories if they don't exist.  Interactively,
this happens by default.</p>
<p>
If NEWNAME names an existing directory, copy DIRECTORY as a
subdirectory there.  However, if called from Lisp with a non-nil
optional argument COPY-CONTENTS, copy the contents of DIRECTORY
directly into NEWNAME instead.<a name="apropos-true-hit"></a>
<h3>Function: apropos-true-hit</h3>
Return t if STR is a genuine hit.
This may fail if only one of the keywords is matched more than once.
This requires that at least 2 keywords (unless only one was given).<a name="vc-git-checkout"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-git-checkout</h3></p>
<p>

(fn FILE &optional EDITABLE REV)<a name="shell-dynamic-complete-command"></a>
<h3>Function: shell-dynamic-complete-command</h3>
Dynamically complete the command at point.
This function is similar to `comint-dynamic-complete-filename', except that it
searches `exec-path' (minus the trailing Emacs library path) for completion
candidates.  Note that this may not be the same as the shell's idea of the
path.</p>
<p>
Completion is dependent on the value of `shell-completion-execonly', plus
those that effect file completion.</p>
<p>
Returns t if successful.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="third"></a>
<h3>Function: third</h3>
Return the `car' of the `cdr' of the `cdr' of X.</p>
<p>
(fn X)<a name="pcomplete/gzip"></a>
<h3>Function: pcomplete/gzip</h3>
Completion for `gzip'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="make-mode-line-mouse-map"></a>
<h3>Function: make-mode-line-mouse-map</h3>
Return a keymap with single entry for mouse key MOUSE on the mode line.
MOUSE is defined to run function FUNCTION with no args in the buffer
corresponding to the mode line clicked.<a name="make-category-set"></a>
<h3>Function: make-category-set</h3>
Return a newly created category-set which contains CATEGORIES.
CATEGORIES is a string of category mnemonics.
The value is a bool-vector which has t at the indices corresponding to
those categories.</p>
<p>
(fn CATEGORIES)<a name="epl-package-from-lisp-file"></a>
<h3>Function: epl-package-from-lisp-file</h3>
Parse the package headers the file at FILE-NAME.</p>
<p>
Return an `epl-package' object with the header metadata.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE-NAME)<a name="nth-value"></a>
<h3>Function: nth-value</h3>
Return the Nth element of LIST.
N counts from zero.  If LIST is not that long, nil is returned.</p>
<p>
(fn N LIST)<a name="window-max-delta"></a>
<h3>Function: window-max-delta</h3>
Return maximum number of lines by which WINDOW can be enlarged.
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.
The return value is zero if WINDOW cannot be enlarged.</p>
<p>
Optional argument HORIZONTAL non-nil means return maximum number
of columns by which WINDOW can be enlarged.</p>
<p>
Optional argument IGNORE non-nil means ignore restrictions
imposed by fixed size windows, `window-min-height' or
`window-min-width' settings.  If IGNORE is a window, ignore
restrictions for that window only.  If IGNORE equals `safe',
live windows may get as small as `window-safe-min-height' lines
and `window-safe-min-width' columns.  Any other non-nil value means
ignore all of the above restrictions for all windows.</p>
<p>
Optional argument TRAIL restricts the windows that can be enlarged.
If its value is `before', only windows to the left of or above WINDOW
can be enlarged.  If it is `after', only windows to the right of or
below WINDOW can be enlarged.</p>
<p>
Optional argument NOUP non-nil means don't go up in the window
tree but try to obtain the entire space from windows within
WINDOW's combination.</p>
<p>
Optional argument NODOWN non-nil means do not check whether
WINDOW itself (and its child windows) can be enlarged; check
only whether other windows can be shrunk appropriately.<a name="show-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: show-buffer</h3>
Make WINDOW display BUFFER-OR-NAME as its contents.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.
BUFFER-OR-NAME must be a buffer or the name of an existing buffer.</p>
<p>
Optional third argument KEEP-MARGINS non-nil means that WINDOW's current
display margins, fringe widths, and scroll bar settings are preserved;
the default is to reset these from the local settings for BUFFER-OR-NAME
or the frame defaults.  Return nil.</p>
<p>
This function throws an error when WINDOW is strongly dedicated to its
buffer (that is `window-dedicated-p' returns t for WINDOW) and does not
already display BUFFER-OR-NAME.</p>
<p>
This function runs `window-scroll-functions' before running
`window-configuration-change-hook'.</p>
<p>
(fn WINDOW BUFFER-OR-NAME &optional KEEP-MARGINS)<a name="window-dedicated-p"></a>
<h3>Function: window-dedicated-p</h3>
Return non-nil when WINDOW is dedicated to its buffer.
More precisely, return the value assigned by the last call of
`set-window-dedicated-p' for WINDOW.  Return nil if that function was
never called with WINDOW as its argument, or the value set by that
function was internally reset since its last call.  WINDOW must be a
live window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
When a window is dedicated to its buffer, `display-buffer' will refrain
from displaying another buffer in it.  `get-lru-window' and
`get-largest-window' treat dedicated windows specially.
`delete-windows-on', `replace-buffer-in-windows', `quit-window' and
`kill-buffer' can delete a dedicated window and the containing frame.</p>
<p>
Functions like `set-window-buffer' may change the buffer displayed by a
window, unless that window is "strongly" dedicated to its buffer, that
is the value returned by `window-dedicated-p' is t.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WINDOW)<a name="object-name"></a>
<h3>Function: object-name</h3>
Return a Lisp like symbol string for object OBJ.
If EXTRA, include that in the string returned to represent the symbol.<a name="substitute-if"></a>
<h3>Function: substitute-if</h3>
Substitute NEW for all items satisfying PREDICATE in SEQ.
This is a non-destructive function; it makes a copy of SEQ if necessary
to avoid corrupting the original SEQ.</p>
<p>
Keywords supported:  :key :count :start :end :from-end</p>
<p>
(fn NEW PREDICATE SEQ [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="url-retrieve"></a>
<h3>Function: url-retrieve</h3>
Retrieve URL asynchronously and call CALLBACK with CBARGS when finished.
URL is either a string or a parsed URL.  If it is a string
containing characters that are not valid in a URI, those
characters are percent-encoded; see `url-encode-url'.</p>
<p>
CALLBACK is called when the object has been completely retrieved, with
the current buffer containing the object, and any MIME headers associated
with it.  It is called as (apply CALLBACK STATUS CBARGS).
STATUS is a plist representing what happened during the request,
with most recent events first, or an empty list if no events have
occurred.  Each pair is one of:</p>
<p>
(:redirect REDIRECTED-TO) - the request was redirected to this URL
(:error (ERROR-SYMBOL . DATA)) - an error occurred.  The error can be
signaled with (signal ERROR-SYMBOL DATA).</p>
<p>
Return the buffer URL will load into, or nil if the process has
already completed (i.e. URL was a mailto URL or similar; in this case
the callback is not called).</p>
<p>
The variables `url-request-data', `url-request-method' and
`url-request-extra-headers' can be dynamically bound around the
request; dynamic binding of other variables doesn't necessarily
take effect.</p>
<p>
If SILENT, then don't message progress reports and the like.
If INHIBIT-COOKIES, cookies will neither be stored nor sent to
the server.
If URL is a multibyte string, it will be encoded as utf-8 and
URL-encoded before it's used.</p>

<h3>Function: face-valid-attribute-values</h3>
Return valid values for face attribute ATTRIBUTE.
The optional argument FRAME is used to determine available fonts
and colors.  If it is nil or not specified, the selected frame is used.
Value is an alist of (NAME . VALUE) if ATTRIBUTE expects a value out
of a set of discrete values.  Value is `integerp' if ATTRIBUTE expects
an integer value.<a name="recursion-depth"></a>
<h3>Function: recursion-depth</h3>
Return the current depth in recursive edits.</p>
<p>

Ask Mozilla/Netscape to load URL via the GNOME program `gnome-moz-remote'.
Default to the URL around or before point.  The strings in variable
`browse-url-gnome-moz-arguments' are also passed.</p>
<p>
When called interactively, if variable `browse-url-new-window-flag' is
non-nil, load the document in a new browser window, otherwise use an
existing one.  A non-nil interactive prefix argument reverses the
effect of `browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
When called non-interactively, optional second argument NEW-WINDOW is
used instead of `browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
(fn URL &optional NEW-WINDOW)<a name="open-termscript"></a>
<h3>Function: open-termscript</h3>
Start writing all terminal output to FILE as well as the terminal.

<p>
(fn LIST)<a name="shadow-define-literal-group"></a>
<h3>Function: shadow-define-literal-group</h3>
Declare a single file to be shared between sites.
It may have different filenames on each site.  When this file is edited, the
new version will be copied to each of the other locations.  Sites can be
specific hostnames, or names of clusters (see `shadow-define-cluster').</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="ispell-process-line"></a>
<h3>Function: ispell-process-line</h3>
Send STRING, a line of text, to ispell and process the result.

- prefer INDENT (or `comment-column' if nil).
Point is expected to be at the start of the comment.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional INDENT)<a name="whitespace-cleanup"></a>
<h3>Function: whitespace-cleanup</h3>
Cleanup some blank problems in all buffer or at region.</p>
<p>
It usually applies to the whole buffer, but in transient mark
mode when the mark is active, it applies to the region.  It also
applies to the region when it is not in transient mark mode, the
mark is active and C-u was pressed just before
calling `whitespace-cleanup' interactively.</p>
<p>
See also `whitespace-cleanup-region'.</p>
<p>
The problems cleaned up are:</p>
<p>
1. empty lines at beginning of buffer.
2. empty lines at end of buffer.
   If `whitespace-style' includes the value `empty', remove all
   empty lines at beginning and/or end of buffer.</p>
<p>
3. 8 or more SPACEs at beginning of line.
   If `whitespace-style' includes the value `indentation':
   replace 8 or more SPACEs at beginning of line by TABs, if
   `indent-tabs-mode' is non-nil; otherwise, replace TABs by
   SPACEs.
   If `whitespace-style' includes the value `indentation::tab',
   replace 8 or more SPACEs at beginning of line by TABs.
   If `whitespace-style' includes the value `indentation::space',
   replace TABs by SPACEs.</p>
<p>
4. SPACEs before TAB.
   If `whitespace-style' includes the value `space-before-tab':
   replace SPACEs by TABs, if `indent-tabs-mode' is non-nil;
   otherwise, replace TABs by SPACEs.
   If `whitespace-style' includes the value
   `space-before-tab::tab', replace SPACEs by TABs.
   If `whitespace-style' includes the value
   `space-before-tab::space', replace TABs by SPACEs.</p>
<p>
5. SPACEs or TABs at end of line.
   If `whitespace-style' includes the value `trailing', remove
   all SPACEs or TABs at end of line.</p>
<p>
6. 8 or more SPACEs after TAB.
   If `whitespace-style' includes the value `space-after-tab':
   replace SPACEs by TABs, if `indent-tabs-mode' is non-nil;
   otherwise, replace TABs by SPACEs.
   If `whitespace-style' includes the value
   `space-after-tab::tab', replace SPACEs by TABs.
   If `whitespace-style' includes the value
   `space-after-tab::space', replace TABs by SPACEs.</p>
<p>
See `whitespace-style', `indent-tabs-mode' and `tab-width' for
documentation.</p>

(fn)<a name="window--resizable-p"></a>
<h3>Function: window--resizable-p</h3>
Return t if WINDOW can be resized vertically by DELTA lines.
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.
For the meaning of the arguments of this function see the
doc-string of `window--resizable'.<a name="flycheck-handle-signal"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-handle-signal</h3>
Handle a signal from the syntax checking PROCESS.</p>
<p>
_EVENT is ignored.<a name="send-invisible"></a>
<h3>Function: send-invisible</h3>
Read a string without echoing.
Then send it to the process running in the current buffer.
The string is sent using `comint-input-sender'.
Security bug: your string can still be temporarily recovered with
C-h l; `clear-this-command-keys' can fix that.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional PROMPT)<a name="tpu-mapper"></a>
<h3>Function: tpu-mapper</h3>
Create an Emacs lisp file defining the TPU-edt keypad for X-windows.</p>
<p>
This command displays an instruction screen showing the TPU-edt keypad
and asks you to press the TPU-edt editing keys.  It uses the keys you
press to create an Emacs Lisp file that will define a TPU-edt keypad
for your X server.  You can even re-arrange the standard EDT keypad to
suit your tastes (or to cope with those silly Sun and PC keypads).</p>
<p>
Finally, you will be prompted for the name of the file to store the key
definitions.  If you chose the default, TPU-edt will find it and load it
automatically.  If you specify a different file name, you will need to
set the variable ``tpu-xkeys-file'' before starting TPU-edt.  Here's how
you might go about doing that in your init file.</p>
<p>
  (setq tpu-xkeys-file (expand-file-name "~/.my-emacs-x-keys"))
  (tpu-edt)</p>
<p>
Known Problems:</p>
<p>
Sometimes, tpu-mapper will ignore a key you press, and just continue to
prompt for the same key.  This can happen when your window manager sucks
up the key and doesn't pass it on to Emacs, or it could be an Emacs bug.
Either way, there's nothing that tpu-mapper can do about it.  You must
press RETURN, to skip the current key and continue.  Later, you and/or
your local X guru can try to figure out why the key is being ignored.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="rng-xsd-compile"></a>
<h3>Function: rng-xsd-compile</h3>
Provides W3C XML Schema as a RELAX NG datatypes library.
NAME is a symbol giving the local name of the datatype.  PARAMS is a
list of pairs (PARAM-NAME . PARAM-VALUE) where PARAM-NAME is a symbol
giving the name of the parameter and PARAM-VALUE is a string giving
its value.  If NAME or PARAMS are invalid, it calls rng-dt-error
passing it arguments in the same style as format; the value from
rng-dt-error will be returned.  Otherwise, it returns a list.  The
first member of the list is t if any string is a legal value for the
datatype and nil otherwise.  The second argument is a symbol; this
symbol will be called as a function passing it a string followed by
the remaining members of the list.  The function must return an object
representing the value of the datatype that was represented by the
string, or nil if the string is not a representation of any value.
The object returned can be any convenient non-nil value, provided
that, if two strings represent the same value, the returned objects
must be equal.</p>
<p>
(fn NAME PARAMS)<a name="delete-other-windows-internal"></a>
<h3>Function: delete-other-windows-internal</h3>
Make WINDOW fill its frame.
Only the frame WINDOW is on is affected.  WINDOW must be a valid window

<p>
Optional argument ROOT, if non-nil, must specify an internal window such
that WINDOW is in its window subtree.  If this is the case, replace ROOT
by WINDOW and leave alone any windows not part of ROOT's subtree.</p>
<p>
When WINDOW is live try to reduce display jumps by keeping the text
previously visible in WINDOW in the same place on the frame.  Doing this
depends on the value of (window-start WINDOW), so if calling this
function in a program gives strange scrolling, make sure the
window-start value is reasonable when this function is called.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WINDOW ROOT)<a name="mouse-delete-window"></a>

preempted by arriving input, so FORCE does nothing.</p>
<p>
Return t if redisplay was performed, nil if redisplay was preempted
immediately by pending input.</p>

Normally, return a network process object; with a non-nil
:return-list parameter, return a list instead (see below).
Input and output work as for subprocesses; `delete-process'
closes it.</p>
<p>
NAME is the name for the process.  It is modified if necessary to
 make it unique.
BUFFER is a buffer or buffer name to associate with the process.
 Process output goes at end of that buffer.  BUFFER may be nil,
 meaning that the process is not associated with any buffer.
HOST is the name or IP address of the host to connect to.
SERVICE is the name of the service desired, or an integer specifying
 a port number to connect to.</p>
<p>
The remaining PARAMETERS should be a sequence of keywords and
values:</p>
<p>
:type specifies the connection type, one of the following:
  nil or `network'
             -- Begin with an ordinary network connection, and if
                the parameters :success and :capability-command
                are also supplied, try to upgrade to an encrypted
                connection via STARTTLS.  Even if that
                fails (e.g. if HOST does not support TLS), retain
                an unencrypted connection.
  `plain'    -- An ordinary, unencrypted network connection.
  `starttls' -- Begin with an ordinary connection, and try
                upgrading via STARTTLS.  If that fails for any
                reason, drop the connection; in that case the
                returned object is a killed process.
  `tls'      -- A TLS connection.
  `ssl'      -- Equivalent to `tls'.
  `shell'    -- A shell connection.</p>
<p>
:return-list specifies this function's return value.
  If omitted or nil, return a process object.  A non-nil means to
  return (PROC . PROPS), where PROC is a process object and PROPS
  is a plist of connection properties, with these keywords:
   :greeting -- the greeting returned by HOST (a string), or nil.
   :capabilities -- a string representing HOST's capabilities,
                    or nil if none could be found.
   :type -- the resulting connection type; `plain' (unencrypted)
            or `tls' (TLS-encrypted).</p>
<p>
:end-of-command specifies a regexp matching the end of a command.</p>
<p>
:end-of-capability specifies a regexp matching the end of the
  response to the command specified for :capability-command.
  It defaults to the regexp specified for :end-of-command.</p>
<p>
:success specifies a regexp matching a message indicating a
  successful STARTTLS negotiation.  For instance, the default
  should be "^3" for an NNTP connection.</p>
<p>
:capability-command specifies a command used to query the HOST
  for its capabilities.  For instance, for IMAP this should be
  "1 CAPABILITY\r\n".</p>
<p>
:starttls-function specifies a function for handling STARTTLS.
  This function should take one parameter, the response to the
  capability command, and should return the command to switch on
  STARTTLS if the server supports STARTTLS, and nil otherwise.</p>
<p>
:always-query-capabilities says whether to query the server for
  capabilities, even if we're doing a `plain' network connection.</p>
<p>
:client-certificate should either be a list where the first
  element is the certificate key file name, and the second
  element is the certificate file name itself, or `t', which
  means that `auth-source' will be queried for the key and the
  certificate.  This parameter will only be used when doing TLS
  or STARTTLS connections.</p>
<p>
:use-starttls-if-possible is a boolean that says to do opportunistic
STARTTLS upgrades even if Emacs doesn't have built-in TLS functionality.</p>
<p>
:nowait is a boolean that says the connection should be made
  asynchronously, if possible.<a name="tty-type"></a>
<h3>Function: tty-type</h3>
Return the type of the tty device that TERMINAL uses.
Returns nil if TERMINAL is not on a tty device.</p>
<p>
TERMINAL can be a terminal object, a frame, or nil (meaning the
selected frame's terminal).</p>
<p>
(fn &optional TERMINAL)<a name="debian-run-directories"></a>
<h3>Function: debian-run-directories</h3>
Load each file of the form XXfilename.el or XXfilename.elc in any
of the dirs, where XX must be a number.  The files will be run in
alphabetical order.  If a file appears in more than one of the dirs,
then the earlier dir takes precedence, and a .elc file always
supercedes a .el file of the same name.<a name="isearch-mode-help"></a>
<h3>Function: isearch-mode-help</h3>
Display documentation of Isearch mode.<a name="dnd-open-file"></a>
<h3>Function: dnd-open-file</h3>
Open a local or remote file.
The file is opened in the current window, or a new window if
`dnd-open-file-other-window' is set.  URI is the url for the file,
and must have the format file://hostname/file-name.  ACTION is ignored.
The last / in file://hostname/ is part of the file name.<a name="checkdoc-rogue-spaces"></a>
<h3>Function: checkdoc-rogue-spaces</h3>
Find extra spaces at the end of lines in the current file.
Prefix argument TAKE-NOTES non-nil means to save warnings in a
separate buffer.  Otherwise print a message.  This returns the error
if there is one.
Optional argument INTERACT permits more interactive fixing.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional TAKE-NOTES INTERACT)<a name="scroll-other-window"></a>
<h3>Function: scroll-other-window</h3>
Scroll next window upward ARG lines; or near full screen if no ARG.
A near full screen is `next-screen-context-lines' less than a full screen.
The next window is the one below the current one; or the one at the top
if the current one is at the bottom.  Negative ARG means scroll downward.
If ARG is the atom `-', scroll downward by nearly full screen.
When calling from a program, supply as argument a number, nil, or `-'.</p>
<p>
If `other-window-scroll-buffer' is non-nil, scroll the window
showing that buffer, popping the buffer up if necessary.
If in the minibuffer, `minibuffer-scroll-window' if non-nil
specifies the window to scroll.  This takes precedence over
`other-window-scroll-buffer'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="-all?"></a>
<h3>Function: -all?</h3>
Return t if (PRED x) is non-nil for all x in LIST, else nil.</p>

<h3>Function: checkdoc-ispell-message-interactive</h3>
Check the style and spelling of message text interactively.
Calls `checkdoc-message-interactive' with spell-checking turned on.
Prefix argument TAKE-NOTES is the same as for `checkdoc-message-interactive'</p>
<p>
(fn &optional TAKE-NOTES)<a name="display-color-cells"></a>
<h3>Function: display-color-cells</h3>
Return the number of color cells supported by DISPLAY.<a name="current-input-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: current-input-mode</h3>
Return information about the way Emacs currently reads keyboard input.
The value is a list of the form (INTERRUPT FLOW META QUIT), where
  INTERRUPT is non-nil if Emacs is using interrupt-driven input; if
    nil, Emacs is using CBREAK mode.
  FLOW is non-nil if Emacs uses ^S/^Q flow control for output to the
    terminal; this does not apply if Emacs uses interrupt-driven input.
  META is t if accepting 8-bit input with 8th bit as Meta flag.
    META nil means ignoring the top bit, on the assumption it is parity.
    META is neither t nor nil if accepting 8-bit input and using
    all 8 bits as the character code.
  QUIT is the character Emacs currently uses to quit.
The elements of this list correspond to the arguments of
`set-input-mode'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="nsubst-if-not"></a>
<h3>Function: nsubst-if-not</h3>
Substitute NEW for elements not matching PREDICATE in TREE (destructively).
Any element of TREE which matches is changed to NEW (via a call to `setcar').</p>
<p>
Keywords supported:  :key</p>
<p>
(fn NEW PREDICATE TREE [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="customize-save-variable"></a>
<h3>Function: customize-save-variable</h3>
Set the default for VARIABLE to VALUE, and save it for future sessions.
Return VALUE.</p>
<p>
If VARIABLE has a `custom-set' property, that is used for setting
VARIABLE, otherwise `set-default' is used.</p>
<p>
If VARIABLE has a `variable-interactive' property, that is used as if
it were the arg to `interactive' (which see) to interactively read the value.</p>
<p>
If VARIABLE has a `custom-type' property, it must be a widget and the
`:prompt-value' property of that widget will be used for reading the value.</p>
<p>
If given a prefix (or a COMMENT argument), also prompt for a comment.<a name="text-clone-create"></a>
<h3>Function: text-clone-create</h3>
Create a text clone of START...END at point.
Text clones are chunks of text that are automatically kept identical:
changes done to one of the clones will be immediately propagated to the other.</p>
<p>
The buffer's content at point is assumed to be already identical to
the one between START and END.
If SYNTAX is provided it's a regexp that describes the possible text of
the clones; the clone will be shrunk or killed if necessary to ensure that
its text matches the regexp.
If SPREADP is non-nil it indicates that text inserted before/after the
clone should be incorporated in the clone.<a name="no-applicable-method"></a>
<h3>Function: no-applicable-method</h3>
Called if there are no implementations for OBJECT in METHOD.<a name="custom-declare-variable"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-declare-variable</h3>
Like `defcustom', but SYMBOL and DEFAULT are evaluated as normal arguments.
DEFAULT should be an expression to evaluate to compute the default value,
not the default value itself.</p>
<p>
DEFAULT is stored as SYMBOL's standard value, in SYMBOL's property
`standard-value'.  At the same time, SYMBOL's property `force-value' is
set to nil, as the value is no longer rogue.<a name="url-wait-for-string"></a>
<h3>Function: url-wait-for-string</h3>
Wait until string matching REGEXP arrives in process PROC's buffer.<a name="url-user-for-url"></a>
<h3>Function: url-user-for-url</h3>

<h3>Function: object-class</h3>
Return the class struct defining OBJ.<a name="mm-string-to-multibyte"></a>
<h3>Function: mm-string-to-multibyte</h3>
Return a multibyte string with the same individual chars as STRING.
If STRING is multibyte, the result is STRING itself.
Otherwise it is a newly created string, with no text properties.</p>
<p>
If STRING is unibyte and contains an 8-bit byte, it is converted to
the corresponding multibyte character of charset `eight-bit'.</p>
<p>
This differs from `string-as-multibyte' by converting each byte of a correct
utf-8 sequence to an eight-bit character, not just bytes that don't form a
correct sequence.</p>
<p>
(fn STRING)<a name="interrupt-process"></a>
<h3>Function: interrupt-process</h3>
Interrupt process PROCESS.
PROCESS may be a process, a buffer, or the name of a process or buffer.
No arg or nil means current buffer's process.
Second arg CURRENT-GROUP non-nil means send signal to
the current process-group of the process's controlling terminal
rather than to the process's own process group.
If the process is a shell, this means interrupt current subjob
rather than the shell.</p>
<p>
If CURRENT-GROUP is `lambda', and if the shell owns the terminal,
don't send the signal.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional PROCESS CURRENT-GROUP)<a name="set-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: set-buffer</h3>
Make buffer BUFFER-OR-NAME current for editing operations.
BUFFER-OR-NAME may be a buffer or the name of an existing buffer.  See
also `with-current-buffer' when you want to make a buffer current
temporarily.  This function does not display the buffer, so its effect
ends when the current command terminates.  Use `switch-to-buffer' or
`pop-to-buffer' to switch buffers permanently.</p>
<p>
(fn BUFFER-OR-NAME)<a name="defalias"></a>
<h3>Function: defalias</h3>
Set SYMBOL's function definition to DEFINITION.
Associates the function with the current load file, if any.
The optional third argument DOCSTRING specifies the documentation string
for SYMBOL; if it is omitted or nil, SYMBOL uses the documentation string
determined by DEFINITION.
The return value is undefined.</p>
<p>
(fn SYMBOL DEFINITION &optional DOCSTRING)<a name="find-if"></a>
<h3>Function: find-if</h3>
Find the first item satisfying PREDICATE in SEQ.
Return the matching item, or nil if not found.</p>

<p>
(fn PREDICATE SEQ [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="switch-to-next-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: switch-to-next-buffer</h3>
In WINDOW switch to next buffer.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.
Return the buffer switched to, nil if no suitable buffer could be
found.<a name="widget-sexp-validate"></a>
<h3>Function: widget-sexp-validate</h3></p>
<p>

(fn WIDGET)<a name="read-key-sequence-vector"></a>

<h3>Function: flycheck-parse-output</h3>
Parse OUTPUT from CHECKER in BUFFER.</p>
<p>
OUTPUT is a string with the output from the checker symbol
CHECKER.  BUFFER is the buffer which was checked.</p>
<p>
Return the errors parsed with the error patterns of CHECKER.<a name="flycheck-buffer-saved-p"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-buffer-saved-p</h3>
Determine whether BUFFER is saved to a file.</p>
<p>
BUFFER is the buffer to check.  If omitted or nil, use the
current buffer as BUFFER.</p>
<p>
Return non-nil if the BUFFER is backed by a file, and not
modified, or nil otherwise.<a name="epl-requirement-version"></a>
<h3>Function: epl-requirement-version</h3></p>
<p>

(fn CL-X)<a name="url-warn"></a>
<h3>Function: url-warn</h3>
Display a warning message, MESSAGE.
TYPE is the warning type: either a custom group name (a symbol),
or a list of symbols whose first element is a custom group name.
(The rest of the symbols represent subcategories, for warning purposes
only, and you can use whatever symbols you like.)</p>
<p>
LEVEL should be either :debug, :warning, :error, or :emergency
(but see `warning-minimum-level' and `warning-minimum-log-level').
Default is :warning.</p>
<p>
:emergency -- a problem that will seriously impair Emacs operation soon
	      if you do not attend to it promptly.
:error     -- data or circumstances that are inherently wrong.
:warning   -- data or circumstances that are not inherently wrong,
	      but raise suspicion of a possible problem.
:debug     -- info for debugging only.</p>
<p>
BUFFER-NAME, if specified, is the name of the buffer for logging
the warning.  By default, it is `*Warnings*'.  If this function
has to create the buffer, it disables undo in the buffer.</p>
<p>
See the `warnings' custom group for user customization features.</p>
<p>
See also `warning-series', `warning-prefix-function' and
`warning-fill-prefix' for additional programming features.<a name="password-cache-remove"></a>
<h3>Function: password-cache-remove</h3>
Remove password indexed by KEY from password cache.
This is typically run by a timer setup from `password-cache-add',
but can be invoked at any time to forcefully remove passwords
from the cache.  This may be useful when it has been detected
that a password is invalid, so that `password-read' query the
user again.<a name="pop-to-mark-command"></a>
<h3>Function: pop-to-mark-command</h3>
Jump to mark, and pop a new position for mark off the ring.
(Does not affect global mark ring).<a name="next-single-property-change"></a>
<h3>Function: next-single-property-change</h3>
Return the position of next property change for a specific property.
Scans characters forward from POSITION till it finds
a change in the PROP property, then returns the position of the change.
If the optional third argument OBJECT is a buffer (or nil, which means
the current buffer), POSITION is a buffer position (integer or marker).
If OBJECT is a string, POSITION is a 0-based index into it.
The property values are compared with `eq'.
Return nil if the property is constant all the way to the end of OBJECT.
If the value is non-nil, it is a position greater than POSITION, never equal.</p>
<p>
If the optional fourth argument LIMIT is non-nil, don't search
past position LIMIT; return LIMIT if nothing is found before LIMIT.</p>
<p>

if appropriate.  It also arranges to cancel that timer when the next
command starts, by installing a pre-command hook.<a name="follow-delete-other-windows-and-split"></a>
<h3>Function: follow-delete-other-windows-and-split</h3>
Create two side by side windows and enter Follow mode.</p>
<p>
Execute this command to display as much as possible of the text
in the selected window.  All other windows, in the current
frame, are deleted and the selected window is split in two
side-by-side windows.  Follow mode is activated, hence the
two windows always will display two successive pages.
(If one window is moved, the other one will follow.)</p>
<p>
If ARG is positive, the leftmost window is selected.  If negative,
the rightmost is selected.  If ARG is nil, the leftmost window is
selected if the original window is the first one in the frame.</p>

<h3>Function: mark</h3>
Return this buffer's mark value as integer, or nil if never set.</p>
<p>
In Transient Mark mode, this function signals an error if
the mark is not active.  However, if `mark-even-if-inactive' is non-nil,
or the argument FORCE is non-nil, it disregards whether the mark
is active, and returns an integer or nil in the usual way.</p>

Normally, return a network process object; with a non-nil
:return-list parameter, return a list instead (see below).
Input and output work as for subprocesses; `delete-process'
closes it.</p>
<p>
NAME is the name for the process.  It is modified if necessary to
 make it unique.
BUFFER is a buffer or buffer name to associate with the process.
 Process output goes at end of that buffer.  BUFFER may be nil,
 meaning that the process is not associated with any buffer.
HOST is the name or IP address of the host to connect to.
SERVICE is the name of the service desired, or an integer specifying
 a port number to connect to.</p>
<p>
The remaining PARAMETERS should be a sequence of keywords and
values:</p>
<p>
:type specifies the connection type, one of the following:
  nil or `network'
             -- Begin with an ordinary network connection, and if
                the parameters :success and :capability-command
                are also supplied, try to upgrade to an encrypted
                connection via STARTTLS.  Even if that
                fails (e.g. if HOST does not support TLS), retain
                an unencrypted connection.
  `plain'    -- An ordinary, unencrypted network connection.
  `starttls' -- Begin with an ordinary connection, and try
                upgrading via STARTTLS.  If that fails for any
                reason, drop the connection; in that case the
                returned object is a killed process.
  `tls'      -- A TLS connection.
  `ssl'      -- Equivalent to `tls'.
  `shell'    -- A shell connection.</p>
<p>
:return-list specifies this function's return value.
  If omitted or nil, return a process object.  A non-nil means to
  return (PROC . PROPS), where PROC is a process object and PROPS
  is a plist of connection properties, with these keywords:
   :greeting -- the greeting returned by HOST (a string), or nil.
   :capabilities -- a string representing HOST's capabilities,
                    or nil if none could be found.
   :type -- the resulting connection type; `plain' (unencrypted)
            or `tls' (TLS-encrypted).</p>
<p>
:end-of-command specifies a regexp matching the end of a command.</p>
<p>
:end-of-capability specifies a regexp matching the end of the
  response to the command specified for :capability-command.
  It defaults to the regexp specified for :end-of-command.</p>
<p>
:success specifies a regexp matching a message indicating a
  successful STARTTLS negotiation.  For instance, the default
  should be "^3" for an NNTP connection.</p>
<p>
:capability-command specifies a command used to query the HOST
  for its capabilities.  For instance, for IMAP this should be
  "1 CAPABILITY\r\n".</p>
<p>
:starttls-function specifies a function for handling STARTTLS.
  This function should take one parameter, the response to the
  capability command, and should return the command to switch on
  STARTTLS if the server supports STARTTLS, and nil otherwise.</p>
<p>
:always-query-capabilities says whether to query the server for
  capabilities, even if we're doing a `plain' network connection.</p>
<p>
:client-certificate should either be a list where the first
  element is the certificate key file name, and the second
  element is the certificate file name itself, or `t', which
  means that `auth-source' will be queried for the key and the
  certificate.  This parameter will only be used when doing TLS
  or STARTTLS connections.</p>
<p>
:use-starttls-if-possible is a boolean that says to do opportunistic
STARTTLS upgrades even if Emacs doesn't have built-in TLS functionality.</p>
<p>
:nowait is a boolean that says the connection should be made
  asynchronously, if possible.<a name="custom-variable-action"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-variable-action</h3>
Show the menu for `custom-variable' WIDGET.
Optional EVENT is the location for the menu.<a name="dabbrev--search"></a>
<h3>Function: dabbrev--search</h3>
Search for something that could be used to expand ABBREV.</p>
<p>
Second arg, REVERSE, is t for reverse search, nil for forward.
The variable `dabbrev-limit' controls the maximum search region size.
Third argument IGNORE-CASE non-nil means treat case as insignificant while
looking for a match and when comparing with previous matches.  Also if
that's non-nil and the match is found at the beginning of a sentence
and is in lower case except for the initial then it is converted to
all lower case for return.</p>
<p>
Table of expansions already seen is examined in buffer
`dabbrev--last-table' so that only distinct possibilities are found
by dabbrev-re-expand.</p>
<p>
Returns the expansion found, or nil if not found.
Leaves point at the location of the start of the expansion.</p>
<p>
(fn ABBREV REVERSE IGNORE-CASE)<a name="package-menu-mark-obsolete-for-deletion"></a>
<h3>Function: package-menu-mark-obsolete-for-deletion</h3>
Mark all obsolete packages for deletion.<a name="next-match"></a>
<h3>Function: next-match</h3>
Visit next `next-error' message and corresponding source code.</p>
<p>
If all the error messages parsed so far have been processed already,
the message buffer is checked for new ones.</p>
<p>
A prefix ARG specifies how many error messages to move;
negative means move back to previous error messages.
Just C-u as a prefix means reparse the error message buffer
and start at the first error.</p>
<p>
The RESET argument specifies that we should restart from the beginning.</p>
<p>
C-x ` normally uses the most recently started
compilation, grep, or occur buffer.  It can also operate on any
buffer with output from the M-x compile, M-x grep commands, or,
more generally, on any buffer in Compilation mode or with
Compilation Minor mode enabled, or any buffer in which
`next-error-function' is bound to an appropriate function.
To specify use of a particular buffer for error messages, type
C-x ` in that buffer when it is the only one displayed
in the current frame.</p>
<p>
Once C-x ` has chosen the buffer for error messages, it
runs `next-error-hook' with `run-hooks', and stays with that buffer
until you use it in some other buffer which uses Compilation mode
or Compilation Minor mode.</p>
<p>
To control which errors are matched, customize the variable
`compilation-error-regexp-alist'.<a name="shell-command-on-region"></a>
<h3>Function: shell-command-on-region</h3>
Execute string COMMAND in inferior shell with region as input.
Normally display output (if any) in temp buffer `*Shell Command Output*';
Prefix arg means replace the region with it.  Return the exit code of
COMMAND.</p>
<p>
To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the input and output to the shell command, use C-x RET c
before this command.  By default, the input (from the current buffer)
is encoded using coding-system specified by `process-coding-system-alist',
falling back to `default-process-coding-system' if no match for COMMAND
is found in `process-coding-system-alist'.</p>
<p>
Noninteractive callers can specify coding systems by binding
`coding-system-for-read' and `coding-system-for-write'.</p>
<p>
If the command generates output, the output may be displayed
in the echo area or in a buffer.
If the output is short enough to display in the echo area
(determined by the variable `max-mini-window-height' if
`resize-mini-windows' is non-nil), it is shown there.
Otherwise it is displayed in the buffer `*Shell Command Output*'.
The output is available in that buffer in both cases.</p>
<p>
If there is output and an error, a message about the error
appears at the end of the output.  If there is no output, or if
output is inserted in the current buffer, the buffer `*Shell
Command Output*' is deleted.</p>
<p>
Optional fourth arg OUTPUT-BUFFER specifies where to put the
command's output.  If the value is a buffer or buffer name, put
the output there.  Any other value, including nil, means to
insert the output in the current buffer.  In either case, the
output is inserted after point (leaving mark after it).</p>
<p>
Optional fifth arg REPLACE, if non-nil, means to insert the
output in place of text from START to END, putting point and mark
around it.</p>
<p>
Optional sixth arg ERROR-BUFFER, if non-nil, specifies a buffer
or buffer name to which to direct the command's standard error
output.  If nil, error output is mingled with regular output.
When called interactively, `shell-command-default-error-buffer'
is used for ERROR-BUFFER.</p>
<p>
Optional seventh arg DISPLAY-ERROR-BUFFER, if non-nil, means to
display the error buffer if there were any errors.  When called
interactively, this is t.<a name="visible-frame-list"></a>
<h3>Function: visible-frame-list</h3>
Return a list of all frames now "visible" (being updated).</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="input-pending-p"></a>
<h3>Function: input-pending-p</h3>

Actually, the value is nil only if we can be sure that no input is available;
if there is a doubt, the value is t.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="widget-convert-text"></a>
<h3>Function: widget-convert-text</h3>
Return a widget of type TYPE with endpoint FROM TO.
No text will be inserted to the buffer, instead the text between FROM
and TO will be used as the widgets end points.  If optional arguments
BUTTON-FROM and BUTTON-TO are given, these will be used as the widgets
button end points.
Optional ARGS are extra keyword arguments for TYPE.</p>
<p>
(fn TYPE FROM TO &optional BUTTON-FROM BUTTON-TO &rest ARGS)<a name="mm-encode-coding-string"></a>
<h3>Function: mm-encode-coding-string</h3>
Encode STRING to CODING-SYSTEM, and return the result.</p>
<p>
Optional third arg NOCOPY non-nil means it is OK to return STRING
itself if the encoding operation is trivial.</p>
<p>
Optional fourth arg BUFFER non-nil means that the encoded text is
inserted in that buffer after point (point does not move).  In this
case, the return value is the length of the encoded text.</p>
<p>
This function sets `last-coding-system-used' to the precise coding system
used (which may be different from CODING-SYSTEM if CODING-SYSTEM is
not fully specified.)</p>

(fn DIR NAME BRANCHP)<a name="kmacro-start-macro-or-insert-counter"></a>
<h3>Function: kmacro-start-macro-or-insert-counter</h3>
Record subsequent keyboard input, defining a keyboard macro.
The commands are recorded even as they are executed.</p>
<p>
Sets the `kmacro-counter' to ARG (or 0 if no prefix arg) before defining the
macro.</p>
<p>
With C-u, appends to current keyboard macro (keeping
the current value of `kmacro-counter').</p>
<p>
When defining/executing macro, inserts macro counter and increments
the counter with ARG or 1 if missing.  With C-u,
inserts previous `kmacro-counter' (but do not modify counter).</p>
<p>
The macro counter can be modified via C-x C-k C-c and C-x C-k C-a.
The format of the counter can be modified via C-x C-k C-f.<a name="line-number-at-pos"></a>
<h3>Function: line-number-at-pos</h3>
Return (narrowed) buffer line number at position POS.
If POS is nil, use current buffer location.
Counting starts at (point-min), so the value refers
to the contents of the accessible portion of the buffer.<a name="read-kbd-macro"></a>
<h3>Function: read-kbd-macro</h3>
Read the region as a keyboard macro definition.
The region is interpreted as spelled-out keystrokes, e.g., "M-x abc RET".
See documentation for `edmacro-mode' for details.
Leading/trailing "C-x (" and "C-x )" in the text are allowed and ignored.
The resulting macro is installed as the "current" keyboard macro.</p>
<p>
In Lisp, may also be called with a single STRING argument in which case
the result is returned rather than being installed as the current macro.
The result will be a string if possible, otherwise an event vector.
Second argument NEED-VECTOR means to return an event vector always.<a name="buffer-chars-modified-tick"></a>
<h3>Function: buffer-chars-modified-tick</h3>
Return BUFFER's character-change tick counter.
Each buffer has a character-change tick counter, which is set to the
value of the buffer's tick counter (see `buffer-modified-tick'), each
time text in that buffer is inserted or deleted.  By comparing the
values returned by two individual calls of `buffer-chars-modified-tick',
you can tell whether a character change occurred in that buffer in
between these calls.  No argument or nil as argument means use current
buffer as BUFFER.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional BUFFER)<a name="lm-commentary-mark"></a>
<h3>Function: lm-commentary-mark</h3>
Return the buffer location of the `Commentary' start marker.<a name="Info-history-find-file"></a>

<p>

(fn PATTERN)<a name="date-leap-year-p"></a>
<h3>Function: date-leap-year-p</h3>
Return t if YEAR is a leap year.<a name="rmail-output-body-to-file"></a>
<h3>Function: rmail-output-body-to-file</h3>
Write this message body to the file FILE-NAME.
Interactively, the default file name comes from either the message
"Subject" header, or from `rmail-default-body-file'.  Updates the value
of `rmail-default-body-file' accordingly.  In all uses, if FILE-NAME
is not absolute, it is expanded with the directory part of
`rmail-default-body-file'.</p>
<p>
Note that this overwrites FILE-NAME (after confirmation), rather
than appending to it.  Deletes the message after writing if
`rmail-delete-after-output' is non-nil.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE-NAME)<a name="Info-on-current-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-on-current-buffer</h3>
Use Info mode to browse the current Info buffer.
With a prefix arg, this queries for the node name to visit first;
otherwise, that defaults to `Top'.<a name="icomplete-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: icomplete-mode</h3>
Toggle incremental minibuffer completion (Icomplete mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Icomplete mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="kill-rectangle"></a>
<h3>Function: kill-rectangle</h3>
Delete the region-rectangle and save it as the last killed one.</p>
<p>
When called from a program the rectangle's corners are START and END.
You might prefer to use `delete-extract-rectangle' from a program.</p>
<p>
With a prefix (or a FILL) argument, also fill lines where nothing has to be
deleted.</p>
<p>
If the buffer is read-only, Emacs will beep and refrain from deleting
the rectangle, but put it in the kill ring anyway.  This means that
you can use this command to copy text from a read-only buffer.
(If the variable `kill-read-only-ok' is non-nil, then this won't
even beep.)</p>
<p>
(fn START END &optional FILL)<a name="custom-theme-name-valid-p"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-theme-name-valid-p</h3>
Return t if NAME is a valid name for a Custom theme, nil otherwise.
NAME should be a symbol.<a name="profiler-cpu-log"></a>
<h3>Function: profiler-cpu-log</h3>
Return the current cpu profiler log.
The log is a hash-table mapping backtraces to counters which represent
the amount of time spent at those points.  Every backtrace is a vector
of functions, where the last few elements may be nil.
Before returning, a new log is allocated for future samples.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="keymap-prompt"></a>
<h3>Function: keymap-prompt</h3>
Return the prompt-string of a keymap MAP.

strings are stripped.<a name="byte-optimize-nonassociative-math"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-optimize-nonassociative-math</h3></p>
<p>

(fn FORM)<a name="outline-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: outline-mode</h3>
Set major mode for editing outlines with selective display.
Headings are lines which start with asterisks: one for major headings,
two for subheadings, etc.  Lines not starting with asterisks are body lines.</p>
<p>
Body text or subheadings under a heading can be made temporarily
invisible, or visible again.  Invisible lines are attached to the end
of the heading, so they move with it, if the line is killed and yanked
back.  A heading with text hidden under it is marked with an ellipsis (...).</p>
<p>
Commands:
Uses keymap `outline-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
M-x outline-next-visible-heading   outline-next-visible-heading      move by visible headings
M-x outline-previous-visible-heading   outline-previous-visible-heading
M-x outline-forward-same-level   outline-forward-same-level        similar but skip subheadings
M-x outline-backward-same-level   outline-backward-same-level
M-x outline-up-heading   outline-up-heading		    move from subheading to heading</p>
<p>
M-x hide-body	make all text invisible (not headings).
M-x show-all	make everything in buffer visible.
M-x hide-sublevels  make only the first N levels of headers visible.</p>
<p>
The remaining commands are used when point is on a heading line.
They apply to some of the body or subheadings of that heading.
M-x hide-subtree   hide-subtree	make body and subheadings invisible.
M-x show-subtree   show-subtree	make body and subheadings visible.
M-x show-children   show-children	make direct subheadings visible.
		 No effect on body, or subheadings 2 or more levels down.
		 With arg N, affects subheadings N levels down.
M-x hide-entry	   make immediately following body invisible.
M-x show-entry	   make it visible.
M-x hide-leaves	   make body under heading and under its subheadings invisible.
		     The subheadings remain visible.
M-x show-branches  make all subheadings at all levels visible.</p>
<p>
The variable `outline-regexp' can be changed to control what is a heading.
A line is a heading if `outline-regexp' matches something at the
beginning of the line.  The longer the match, the deeper the level.</p>
<p>
Turning on outline mode calls the value of `text-mode-hook' and then of
`outline-mode-hook', if they are non-nil.</p>

If COUNT is negative, scan backwards.
Returns the character number of the position thus found.</p>
<p>
Comments are ignored if `parse-sexp-ignore-comments' is non-nil.</p>
<p>
If the beginning or end of (the accessible part of) the buffer is reached
in the middle of a parenthetical grouping, an error is signaled.
If the beginning or end is reached between groupings
but before count is used up, nil is returned.</p>

(fn)<a name="mouse-save-then-kill"></a>
<h3>Function: mouse-save-then-kill</h3>
Set the region according to CLICK; the second time, kill it.
CLICK should be a mouse click event.</p>
<p>
If the region is inactive, activate it temporarily.  Set mark at
the original point, and move point to the position of CLICK.</p>
<p>
If the region is already active, adjust it.  Normally, do this by
moving point or mark, whichever is closer, to CLICK.  But if you
have selected whole words or lines, move point or mark to the
word or line boundary closest to CLICK instead.</p>
<p>
If `mouse-drag-copy-region' is non-nil, this command also saves the
new region to the kill ring (replacing the previous kill if the
previous region was just saved to the kill ring).</p>
<p>
If this command is called a second consecutive time with the same
CLICK position, kill the region (or delete it
if `mouse-drag-copy-region' is non-nil)</p>
<p>
(fn CLICK)<a name="quickurl-browse-url"></a>
<h3>Function: quickurl-browse-url</h3>

<h3>Function: svref</h3>
Return the element of ARRAY at index IDX.
ARRAY may be a vector, a string, a char-table, a bool-vector,
or a byte-code object.  IDX starts at 0.</p>
<p>
(fn ARRAY IDX)<a name="setup-specified-language-environment"></a>
<h3>Function: setup-specified-language-environment</h3>
Switch to a specified language environment.<a name="number-sequence"></a>
<h3>Function: number-sequence</h3>
Return a sequence of numbers from FROM to TO (both inclusive) as a list.
INC is the increment used between numbers in the sequence and defaults to 1.
So, the Nth element of the list is (+ FROM (* N INC)) where N counts from
zero.  TO is only included if there is an N for which TO = FROM + N * INC.
If TO is nil or numerically equal to FROM, return (FROM).
If INC is positive and TO is less than FROM, or INC is negative
and TO is larger than FROM, return nil.
If INC is zero and TO is neither nil nor numerically equal to
FROM, signal an error.</p>
<p>
This function is primarily designed for integer arguments.
Nevertheless, FROM, TO and INC can be integer or float.  However,
floating point arithmetic is inexact.  For instance, depending on
the machine, it may quite well happen that
(number-sequence 0.4 0.6 0.2) returns the one element list (0.4),
whereas (number-sequence 0.4 0.8 0.2) returns a list with three
elements.  Thus, if some of the arguments are floats and one wants
to make sure that TO is included, one may have to explicitly write
TO as (+ FROM (* N INC)) or use a variable whose value was
computed with this exact expression.  Alternatively, you can,
of course, also replace TO with a slightly larger value
(or a slightly more negative value if INC is negative).<a name="apropos-safe-documentation"></a>

Explode a search path into a list of directory names.
Directories are separated by `path-separator' (which is colon in
GNU and Unix systems).  Substitute environment variables into the
resulting list of directory names.  For an empty path element (i.e.,

<h3>Function: font-lock-extend-jit-lock-region-after-change</h3>
Function meant for `jit-lock-after-change-extend-region-functions'.
This function does 2 things:
- extend the region so that it not only includes the part that was modified
  but also the surrounding text whose highlighting may change as a consequence.
- anticipate (part of) the region extension that will happen later in
  `font-lock-default-fontify-region', in order to avoid the need for
  double-redisplay in `jit-lock-fontify-now'.<a name="ediff-customize"></a>

<h3>Function: clrhash</h3>
Clear hash table TABLE and return it.</p>
<p>
(fn TABLE)<a name="query-replace-regexp-eval"></a>
<h3>Function: query-replace-regexp-eval</h3>
Replace some things after point matching REGEXP with the result of TO-EXPR.</p>
<p>
Interactive use of this function is deprecated in favor of the
`\,' feature of `query-replace-regexp'.  For non-interactive use, a loop
using `search-forward-regexp' and `replace-match' is preferred.</p>
<p>
As each match is found, the user must type a character saying
what to do with it.  For directions, type C-h at that time.</p>
<p>
TO-EXPR is a Lisp expression evaluated to compute each replacement.  It may
reference `replace-count' to get the number of replacements already made.
If the result of TO-EXPR is not a string, it is converted to one using
`prin1-to-string' with the NOESCAPE argument (which see).</p>
<p>
For convenience, when entering TO-EXPR interactively, you can use `\&' or
`\0' to stand for whatever matched the whole of REGEXP, and `\N' (where
N is a digit) to stand for whatever matched the Nth `\(...\)' in REGEXP.
Use `\#&' or `\#N' if you want a number instead of a string.
In interactive use, `\#' in itself stands for `replace-count'.</p>
<p>
In Transient Mark mode, if the mark is active, operate on the contents
of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the end of the buffer.</p>
<p>
Use M-n to pull the last incremental search regexp to the minibuffer
that reads REGEXP.</p>
<p>
Preserves case in each replacement if `case-replace' and `case-fold-search'
are non-nil and REGEXP has no uppercase letters.</p>
<p>
If `replace-regexp-lax-whitespace' is non-nil, a space or spaces in the regexp
to be replaced will match a sequence of whitespace chars defined by the
regexp in `search-whitespace-regexp'.</p>
<p>
Third arg DELIMITED (prefix arg if interactive), if non-nil, means replace
only matches that are surrounded by word boundaries.
Fourth and fifth arg START and END specify the region to operate on.<a name="elint-initialize"></a>
<h3>Function: elint-initialize</h3>

Major mode for viewing an archive file in a dired-like way.
You can move around using the usual cursor motion commands.
Letters no longer insert themselves.
Type `e' to pull a file out of the archive and into its own buffer;
or click mouse-2 on the file's line in the archive mode buffer.</p>
<p>
If you edit a sub-file of this archive (as with the `e' command) and
save it, the contents of that buffer will be saved back into the
archive.</p>

(fn &optional FORCE)<a name="shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer</h3>
Shrink height of WINDOW if its buffer doesn't need so many lines.
More precisely, shrink WINDOW vertically to be as small as
possible, while still showing the full contents of its buffer.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
Do not shrink WINDOW to less than `window-min-height' lines.  Do
nothing if the buffer contains more lines than the present window
height, or if some of the window's contents are scrolled out of
view, or if shrinking this window would also shrink another
window, or if the window is the only window of its frame.</p>
<p>
Return non-nil if the window was shrunk, nil otherwise.<a name="comment-set-column"></a>
<h3>Function: comment-set-column</h3>
Set the comment column based on point.

Noninteractively, the third argument JUSTIFY specifies which
kind of justification to do: `full', `left', `right', `center',
or `none' (equivalent to nil).  A value of t means handle each
paragraph as specified by its text properties.</p>
<p>
The fourth arg NOSQUEEZE non-nil means to leave whitespace other
than line breaks untouched, and fifth arg TO-EOP non-nil means
to keep filling to the end of the paragraph (or next hard newline,
if variable `use-hard-newlines' is on).</p>
<p>
Return the fill-prefix used for filling the last paragraph.</p>
<p>
If `sentence-end-double-space' is non-nil, then period followed by one
space does not end a sentence, so don't break a line there.<a name="join-line"></a>
<h3>Function: join-line</h3>
Join this line to previous and fix up whitespace at join.
If there is a fill prefix, delete it from the beginning of this line.
With argument, join this line to following line.<a name="ps-spool-buffer-with-faces"></a>
<h3>Function: ps-spool-buffer-with-faces</h3>
Generate and spool a PostScript image of the buffer.
Like `ps-spool-buffer', but includes font, color, and underline information in
the generated image.  This command works only if you are using a window system,
so it has a way to determine color values.</p>
<p>
Use the command `ps-despool' to send the spooled images to the printer.</p>

a negative argument ARG = -N means move backward N paragraphs.</p>
<p>
A line which `paragraph-start' matches either separates paragraphs
(if `paragraph-separate' matches it also) or is the first line of a paragraph.
A paragraph end is the beginning of a line which is not part of the paragraph
to which the end of the previous line belongs, or the end of the buffer.
Returns the count of paragraphs left to move.<a name="custom-reevaluate-setting"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-reevaluate-setting</h3>
Reset the value of SYMBOL by re-evaluating its saved or standard value.
Use the :set function to do so.  This is useful for customizable options
that are defined before their standard value can really be computed.
E.g. dumped variables whose default depends on run-time information.<a name="byte-compile-quo"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-compile-quo</h3></p>
<p>

(fn FORM)<a name="mapl"></a>

<h3>Function: update-file-autoloads</h3>
Update the autoloads for FILE.
If prefix arg SAVE-AFTER is non-nil, save the buffer too.</p>
<p>
If FILE binds `generated-autoload-file' as a file-local variable,
autoloads are written into that file.  Otherwise, the autoloads
file is determined by OUTFILE.  If called interactively, prompt
for OUTFILE; if called from Lisp with OUTFILE nil, use the
existing value of `generated-autoload-file'.</p>
<p>
Return FILE if there was no autoload cookie in it, else nil.</p>

The list is in the same order as the buffer, that is, the car is the
  first marked file.
Values returned are normally absolute file names.
Optional arg LOCALP as in `dired-get-filename'.
Optional second argument ARG, if non-nil, specifies files near
 point instead of marked files.  It usually comes from the prefix
 argument.
  If ARG is an integer, use the next ARG files.
  Any other non-nil value means to use the current file instead.
Optional third argument FILTER, if non-nil, is a function to select
  some of the files--those for which (funcall FILTER FILENAME) is non-nil.</p>
<p>
If DISTINGUISH-ONE-MARKED is non-nil, then if we find just one marked file,
return (t FILENAME) instead of (FILENAME).
Don't use that together with FILTER.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional LOCALP ARG FILTER DISTINGUISH-ONE-MARKED)<a name="Info-index-node"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-index-node</h3>
Return non-nil value if NODE is an index node.
If NODE is nil, check the current Info node.

<p>
(fn)<a name="tabulated-list-print-entry"></a>
<h3>Function: tabulated-list-print-entry</h3>
Insert a Tabulated List entry at point.
This is the default `tabulated-list-printer' function.  ID is a
Lisp object identifying the entry to print, and COLS is a vector
of column descriptors.</p>
<p>
(fn ID COLS)<a name="describe-key-briefly"></a>
<h3>Function: describe-key-briefly</h3>
Print the name of the function KEY invokes.  KEY is a string.
If INSERT (the prefix arg) is non-nil, insert the message in the buffer.
If non-nil, UNTRANSLATED is a vector of the untranslated events.
It can also be a number in which case the untranslated events from
the last key hit are used.</p>
<p>
If KEY is a menu item or a tool-bar button that is disabled, this command
temporarily enables it to allow getting help on disabled items and buttons.<a name="cua-selection-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: cua-selection-mode</h3>
Enable CUA selection mode without the C-z/C-x/C-c/C-v bindings.</p>
<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="foreground-color-at-point"></a>
<h3>Function: foreground-color-at-point</h3>
Return the foreground color of the character after point.<a name="completing-read-multiple"></a>
<h3>Function: completing-read-multiple</h3>
Read multiple strings in the minibuffer, with completion.
By using this functionality, a user may specify multiple strings at a
single prompt, optionally using completion.</p>
<p>
Multiple strings are specified by separating each of the strings with
a prespecified separator character.  For example, if the separator
character is a comma, the strings 'alice', 'bob', and 'eve' would be
specified as 'alice,bob,eve'.</p>
<p>
The default value for the separator character is the value of
`crm-default-separator' (comma).  The separator character may be
changed by modifying the value of `crm-separator'.</p>
<p>
Contiguous strings of non-separator-characters are referred to as
'elements'.  In the aforementioned example, the elements are: 'alice',
'bob', and 'eve'.</p>
<p>
Completion is available on a per-element basis.  For example, if the
contents of the minibuffer are 'alice,bob,eve' and point is between
'l' and 'i', pressing TAB operates on the element 'alice'.</p>
<p>
The return value of this function is a list of the read strings.</p>
<p>
See the documentation for `completing-read' for details on the arguments:
PROMPT, TABLE, PREDICATE, REQUIRE-MATCH, INITIAL-INPUT, HIST, DEF, and
INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD.</p>
<p>
(fn PROMPT TABLE &optional PREDICATE REQUIRE-MATCH INITIAL-INPUT HIST DEF INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD)<a name="custom-note-var-changed"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-note-var-changed</h3>
Inform Custom that VARIABLE has been set (changed).
VARIABLE is a symbol that names a user option.
The result is that the change is treated as having been made through Custom.<a name="set-input-meta-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: set-input-meta-mode</h3>
Enable or disable 8-bit input on TERMINAL.
If META is t, Emacs will accept 8-bit input, and interpret the 8th
bit as the Meta modifier.</p>
<p>
If META is nil, Emacs will ignore the top bit, on the assumption it is
parity.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, Emacs will accept and pass through 8-bit input without
specially interpreting the top bit.</p>
<p>
This setting only has an effect on tty terminal devices.</p>
<p>
Optional parameter TERMINAL specifies the tty terminal device to use.
It may be a terminal object, a frame, or nil for the terminal used by
the currently selected frame.</p>
<p>
See also `current-input-mode'.</p>
<p>
(fn META &optional TERMINAL)<a name="flycheck-report-status"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-report-status</h3>
Report Flycheck STATUS.</p>
<p>
STATUS is one of the following symbols:</p>
<p>
`not-checked'
     The current buffer was not checked.</p>
<p>
`no-checker'
     Automatic syntax checker selection did not find a suitable
     syntax checker.</p>
<p>
`running'
     A syntax check is now running in the current buffer.</p>
<p>
`errored'
     The current syntax check has errored.</p>
<p>
`finished'
     The current syntax check was finished normally.</p>
<p>
`interrupted'
     The current syntax check was interrupted.</p>
<p>
`suspicious'
     The last syntax check had a suspicious result.</p>
<p>
Set `flycheck-last-status-change' and call
`flycheck-status-changed-functions' with STATUS.  Afterwards
refresh the mode line.<a name="ewoc--last-node"></a>
<h3>Function: ewoc--last-node</h3></p>
<p>

(fn CL-X)<a name="eieio-add-new-slot"></a>
<h3>Function: eieio-add-new-slot</h3>
Add into NEWC attribute A.
If A already exists in NEWC, then do nothing.  If it doesn't exist,
then also add in D (default), DOC, TYPE, CUST, LABEL, CUSTG, PRINT, PROT, and INIT arg.
Argument ALLOC specifies if the slot is allocated per instance, or per class.
If optional DEFAULTOVERRIDE is non-nil, then if A exists in NEWC,
we must override its value for a default.
Optional argument SKIPNIL indicates if type checking should be skipped
if default value is nil.<a name="check-parens"></a>
<h3>Function: check-parens</h3>
Check for unbalanced parentheses in the current buffer.
More accurately, check the narrowed part of the buffer for unbalanced
expressions ("sexps") in general.  This is done according to the
current syntax table and will find unbalanced brackets or quotes as
appropriate.  (See Info node `(emacs)Parentheses'.)  If imbalance is
found, an error is signaled and point is left at the first unbalanced
character.<a name="solitaire"></a>
<h3>Function: solitaire</h3>
Play Solitaire.</p>
<p>
To play Solitaire, type M-x solitaire.</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `solitaire-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
Move around the board using the cursor keys.
Move stones using M-x solitaire-move followed by a direction key.
Undo moves using M-x solitaire-undo.
Check for possible moves using M-x solitaire-do-check.
(The variable `solitaire-auto-eval' controls whether to automatically
check after each move or undo.)</p>
<p>
What is Solitaire?</p>
<p>
I don't know who invented this game, but it seems to be rather old and
its origin seems to be northern Africa.  Here's how to play:
Initially, the board will look similar to this:</p>
<p>
	Le Solitaire
	============</p>
<p>
		o   o   o</p>
<p>
		o   o   o</p>
<p>
	o   o   o   o   o   o   o</p>
<p>
	o   o   o   .   o   o   o</p>
<p>
	o   o   o   o   o   o   o</p>
<p>
		o   o   o</p>
<p>
		o   o   o</p>
<p>
Let's call the o's stones and the .'s holes.  One stone fits into one
hole.  As you can see, all holes but one are occupied by stones.  The
aim of the game is to get rid of all but one stone, leaving that last
one in the middle of the board if you're cool.</p>
<p>
A stone can be moved if there is another stone next to it, and a hole
after that one.  Thus there must be three fields in a row, either
horizontally or vertically, up, down, left or right, which look like
this:  o  o  .</p>
<p>
Then the first stone is moved to the hole, jumping over the second,
which therefore is taken away.  The above thus `evaluates' to:  .  .  o</p>
<p>
That's all.  Here's the board after two moves:</p>
<p>
		o   o   o</p>
<p>
		.   o   o</p>
<p>
	o   o   .   o   o   o   o</p>
<p>
	o   .   o   o   o   o   o</p>
<p>
	o   o   o   o   o   o   o</p>
<p>
		o   o   o</p>
<p>
		o   o   o</p>

<h3>Function: Info-scroll-up</h3>
Scroll one screenful forward in Info, considering all nodes as one sequence.
Once you scroll far enough in a node that its menu appears on the screen
but after point, the next scroll moves into its first subnode, unless
`Info-scroll-prefer-subnodes' is nil.</p>
<p>
When you scroll past the end of a node, that goes to the next node if
`Info-scroll-prefer-subnodes' is non-nil and to the first subnode otherwise;
if this node has no successor, it moves to the parent node's successor,
and so on.  If `Info-scroll-prefer-subnodes' is non-nil and point is inside
the menu of a node, it moves to subnode indicated by the following menu
item.  (That case won't normally result from this command, but can happen
in other ways.)<a name="comint-delete-input"></a>

<p>

(fn FROM TO)<a name="define-charset"></a>
<h3>Function: define-charset</h3>
Define NAME (symbol) as a charset with DOCSTRING.
The remaining arguments must come in pairs ATTRIBUTE VALUE.  ATTRIBUTE
may be any symbol.  The following have special meanings, and one of
`:code-offset', `:map', `:subset', `:superset' must be specified.</p>
<p>
`:short-name'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a short string to identify the charset.  If omitted,
NAME is used.</p>
<p>
`:long-name'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a string longer than `:short-name' to identify the
charset.  If omitted, the value of the `:short-name' attribute is used.</p>
<p>
`:dimension'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be an integer 0, 1, 2, or 3, specifying the dimension of
code-points of the charsets.  If omitted, it is calculated from the
value of the `:code-space' attribute.</p>
<p>
`:code-space'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a vector of length at most 8 specifying the byte code
range of each dimension in this format:
	[ MIN-1 MAX-1 MIN-2 MAX-2 ... ]
where MIN-N is the minimum byte value of Nth dimension of code-point,
MAX-N is the maximum byte value of that.</p>
<p>
`:min-code'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be an integer specifying the minimum code point of the
charset.  If omitted, it is calculated from `:code-space'.  VALUE may
be a cons (HIGH . LOW), where HIGH is the most significant 16 bits of
the code point and LOW is the least significant 16 bits.</p>
<p>
`:max-code'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be an integer specifying the maximum code point of the
charset.  If omitted, it is calculated from `:code-space'.  VALUE may
be a cons (HIGH . LOW), where HIGH is the most significant 16 bits of
the code point and LOW is the least significant 16 bits.</p>
<p>
`:iso-final-char'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a character in the range 32 to 127 (inclusive)
specifying the final char of the charset for ISO-2022 encoding.  If
omitted, the charset can't be encoded by ISO-2022 based
coding-systems.</p>
<p>
`:iso-revision-number'</p>
<p>

can't be encoded by coding-systems of type `emacs-mule'.</p>
<p>
`:ascii-compatible-p'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be nil or t (default nil).  If VALUE is t, the charset is
compatible with ASCII, i.e. the first 128 code points map to ASCII.</p>
<p>
`:supplementary-p'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be nil or t.  If the VALUE is t, the charset is
supplementary, which means it is used only as a parent or a
subset of some other charset, or it is provided just for backward
compatibility.</p>
<p>
`:invalid-code'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a nonnegative integer that can be used as an invalid
code point of the charset.  If the minimum code is 0 and the maximum
code is greater than Emacs's maximum integer value, `:invalid-code'
should not be omitted.</p>
<p>
`:code-offset'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be an integer added to the index number of a character to
get the corresponding character code.</p>
<p>
`:map'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be vector or string.</p>
<p>
If it is a vector, the format is [ CODE-1 CHAR-1 CODE-2 CHAR-2 ... ],
where CODE-n is a code-point of the charset, and CHAR-n is the
corresponding character code.</p>
<p>
If it is a string, it is a name of file that contains the above
information.   Each line of the file must be this format:
	0xXXX 0xYYY
where XXX is a hexadecimal representation of CODE-n and YYY is a
hexadecimal representation of CHAR-n.  A line starting with `#' is a
comment line.</p>
<p>
`:subset'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a list:
	( PARENT MIN-CODE MAX-CODE OFFSET )
PARENT is a parent charset.  MIN-CODE and MAX-CODE specify the range
of characters inherited from the parent.  OFFSET is an integer value
to add to a code point of the parent charset to get the corresponding
code point of this charset.</p>
<p>
`:superset'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a list of parent charsets.  The charset inherits
characters from them.  Each element of the list may be a cons (PARENT
. OFFSET), where PARENT is a parent charset, and OFFSET is an offset
value to add to a code point of PARENT to get the corresponding code
point of this charset.</p>
<p>
`:unify-map'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be vector or string.</p>
<p>
If it is a vector, the format is [ CODE-1 CHAR-1 CODE-2 CHAR-2 ... ],
where CODE-n is a code-point of the charset, and CHAR-n is the
corresponding Unicode character code.</p>
<p>
If it is a string, it is a name of file that contains the above
information.  The file format is the same as what described for `:map'
attribute.<a name="process-coding-system"></a>
<h3>Function: process-coding-system</h3>
Return a cons of coding systems for decoding and encoding of PROCESS.</p>
<p>
(fn PROCESS)<a name="current-column"></a>
<h3>Function: current-column</h3>
Return the horizontal position of point.  Beginning of line is column 0.
This is calculated by adding together the widths of all the displayed
representations of the character between the start of the previous line
and point (e.g., control characters will have a width of 2 or 4, tabs
will have a variable width).
Ignores finite width of frame, which means that this function may return
values greater than (frame-width).
Whether the line is visible (if `selective-display' is t) has no effect;
however, ^M is treated as end of line when `selective-display' is t.
Text that has an invisible property is considered as having width 0, unless
`buffer-invisibility-spec' specifies that it is replaced by an ellipsis.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="make-variable-buffer-local"></a>
<h3>Function: make-variable-buffer-local</h3>
Make VARIABLE become buffer-local whenever it is set.
At any time, the value for the current buffer is in effect,
unless the variable has never been set in this buffer,
in which case the default value is in effect.
Note that binding the variable with `let', or setting it while
a `let'-style binding made in this buffer is in effect,
does not make the variable buffer-local.  Return VARIABLE.</p>
<p>
In most cases it is better to use `make-local-variable',
which makes a variable local in just one buffer.</p>
<p>
The function `default-value' gets the default value and `set-default' sets it.</p>
<p>
(fn VARIABLE)<a name="dired-move-to-filename"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-move-to-filename</h3>
Move to the beginning of the filename on the current line.

<h3>Function: mouse-save-then-kill-delete-region</h3></p>
<p>

(fn BEG END)<a name="blink-cursor-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: blink-cursor-mode</h3>
Toggle cursor blinking (Blink Cursor mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Blink Cursor mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
This command is effective only on graphical frames.  On text-only
terminals, cursor blinking is controlled by the terminal.<a name="info-lookup-file"></a>
<h3>Function: info-lookup-file</h3>
Display the documentation of a file.
When this command is called interactively, it reads FILE from the minibuffer.
In the minibuffer, use M-n to yank the default file name
into the minibuffer so you can edit it.
The default file name is the one found at point.</p>
<p>
With prefix arg a query for the file help mode is offered.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE &optional MODE)<a name="window-parameters"></a>
<h3>Function: window-parameters</h3>
Return the parameters of WINDOW and their values.
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.  The
return value is a list of elements of the form (PARAMETER . VALUE).</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WINDOW)<a name="insert-before-markers-and-inherit"></a>
<h3>Function: insert-before-markers-and-inherit</h3>
Insert text at point, relocating markers and inheriting properties.
Point and markers move forward to end up after the inserted text.</p>
<p>
If the current buffer is multibyte, unibyte strings are converted
to multibyte for insertion (see `unibyte-char-to-multibyte').
If the current buffer is unibyte, multibyte strings are converted
to unibyte for insertion.</p>
<p>
(fn &rest ARGS)<a name="tar-data-swapped-p"></a>
<h3>Function: tar-data-swapped-p</h3>
Return non-nil if the tar-data is in `tar-data-buffer'.<a name="hl-line-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: hl-line-mode</h3>
Toggle highlighting of the current line (Hl-Line mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Hl-Line mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Hl-Line mode is a buffer-local minor mode.  If
`hl-line-sticky-flag' is non-nil, Hl-Line mode highlights the
line about the buffer's point in all windows.  Caveat: the
buffer's point might be different from the point of a
non-selected window.  Hl-Line mode uses the function
`hl-line-highlight' on `post-command-hook' in this case.</p>
<p>
When `hl-line-sticky-flag' is nil, Hl-Line mode highlights the
line about point in the selected window only.  In this case, it
uses the function `hl-line-unhighlight' on `pre-command-hook' in
addition to `hl-line-highlight' on `post-command-hook'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="calculator"></a>
<h3>Function: calculator</h3>

See the documentation for `calculator-mode' for more information.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="fancy-splash-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: fancy-splash-frame</h3>
Return the frame to use for the fancy splash screen.
Returning non-nil does not mean we should necessarily
use the fancy splash screen, but if we do use it,
we put it on this frame.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="move-to-window-line-top-bottom"></a>
<h3>Function: move-to-window-line-top-bottom</h3>
Position point relative to window.</p>
<p>
With a prefix argument ARG, acts like `move-to-window-line'.</p>
<p>
With no argument, positions point at center of window.
Successive calls position point at positions defined
by `recenter-positions'.<a name="quit-process"></a>
<h3>Function: quit-process</h3>
Send QUIT signal to process PROCESS.  May be process or name of one.
See function `interrupt-process' for more details on usage.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional PROCESS CURRENT-GROUP)<a name="compile"></a>
<h3>Function: compile</h3>
Compile the program including the current buffer.  Default: run `make'.
Runs COMMAND, a shell command, in a separate process asynchronously
with output going to the buffer `*compilation*'.</p>
<p>
You can then use the command C-x ` to find the next error message
and move to the source code that caused it.</p>
<p>
If optional second arg COMINT is t the buffer will be in Comint mode with
`compilation-shell-minor-mode'.</p>
<p>
Interactively, prompts for the command if `compilation-read-command' is
non-nil; otherwise uses `compile-command'.  With prefix arg, always prompts.
Additionally, with universal prefix arg, compilation buffer will be in
comint mode, i.e. interactive.</p>
<p>
To run more than one compilation at once, start one then rename
the `*compilation*' buffer to some other name with
M-x rename-buffer.  Then _switch buffers_ and start the new compilation.
It will create a new `*compilation*' buffer.</p>
<p>
On most systems, termination of the main compilation process
kills its subprocesses.</p>
<p>
The name used for the buffer is actually whatever is returned by
the function in `compilation-buffer-name-function', so you can set that
to a function that generates a unique name.<a name="checkdoc-list-of-strings-p"></a>
<h3>Function: checkdoc-list-of-strings-p</h3></p>
<p>

(fn OBJ)<a name="process-attributes"></a>
<h3>Function: process-attributes</h3>
Return attributes of the process given by its PID, a number.</p>
<p>
Value is an alist where each element is a cons cell of the form</p>
<p>
    (KEY . VALUE)</p>
<p>
If this functionality is unsupported, the value is nil.</p>
<p>
See `list-system-processes' for getting a list of all process IDs.</p>
<p>
The KEYs of the attributes that this function may return are listed
below, together with the type of the associated VALUE (in parentheses).
Not all platforms support all of these attributes; unsupported
attributes will not appear in the returned alist.
Unless explicitly indicated otherwise, numbers can have either
integer or floating point values.</p>
<p>

<p>
(fn PID)<a name="lax-plist-get"></a>
<h3>Function: lax-plist-get</h3>
Extract a value from a property list, comparing with `equal'.
PLIST is a property list, which is a list of the form
(PROP1 VALUE1 PROP2 VALUE2...).  This function returns the value
corresponding to the given PROP, or nil if PROP is not
one of the properties on the list.</p>
<p>
(fn PLIST PROP)<a name="ert--button-action-position"></a>
<h3>Function: ert--button-action-position</h3>
The buffer position where the last button action was triggered.<a name="query-replace-regexp"></a>
<h3>Function: query-replace-regexp</h3>
Replace some things after point matching REGEXP with TO-STRING.
As each match is found, the user must type a character saying
what to do with it.  For directions, type C-h at that time.</p>
<p>
In Transient Mark mode, if the mark is active, operate on the contents
of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the end of the buffer.</p>
<p>
Use M-n to pull the last incremental search regexp to the minibuffer
that reads REGEXP, or invoke replacements from
incremental search with a key sequence like `C-M-s C-M-s C-M-%'
to use its current search regexp as the regexp to replace.</p>
<p>
Matching is independent of case if `case-fold-search' is non-nil and
REGEXP has no uppercase letters.  Replacement transfers the case
pattern of the old text to the new text, if `case-replace' and
`case-fold-search' are non-nil and REGEXP has no uppercase letters.
(Transferring the case pattern means that if the old text matched is
all caps, or capitalized, then its replacement is upcased or
capitalized.)</p>
<p>
If `replace-regexp-lax-whitespace' is non-nil, a space or spaces in the regexp
to be replaced will match a sequence of whitespace chars defined by the
regexp in `search-whitespace-regexp'.</p>
<p>
Third arg DELIMITED (prefix arg if interactive), if non-nil, means replace
only matches surrounded by word boundaries.
Fourth and fifth arg START and END specify the region to operate on.</p>
<p>
In TO-STRING, `\&' stands for whatever matched the whole of REGEXP,
and `\N' (where N is a digit) stands for
whatever what matched the Nth `\(...\)' in REGEXP.
`\?' lets you edit the replacement text in the minibuffer
at the given position for each replacement.</p>
<p>
In interactive calls, the replacement text can contain `\,'
followed by a Lisp expression.  Each
replacement evaluates that expression to compute the replacement
string.  Inside of that expression, `\&' is a string denoting the
whole match as a string, `\N' for a partial match, `\#&' and `\#N'
for the whole or a partial match converted to a number with
`string-to-number', and `\#' itself for the number of replacements
done so far (starting with zero).</p>
<p>
If the replacement expression is a symbol, write a space after it
to terminate it.  One space there, if any, will be discarded.</p>
<p>
When using those Lisp features interactively in the replacement
text, TO-STRING is actually made a list instead of a string.
Use C-x M-: after this command for details.<a name="ucs-normalize-NFC-string"></a>

<p>
Buffers not visible in windows are preferred to visible buffers,
unless VISIBLE-OK is non-nil.
If the optional argument FRAME is nil, it defaults to the selected frame.
If BUFFER is non-nil, ignore occurrences of that buffer in LIST.<a name="comment-dwim"></a>
<h3>Function: comment-dwim</h3>
Call the comment command you want (Do What I Mean).
If the region is active and `transient-mark-mode' is on, call
`comment-region' (unless it only consists of comments, in which
case it calls `uncomment-region').
Else, if the current line is empty, call `comment-insert-comment-function'
if it is defined, otherwise insert a comment and indent it.
Else if a prefix ARG is specified, call `comment-kill'.
Else, call `comment-indent'.
You can configure `comment-style' to change the way regions are commented.</p>
<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="custom-initialize-default"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-initialize-default</h3>
Initialize SYMBOL with VALUE.
This will do nothing if symbol already has a default binding.

<h3>Function: dired-do-symlink</h3>
Make symbolic links to current file or all marked (or next ARG) files.
When operating on just the current file, you specify the new name.
When operating on multiple or marked files, you specify a directory
and new symbolic links are made in that directory
with the same names that the files currently have.  The default
suggested for the target directory depends on the value of
`dired-dwim-target', which see.</p>

<h3>Function: rfc2047-encode-parameter</h3>
Return and PARAM=VALUE string encoded in the RFC2047-like style.
This is a substitution for the `rfc2231-encode-string' function, that
is the standard but many mailers don't support it.<a name="ring-index"></a>
<h3>Function: ring-index</h3>
Convert nominal ring index INDEX to an internal index.
The internal index refers to the items ordered from newest to oldest.
HEAD is the index of the oldest element in the ring.
RINGLEN is the number of elements currently in the ring.
VECLEN is the size of the vector in the ring.<a name="cl-make-random-state"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-make-random-state</h3>

If STATE is t, return a new state object seeded from the time of day.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional STATE)<a name="turn-off-auto-fill"></a>
<h3>Function: turn-off-auto-fill</h3>
Unconditionally turn off Auto Fill mode.<a name="tool-bar-add-item-from-menu"></a>
<h3>Function: tool-bar-add-item-from-menu</h3>
Define tool bar binding for COMMAND in keymap MAP using the given ICON.
This makes a binding for COMMAND in `tool-bar-map', copying its
binding from the menu bar in MAP (which defaults to `global-map'), but
modifies the binding by adding an image specification for ICON.  It
finds ICON just like `tool-bar-add-item'.  PROPS are additional
properties to add to the binding.</p>
<p>
MAP must contain appropriate binding for `[menu-bar]' which holds a keymap.</p>
<p>
Use this function only to make bindings in the global value of `tool-bar-map'.
To define items in any other map, use `tool-bar-local-item-from-menu'.<a name="make-command-summary"></a>
<h3>Function: make-command-summary</h3>
Make a summary of current key bindings in the buffer *Summary*.
Previous contents of that buffer are killed first.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="copyright-fix-years"></a>
<h3>Function: copyright-fix-years</h3>
Convert 2 digit years to 4 digit years.
Uses heuristic: year >= 50 means 19xx, < 50 means 20xx.
If `copyright-year-ranges' (which see) is non-nil, also
independently replaces consecutive years with a range.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="-find-last-index"></a>
<h3>Function: -find-last-index</h3>
Take a predicate PRED and a LIST and return the index of the
last element in the list satisfying the predicate, or nil if
there is no such element.</p>
<p>
See also `-last'.</p>
<p>
(fn PRED LIST)<a name="byte-compile-let"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-compile-let</h3>

(fn FORM)<a name="vc-git-stash-delete-at-point"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-git-stash-delete-at-point</h3></p>
<p>

(fn)<a name="comint-simple-send"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-simple-send</h3>
Default function for sending to PROC input STRING.
This just sends STRING plus a newline.  To override this,
set the hook `comint-input-sender'.</p>
<p>
(fn PROC STRING)<a name="use-hard-newlines"></a>
<h3>Function: use-hard-newlines</h3>
Toggle distinguishing between hard and soft newlines.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable the feature if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
it if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When enabled, the functions `newline' and `open-line' add the
text-property `hard' to newlines that they insert, and a line is
only considered as a candidate to match `paragraph-start' or
`paragraph-separate' if it follows a hard newline.</p>
<p>
When enabling, if there are newlines in the buffer but no hard
newlines, ask the user whether to mark as hard any newlines
preceding a `paragraph-start' line.  From a program, second arg
INSERT specifies whether to do this; it can be `never' to change
nothing, t or `always' to force marking, `guess' to try to do the
right thing with no questions, nil or anything else to ask the
user.</p>
<p>
Newlines not marked hard are called "soft", and are always internal
to paragraphs.  The fill functions insert and delete only soft newlines.<a name="sort-lines"></a>
<h3>Function: sort-lines</h3>
Sort lines in region alphabetically; argument means descending order.
Called from a program, there are three arguments:
REVERSE (non-nil means reverse order), BEG and END (region to sort).
The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects
the sort order.</p>
<p>
(fn REVERSE BEG END)<a name="hack-local-variables"></a>
<h3>Function: hack-local-variables</h3>
Parse and put into effect this buffer's local variables spec.
Uses `hack-local-variables-apply' to apply the variables.</p>
<p>
If MODE-ONLY is non-nil, all we do is check whether a "mode:"
is specified, and return the corresponding mode symbol, or nil.
In this case, we try to ignore minor-modes, and only return a
major-mode.</p>
<p>
If `enable-local-variables' or `local-enable-local-variables' is nil,
this function does nothing.  If `inhibit-local-variables-regexps'
applies to the file in question, the file is not scanned for
local variables, but directory-local variables may still be applied.<a name="replace"></a>
<h3>Function: replace</h3>
Replace the elements of SEQ1 with the elements of SEQ2.
SEQ1 is destructively modified, then returned.</p>
<p>
Keywords supported:  :start1 :end1 :start2 :end2</p>
<p>
(fn SEQ1 SEQ2 [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="cl-member-if"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-member-if</h3>
Find the first item satisfying PREDICATE in LIST.
Return the sublist of LIST whose car matches.</p>
<p>
Keywords supported:  :key</p>
<p>
(fn PREDICATE LIST [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="xesam-search"></a>
<h3>Function: xesam-search</h3>
Perform an interactive search.
ENGINE is the Xesam search engine to be applied, it must be one of the
entries of `xesam-search-engines'.  QUERY is the search string in the
Xesam user query language.  If the search engine does not support
the Xesam user query language, a Xesam fulltext search is applied.</p>
<p>
The default search engine is the first entry in `xesam-search-engines'.
Example:</p>
<p>
  (xesam-search (car (xesam-search-engines)) "emacs")</p>
<p>
(fn ENGINE QUERY)<a name="newsticker-running-p"></a>
<h3>Function: newsticker-running-p</h3>
Check whether newsticker is running.
Return t if newsticker is running, nil otherwise.  Newsticker is
considered to be running if the newsticker timer list is not empty.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="x-popup-menu"></a>
<h3>Function: x-popup-menu</h3>
Pop up a deck-of-cards menu and return user's selection.
POSITION is a position specification.  This is either a mouse button event
or a list ((XOFFSET YOFFSET) WINDOW)
where XOFFSET and YOFFSET are positions in pixels from the top left
corner of WINDOW.  (WINDOW may be a window or a frame object.)
This controls the position of the top left of the menu as a whole.
If POSITION is t, it means to use the current mouse position.</p>
<p>
MENU is a specifier for a menu.  For the simplest case, MENU is a keymap.
The menu items come from key bindings that have a menu string as well as
a definition; actually, the "definition" in such a key binding looks like
(STRING . REAL-DEFINITION).  To give the menu a title, put a string into
the keymap as a top-level element.</p>
<p>
If REAL-DEFINITION is nil, that puts a nonselectable string in the menu.
Otherwise, REAL-DEFINITION should be a valid key binding definition.</p>
<p>
You can also use a list of keymaps as MENU.
  Then each keymap makes a separate pane.</p>
<p>
When MENU is a keymap or a list of keymaps, the return value is the
list of events corresponding to the user's choice. Note that
`x-popup-menu' does not actually execute the command bound to that
sequence of events.</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify a menu of multiple panes
  with a list of the form (TITLE PANE1 PANE2...),
where each pane is a list of form (TITLE ITEM1 ITEM2...).
Each ITEM is normally a cons cell (STRING . VALUE);
but a string can appear as an item--that makes a nonselectable line
in the menu.
With this form of menu, the return value is VALUE from the chosen item.</p>
<p>
If POSITION is nil, don't display the menu at all, just precalculate the
cached information about equivalent key sequences.</p>
<p>
If the user gets rid of the menu without making a valid choice, for
instance by clicking the mouse away from a valid choice or by typing
keyboard input, then this normally results in a quit and
`x-popup-menu' does not return.  But if POSITION is a mouse button
event (indicating that the user invoked the menu with the mouse) then
no quit occurs and `x-popup-menu' returns nil.</p>
<p>
(fn POSITION MENU)<a name="byte-compile-file-form-eval"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-compile-file-form-eval</h3></p>
<p>

(fn FORM)<a name="dired-remember-marks"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-remember-marks</h3>
Return alist of files and their marks, from BEG to END.</p>
<p>
(fn BEG END)<a name="ring-insert"></a>
<h3>Function: ring-insert</h3>
Insert onto ring RING the item ITEM, as the newest (last) item.
If the ring is full, dump the oldest item to make room.<a name="dnsResolve"></a>
<h3>Function: dnsResolve</h3></p>
<p>

(fn HOST)<a name="ebnf-reset-style"></a>
<h3>Function: ebnf-reset-style</h3>
Reset current style.</p>
<p>
Returns the old style symbol.</p>
<p>
See `ebnf-style-database' documentation.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional STYLE)<a name="delete-windows-on"></a>
<h3>Function: delete-windows-on</h3>
Delete all windows showing BUFFER-OR-NAME.
BUFFER-OR-NAME may be a buffer or the name of an existing buffer
and defaults to the current buffer.</p>
<p>
The following non-nil values of the optional argument FRAME
have special meanings:</p>
<p>
- t means consider all windows on the selected frame only.</p>
<p>
- `visible' means consider all windows on all visible frames on
  the current terminal.</p>
<p>
- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible
  and iconified frames on the current terminal.</p>
<p>
- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.</p>
<p>
Any other value of FRAME means consider all windows on all
frames.</p>
<p>
When a window showing BUFFER-OR-NAME is dedicated and the only
window of its frame, that frame is deleted when there are other
frames left.<a name="hs-minor-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: hs-minor-mode</h3>
Minor mode to selectively hide/show code and comment blocks.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable the mode if ARG is positive,
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode
if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When hideshow minor mode is on, the menu bar is augmented with hideshow
commands and the hideshow commands are enabled.
The value '(hs . t) is added to `buffer-invisibility-spec'.</p>
<p>
The main commands are: `hs-hide-all', `hs-show-all', `hs-hide-block',
`hs-show-block', `hs-hide-level' and `hs-toggle-hiding'.  There is also
`hs-hide-initial-comment-block' and `hs-mouse-toggle-hiding'.</p>
<p>
Turning hideshow minor mode off reverts the menu bar and the
variables to default values and disables the hideshow commands.</p>
<p>
Lastly, the normal hook `hs-minor-mode-hook' is run using `run-hooks'.</p>
<p>
Key bindings:</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `hs-minor-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

(fn &optional ARG)<a name="view-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: view-mode</h3>
Toggle View mode, a minor mode for viewing text but not editing it.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable View mode if ARG is positive,
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable View mode
if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When View mode is enabled, commands that do not change the buffer
contents are available as usual.  Kill commands insert text in
kill buffers but do not delete.  Most other commands beep and
tell the user that the buffer is read-only.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `view-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

The following additional commands are provided.  Most commands
take prefix arguments.  Page commands default to "page size"
lines which is almost a whole window, or number of lines set by
M-x View-scroll-page-forward-set-page-size or M-x View-scroll-page-backward-set-page-size.
Half page commands default to and set "half page size" lines
which initially is half a window full.  Search commands default
to a repeat count of one.</p>
<p>
H, h, ?	 This message.
Digits	provide prefix arguments.
M--	negative prefix argument.
M-<	move to the beginning of buffer.
>	move to the end of buffer.
M-x View-scroll-to-buffer-end	scroll so that buffer end is at last line of window.
SPC	scroll forward "page size" lines.
	  With prefix scroll forward prefix lines.
DEL	scroll backward "page size" lines.
	  With prefix scroll backward prefix lines.
M-x View-scroll-page-forward-set-page-size	like  M-x View-scroll-page-forward  but with prefix sets "page size" to prefix.
M-x View-scroll-page-backward-set-page-size	like  M-x View-scroll-page-backward  but with prefix sets "page size" to prefix.
M-x View-scroll-half-page-forward	scroll forward "half page size" lines.  With prefix, sets
	  "half page size" to prefix lines and scrolls forward that much.
M-x View-scroll-half-page-backward	scroll backward "half page size" lines.  With prefix, sets
	  "half page size" to prefix lines and scrolls backward that much.
RET, LFD  scroll forward one line.  With prefix scroll forward prefix line(s).
y	scroll backward one line.  With prefix scroll backward prefix line(s).
M-x View-revert-buffer-scroll-page-forward	revert-buffer if necessary and scroll forward.
	  Use this to view a changing file.
M-x what-line	prints the current line number.
M-x View-goto-percent	goes prefix argument (default 100) percent into buffer.
M-x View-goto-line	goes to line given by prefix argument (default first line).
.	set the mark.
x	exchanges point and mark.
M-x View-back-to-mark	return to mark and pops mark ring.
	  Mark ring is pushed at start of every successful search and when
	  jump to line occurs.  The mark is set on jump to buffer start or end.
C-x r SPC	save current position in character register.
'	go to position saved in character register.
s	do forward incremental search.
r	do reverse incremental search.
M-x View-search-regexp-forward	searches forward for regular expression, starting after current page.
	  ! and @ have a special meaning at the beginning of the regexp.
	  ! means search for a line with no match for regexp.  @ means start
	  search at beginning (end for backward search) of buffer.
\	searches backward for regular expression, starting before current page.
M-x View-search-last-regexp-forward	searches forward for last regular expression.
p	searches backward for last regular expression.
M-x View-quit	quit View mode, restoring this window and buffer to previous state.
	  M-x View-quit is the normal way to leave view mode.
M-x View-exit	exit View mode but stay in current buffer.  Use this if you started
	  viewing a buffer (file) and find out you want to edit it.
	  This command restores the previous read-only status of the buffer.
M-x View-exit-and-edit	exit View mode, and make the current buffer editable
	  even if it was not editable before entry to View mode.
M-x View-quit-all	quit View mode, restoring all windows to previous state.
M-x View-leave	quit View mode and maybe switch buffers, but don't kill this buffer.
M-x View-kill-and-leave	quit View mode, kill current buffer and go back to other buffer.</p>
<p>
The effect of M-x View-leave, M-x View-quit and M-x View-kill-and-leave depends on how view-mode was entered.  If it was
entered by view-file, view-file-other-window, view-file-other-frame, or
M-x dired-view-file (M-x view-file, M-x view-file-other-window,
M-x view-file-other-frame, or the Dired mode v command),
then M-x View-quit will try to kill the current buffer.
If view-mode was entered from another buffer, by M-x view-buffer,
M-x view-buffer-other-window, M-x view-buffer-other frame, M-x view-file,
M-x view-file-other-window, or M-x view-file-other-frame,
then M-x View-leave, M-x View-quit and M-x View-kill-and-leave will return to that buffer.</p>
<p>
Entry to view-mode runs the normal hook `view-mode-hook'.</p>

<h3>Function: decrease-right-margin</h3>
Make the right margin of the region smaller.
With no prefix argument, decrease the right margin by `standard-indent'.
A prefix arg (optional third arg INC noninteractively) specifies the amount
of width to remove, in characters.  A negative argument increases
the right margin width.
If `auto-fill-mode' is active, re-fills region to fit in new margin.<a name="describe-distribution"></a>
<h3>Function: describe-distribution</h3>

<h3>Function: dirs</h3>
Resync the buffer's idea of the current directory stack.
This command queries the shell with the command bound to
`shell-dirstack-query' (default "dirs"), reads the next
line output and parses it to form the new directory stack.
DON'T issue this command unless the buffer is at a shell prompt.
Also, note that if some other subprocess decides to do output
immediately after the query, its output will be taken as the
new directory stack -- you lose.  If this happens, just do the
command again.</p>

(fn &rest SEQUENCES)<a name="server-visit-files"></a>
<h3>Function: server-visit-files</h3>
Find FILES and return a list of buffers created.
FILES is an alist whose elements are (FILENAME . FILEPOS)
where FILEPOS can be nil or a pair (LINENUMBER . COLUMNNUMBER).
PROC is the client that requested this operation.
NOWAIT non-nil means this client is not waiting for the results,
so don't mark these buffers specially, just visit them normally.</p>
<p>
(fn FILES PROC &optional NOWAIT)<a name="query-replace"></a>
<h3>Function: query-replace</h3>
Replace some occurrences of FROM-STRING with TO-STRING.
As each match is found, the user must type a character saying
what to do with it.  For directions, type C-h at that time.</p>
<p>
In Transient Mark mode, if the mark is active, operate on the contents
of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the end of the buffer.</p>
<p>
Use M-n to pull the last incremental search string to the minibuffer
that reads FROM-STRING, or invoke replacements from
incremental search with a key sequence like `C-s C-s M-%'
to use its current search string as the string to replace.</p>
<p>
Matching is independent of case if `case-fold-search' is non-nil and
FROM-STRING has no uppercase letters.  Replacement transfers the case
pattern of the old text to the new text, if `case-replace' and
`case-fold-search' are non-nil and FROM-STRING has no uppercase
letters.  (Transferring the case pattern means that if the old text
matched is all caps, or capitalized, then its replacement is upcased
or capitalized.)</p>
<p>
If `replace-lax-whitespace' is non-nil, a space or spaces in the string
to be replaced will match a sequence of whitespace chars defined by the
regexp in `search-whitespace-regexp'.</p>
<p>
Third arg DELIMITED (prefix arg if interactive), if non-nil, means replace
only matches surrounded by word boundaries.
Fourth and fifth arg START and END specify the region to operate on.</p>
<p>
To customize possible responses, change the "bindings" in `query-replace-map'.<a name="completion--cache-all-sorted-completions"></a>

Replace OLDDEF with NEWDEF for any keys in KEYMAP now defined as OLDDEF.
In other words, OLDDEF is replaced with NEWDEF where ever it appears.
Alternatively, if optional fourth argument OLDMAP is specified, we redefine
in KEYMAP as NEWDEF those keys which are defined as OLDDEF in OLDMAP.</p>
<p>
If you don't specify OLDMAP, you can usually get the same results
in a cleaner way with command remapping, like this:

<h3>Function: dired-maybe-insert-subdir</h3>
Insert this subdirectory into the same dired buffer.
If it is already present, just move to it (type M-x dired-do-redisplay to refresh),
  else inserts it at its natural place (as `ls -lR' would have done).
With a prefix arg, you may edit the ls switches used for this listing.
  You can add `R' to the switches to expand the whole tree starting at
  this subdirectory.
This function takes some pains to conform to `ls -lR' output.</p>
<p>
Dired remembers switches specified with a prefix arg, so that reverting
the buffer will not reset them.  However, using `dired-undo' to re-insert
or delete subdirectories can bypass this machinery.  Hence, you sometimes
may have to reset some subdirectory switches after a `dired-undo'.
You can reset all subdirectory switches to the default using
M-x dired-reset-subdir-switches.
See Info node `(emacs)Subdir switches' for more details.<a name="comint-previous-matching-input-string-position"></a>

The argument NLINES says how many lines to center.<a name="frame-geom-value-cons"></a>
<h3>Function: frame-geom-value-cons</h3>
Return equivalent geometry value for FRAME as a cons with car `+'.
A geometry value equivalent to VALUE for FRAME is returned,
where the value is a cons with car `+', not numeric.
TYPE is the car of the original geometry spec (TYPE . VALUE).
   It is `top' or `left', depending on which edge VALUE is related to.
VALUE is the cdr of a frame geometry spec: (left/top . VALUE).
If VALUE is a number, then it is converted to a cons value, perhaps
   relative to the opposite frame edge from that in the original spec.
FRAME defaults to the selected frame.</p>
<p>
Examples (measures in pixels) -
 Assuming display height/width=1024, frame height/width=600:
 300 inside display edge:                   300  => (+  300)
                                        (+  300) => (+  300)
 300 inside opposite display edge:      (-  300) => (+  124)
                                           -300  => (+  124)
 300 beyond display edge
  (= 724 inside opposite display edge): (+ -300) => (+ -300)
 300 beyond display edge
  (= 724 inside opposite display edge): (- -300) => (+  724)</p>

<h3>Function: byte-recompile-file</h3>
Recompile FILENAME file if it needs recompilation.
This happens when its `.elc' file is older than itself.</p>
<p>
If the `.elc' file exists and is up-to-date, normally this function
*does not* compile FILENAME.  If the prefix argument FORCE is non-nil,
however, it compiles FILENAME even if the destination already
exists and is up-to-date.</p>
<p>
If the `.elc' file does not exist, normally this function *does not*
compile FILENAME.  If optional argument ARG is 0, it compiles
the input file even if the `.elc' file does not exist.
Any other non-nil value of ARG means to ask the user.</p>
<p>
If optional argument LOAD is non-nil, loads the file after compiling.</p>

FILES may use abbreviations defined in `grep-files-aliases', e.g.
entering `ch' is equivalent to `*.[ch]'.</p>
<p>
With C-u prefix, you can edit the constructed shell command line
before it is executed.
With two C-u prefixes, directly edit and run `grep-find-command'.</p>
<p>
Collect output in a buffer.  While the recursive grep is running,
you can use C-x ` (M-x next-error), or 
Uses keymap `grep-mode-map', which is not currently defined.
M-x compile-goto-error in the grep output buffer,
to visit the lines where matches were found.  To kill the job
before it finishes, type M-x kill-compilation.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: set-fringe-style</h3>
Set the default appearance of fringes on the selected frame.
When called interactively, query the user for MODE; valid values
are `no-fringes', `default', `left-only', `right-only', `minimal'
and `half-width'.  See `fringe-styles'.</p>
<p>
When used in a Lisp program, MODE should be one of these:
- nil, which means the default width (8 pixels).
- a cons cell (LEFT . RIGHT), where LEFT and RIGHT are
  respectively the left and right fringe widths in pixels, or
  nil (meaning to disable that fringe).
- a single integer, which specifies the pixel widths of both
  fringes.
This command may round up the left and right width specifications
to ensure that their sum is a multiple of the character width of
a frame.  It never rounds up a fringe width of 0.</p>
<p>
Fringe widths set by `set-window-fringes' override the default
fringe widths set by this command.  If you want to set the
default appearance of fringes on all frames, see the command

<h3>Function: find-tag-other-window</h3>
Find tag (in current tags table) whose name contains TAGNAME.
Select the buffer containing the tag's definition in another window, and
move point there.  The default for TAGNAME is the expression in the buffer
around or before point.</p>
<p>
If second arg NEXT-P is t (interactively, with prefix arg), search for
another tag that matches the last tagname or regexp used.  When there are
multiple matches for a tag, more exact matches are found first.  If NEXT-P
is negative (interactively, with prefix arg that is a negative number or
just M--), pop back to the previous tag gone to.</p>
<p>
If third arg REGEXP-P is non-nil, treat TAGNAME as a regexp.</p>
<p>
A marker representing the point when this command is invoked is pushed

See the command `isearch-forward' for more information.<a name="mouse-on-link-p"></a>
<h3>Function: mouse-on-link-p</h3>
Return non-nil if POS is on a link in the current buffer.
POS must be a buffer position in the current buffer or a mouse
event location in the selected window (see `event-start').
However, if `mouse-1-click-in-non-selected-windows' is non-nil,
POS may be a mouse event location in any window.</p>
<p>
A clickable link is identified by one of the following methods:</p>
<p>
- If the character at POS has a non-nil `follow-link' text or
overlay property, the value of that property determines what to do.</p>
<p>
- If there is a local key-binding or a keybinding at position POS
for the `follow-link' event, the binding of that event determines
what to do.</p>
<p>
The resulting value determine whether POS is inside a link:</p>
<p>
- If the value is `mouse-face', POS is inside a link if there
is a non-nil `mouse-face' property at POS.  Return t in this case.</p>
<p>
- If the value is a function, FUNC, POS is inside a link if
the call (FUNC POS) returns non-nil.  Return the return value
from that call.  Arg is (posn-point POS) if POS is a mouse event.</p>
<p>
- Otherwise, return the value itself.</p>
<p>
The return value is interpreted as follows:</p>
<p>
- If it is a string, the mouse-1 event is translated into the
first character of the string, i.e. the action of the mouse-1
click is the local or global binding of that character.</p>
<p>
- If it is a vector, the mouse-1 event is translated into the
first element of that vector, i.e. the action of the mouse-1
click is the local or global binding of that event.</p>
<p>
- Otherwise, the mouse-1 event is translated into a mouse-2 event
at the same position.</p>

<p>
(fn FILE)<a name="custom-theme-set-variables"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-theme-set-variables</h3>
Initialize variables for theme THEME according to settings in ARGS.
Each of the arguments in ARGS should be a list of this form:</p>
<p>
  (SYMBOL EXP [NOW [REQUEST [COMMENT]]])</p>
<p>
SYMBOL is the variable name, and EXP is an expression which
evaluates to the customized value.  EXP will also be stored,
without evaluating it, in SYMBOL's `saved-value' property, so
that it can be restored via the Customize interface.  It is also
added to the alist in SYMBOL's `theme-value' property (by
calling `custom-push-theme').</p>
<p>
NOW, if present and non-nil, means to install the variable's
value directly now, even if its `defcustom' declaration has not
been executed.  This is for internal use only.</p>
<p>
REQUEST is a list of features to `require' (which are loaded
prior to evaluating EXP).</p>
<p>
COMMENT is a comment string about SYMBOL.<a name="vc-pull"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-pull</h3>
Update the current fileset or branch.
You must be visiting a version controlled file, or in a `vc-dir' buffer.
On a distributed version control system, this runs a "pull"
operation to update the current branch, prompting for an argument
list if required.  Optional prefix ARG forces a prompt.</p>
<p>
On a non-distributed version control system, update the current
fileset to the tip revisions.  For each unchanged and unlocked
file, this simply replaces the work file with the latest revision
on its branch.  If the file contains changes, any changes in the
tip revision are merged into the working file.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="prune-directory-list"></a>
<h3>Function: prune-directory-list</h3>
Return a copy of DIRS with all non-existent directories removed.
The optional argument KEEP is a list of directories to retain even if
they don't exist, and REJECT is a list of directories to remove from

<h3>Function: mail-extract-address-components</h3>
Given an RFC-822 address ADDRESS, extract full name and canonical address.
Returns a list of the form (FULL-NAME CANONICAL-ADDRESS).  If no
name can be extracted, FULL-NAME will be nil.  Also see
`mail-extr-ignore-single-names' and
`mail-extr-ignore-realname-equals-mailbox-name'.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument ALL is non-nil, then ADDRESS can contain zero
or more recipients, separated by commas, and we return a list of
the form ((FULL-NAME CANONICAL-ADDRESS) ...) with one element for
each recipient.  If ALL is nil, then if ADDRESS contains more than
one recipients, all but the first is ignored.</p>
<p>
ADDRESS may be a string or a buffer.  If it is a buffer, the visible
(narrowed) portion of the buffer will be interpreted as the address.
(This feature exists so that the clever caller might be able to avoid
consing a string.)</p>
<p>
(fn ADDRESS &optional ALL)<a name="test-completion"></a>
<h3>Function: test-completion</h3>
Return non-nil if STRING is a valid completion.

<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="commandp"></a>
<h3>Function: commandp</h3>
Non-nil if FUNCTION makes provisions for interactive calling.
This means it contains a description for how to read arguments to give it.
The value is nil for an invalid function or a symbol with no function
definition.</p>
<p>
Interactively callable functions include strings and vectors (treated
as keyboard macros), lambda-expressions that contain a top-level call
to `interactive', autoload definitions made by `autoload' with non-nil
fourth argument, and some of the built-in functions of Lisp.</p>
<p>
Also, a symbol satisfies `commandp' if its function definition does so.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument FOR-CALL-INTERACTIVELY is non-nil,
then strings and vectors are not accepted.</p>
<p>
(fn FUNCTION &optional FOR-CALL-INTERACTIVELY)<a name="intern-soft"></a>
<h3>Function: intern-soft</h3>
Return the canonical symbol named NAME, or nil if none exists.
NAME may be a string or a symbol.  If it is a symbol, that exact

WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
The return value includes the mode line and header line, if any.
If WINDOW is an internal window, the total height is the height
of the screen areas spanned by its children.</p>
<p>
On a graphical display, this total height is reported as an
integer multiple of the default character height.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: read-char-by-name</h3>
Read a character by its Unicode name or hex number string.
Display PROMPT and read a string that represents a character by its
Unicode property `name' or `old-name'.</p>
<p>
This function returns the character as a number.</p>
<p>
You can type a few of the first letters of the Unicode name and
use completion.  If you type a substring of the Unicode name
preceded by an asterisk `*' and use completion, it will show all
the characters whose names include that substring, not necessarily
at the beginning of the name.</p>
<p>
This function also accepts a hexadecimal number of Unicode code
point or a number in hash notation, e.g. #o21430 for octal,
#x2318 for hex, or #10r8984 for decimal.<a name="longlines-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: longlines-mode</h3>
Toggle Long Lines mode in this buffer.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Long Lines mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When Long Lines mode is enabled, long lines are wrapped if they
extend beyond `fill-column'.  The soft newlines used for line
wrapping will not show up when the text is yanked or saved to
disk.</p>
<p>
If the variable `longlines-auto-wrap' is non-nil, lines are
automatically wrapped whenever the buffer is changed.  You can
always call `fill-paragraph' to fill individual paragraphs.</p>
<p>
If the variable `longlines-show-hard-newlines' is non-nil, hard
newlines are indicated with a symbol.</p>

<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="indent-code-rigidly"></a>
<h3>Function: indent-code-rigidly</h3>
Indent all lines of code, starting in the region, sideways by ARG columns.
Does not affect lines starting inside comments or strings, assuming that
the start of the region is not inside them.</p>
<p>
Called from a program, takes args START, END, COLUMNS and NOCHANGE-REGEXP.
The last is a regexp which, if matched at the beginning of a line,
means don't indent that line.<a name="url-expand-file-name"></a>
<h3>Function: url-expand-file-name</h3>
Convert URL to a fully specified URL, and canonicalize it.
Second arg DEFAULT is a URL to start with if URL is relative.
If DEFAULT is nil or missing, the current buffer's URL is used.
Path components that are `.' are removed, and 
path components followed by `..' are removed, along with the `..' itself.<a name="gnus-delete-first"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-delete-first</h3>
Delete by side effect the first occurrence of ELT as a member of LIST.<a name="raise-sexp"></a>
<h3>Function: raise-sexp</h3>

information for all instrumented functions is reset after results are
displayed.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="customize-save-customized"></a>
<h3>Function: customize-save-customized</h3>
Save all user options which have been set in this session.<a name="kill-line"></a>
<h3>Function: kill-line</h3>
Kill the rest of the current line; if no nonblanks there, kill thru newline.
With prefix argument ARG, kill that many lines from point.
Negative arguments kill lines backward.
With zero argument, kills the text before point on the current line.</p>
<p>
When calling from a program, nil means "no arg",
a number counts as a prefix arg.</p>
<p>
To kill a whole line, when point is not at the beginning, type C-a C-k C-k.</p>
<p>
If `show-trailing-whitespace' is non-nil, this command will just
kill the rest of the current line, even if there are only
nonblanks there.</p>
<p>
If `kill-whole-line' is non-nil, then this command kills the whole line
including its terminating newline, when used at the beginning of a line
with no argument.  As a consequence, you can always kill a whole line
by typing C-a C-k.</p>
<p>
If you want to append the killed line to the last killed text,
use C-M-w before C-k.</p>
<p>
If the buffer is read-only, Emacs will beep and refrain from deleting
the line, but put the line in the kill ring anyway.  This means that
you can use this command to copy text from a read-only buffer.
(If the variable `kill-read-only-ok' is non-nil, then this won't
even beep.)<a name="vc-working-revision"></a>

modified to specify (INDEX R G B) as its cdr.  Otherwise, ELT is
appended to the end of the color alist.
If FRAME is unspecified or nil, it defaults to the selected frame.
Value is the modified color alist for FRAME.<a name="window-redisplay-end-trigger"></a>
<h3>Function: window-redisplay-end-trigger</h3>

(fn ARGLIST)<a name="c-guess-region-no-install"></a>
<h3>Function: c-guess-region-no-install</h3>
Guess the style on the region; don't install it.</p>
<p>
Every line of code in the region is examined and values for the following two
variables are guessed:</p>
<p>
* `c-basic-offset', and
* the indentation values of the various syntactic symbols in
  `c-offsets-alist'.</p>
<p>
The guessed values are put into `c-guess-guessed-basic-offset' and
`c-guess-guessed-offsets-alist'.</p>
<p>
Frequencies of use are taken into account when guessing, so minor
inconsistencies in the indentation style shouldn't produce wrong guesses.</p>
<p>
If given a prefix argument (or if the optional argument ACCUMULATE is
non-nil) then the previous examination is extended, otherwise a new
guess is made from scratch.</p>
<p>
Note that the larger the region to guess in, the slower the guessing.
So you can limit the region with `c-guess-region-max'.</p>
<p>
(fn START END &optional ACCUMULATE)<a name="load-history-regexp"></a>
<h3>Function: load-history-regexp</h3>
Form a regexp to find FILE in `load-history'.

If the theme is not considered safe by `custom-safe-themes',
prompt the user for confirmation before loading it.  But if
optional arg NO-CONFIRM is non-nil, load the theme without
prompting.</p>
<p>
Normally, this function also enables THEME.  If optional arg
NO-ENABLE is non-nil, load the theme but don't enable it, unless
the theme was already enabled.</p>
<p>
This function is normally called through Customize when setting
`custom-enabled-themes'.  If used directly in your init file, it

<h3>Function: rename-uniquely</h3>
Rename current buffer to a similar name not already taken.
This function is useful for creating multiple shell process buffers
or multiple mail buffers, etc.</p>
<p>
Note that some commands, in particular those based on `compilation-mode'
(`compile', `grep', etc.) will reuse the current buffer if it has the
appropriate mode even if it has been renamed.  So as well as renaming
the buffer, you also need to switch buffers before running another
instance of such commands.<a name="load-library"></a>
<h3>Function: load-library</h3>

Non-nil arg (prefix arg) means append to last macro defined.</p>
<p>
With C-u prefix, append to last keyboard macro
defined.  Depending on `kmacro-execute-before-append', this may begin
by re-executing the last macro as if you typed it again.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, it sets `kmacro-counter' to ARG or 0 if missing before
defining the macro.</p>
<p>
Use C-x C-k TAB to insert (and increment) the macro counter.

(fn START-EVENT)<a name="jit-lock-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: jit-lock-mode</h3>
Toggle Just-in-time Lock mode.
Turn Just-in-time Lock mode on if and only if ARG is non-nil.
Enable it automatically by customizing group `font-lock'.</p>
<p>
When Just-in-time Lock mode is enabled, fontification is different in the
following ways:</p>
<p>
- Demand-driven buffer fontification triggered by Emacs C code.
  This means initial fontification of the whole buffer does not occur.
  Instead, fontification occurs when necessary, such as when scrolling
  through the buffer would otherwise reveal unfontified areas.  This is
  useful if buffer fontification is too slow for large buffers.</p>
<p>
- Stealthy buffer fontification if `jit-lock-stealth-time' is non-nil.
  This means remaining unfontified areas of buffers are fontified if Emacs has
  been idle for `jit-lock-stealth-time' seconds, while Emacs remains idle.
  This is useful if any buffer has any deferred fontification.</p>
<p>
- Deferred context fontification if `jit-lock-contextually' is
  non-nil.  This means fontification updates the buffer corresponding to
  true syntactic context, after `jit-lock-context-time' seconds of Emacs
  idle time, while Emacs remains idle.  Otherwise, fontification occurs
  on modified lines only, and subsequent lines can remain fontified
  corresponding to previous syntactic contexts.  This is useful where
  strings or comments span lines.</p>
<p>
Stealth fontification only occurs while the system remains unloaded.
If the system load rises above `jit-lock-stealth-load' percent, stealth
fontification is suspended.  Stealth fontification intensity is controlled via
the variable `jit-lock-stealth-nice'.<a name="gnus-sieve-update"></a>

<h3>Function: vc-next-action</h3>
Do the next logical version control operation on the current fileset.
This requires that all files in the current VC fileset be in the
same state.  If not, signal an error.</p>
<p>
For merging-based version control systems:
  If every file in the VC fileset is not registered for version
   control, register the fileset (but don't commit).
  If every work file in the VC fileset is added or changed, pop
   up a *vc-log* buffer to commit the fileset.
  For a centralized version control system, if any work file in
   the VC fileset is out of date, offer to update the fileset.</p>
<p>
For old-style locking-based version control systems, like RCS:
  If every file is not registered, register the file(s).
  If every file is registered and unlocked, check out (lock)
   the file(s) for editing.
  If every file is locked by you and has changes, pop up a
   *vc-log* buffer to check in the changes.  If the variable
   `vc-keep-workfiles' is non-nil (the default), leave a
   read-only copy of each changed file after checking in.
  If every file is locked by you and unchanged, unlock them.
  If every file is locked by someone else, offer to steal the lock.</p>

If the file `~/.emacs_SCHEMENAME' or `~/.emacs.d/init_SCHEMENAME.scm' exists,
it is given as initial input.
Note that this may lose due to a timing error if the Scheme processor
discards input when it starts up.
Runs the hook `inferior-scheme-mode-hook' (after the `comint-mode-hook'
is run).

`flycheck-CHECKER-executable' to EXECUTABLE.  Signal
`user-error', if EXECUTABLE does not denote a command or an
executable file.</p>
<p>
This command is intended for interactive use only.  In Lisp, just
`let'-bind the corresponding variable, or set it directly.  Use
`flycheck-checker-executable-variable' to obtain the executable

<h3>Function: temp-buffer-resize-mode</h3>
Toggle auto-resizing temporary buffer windows (Temp Buffer Resize Mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Temp Buffer Resize mode if ARG
is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,
enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When Temp Buffer Resize mode is enabled, the windows in which we
show a temporary buffer are automatically resized in height to
fit the buffer's contents, but never more than
`temp-buffer-max-height' nor less than `window-min-height'.</p>
<p>
A window is resized only if it has been specially created for the
buffer.  Windows that have shown another buffer before are not
resized.  A frame is resized only if `fit-frame-to-buffer' is
non-nil.</p>

<p>
(fn &optional COMMAND ARG)<a name="set-face-underline-p"></a>
<h3>Function: set-face-underline-p</h3>
Specify whether face FACE is underlined.
UNDERLINE nil means FACE explicitly doesn't underline.
UNDERLINE t means FACE underlines with its foreground color.
If UNDERLINE is a string, underline with that color.</p>
<p>
UNDERLINE may also be a list of the form (:color COLOR :style STYLE),
where COLOR is a string or `foreground-color', and STYLE is either
`line' or `wave'.  :color may be omitted, which means to use the
foreground color.  :style may be omitted, which means to use a line.</p>
<p>
FRAME nil or not specified means change face on all frames.
Use `set-face-attribute' to ``unspecify'' underlining.<a name="deactivate-mark"></a>
<h3>Function: deactivate-mark</h3>
Deactivate the mark.
If Transient Mark mode is disabled, this function normally does
nothing; but if FORCE is non-nil, it deactivates the mark anyway.</p>

Deactivating the mark sets `mark-active' to nil, updates the
primary selection according to `select-active-regions', and runs
`deactivate-mark-hook'.</p>
<p>
If Transient Mark mode was temporarily enabled, reset the value
of the variable `transient-mark-mode'; if this causes Transient
Mark mode to be disabled, don't change `mark-active' to nil or

<p>
(fn)<a name="find-image"></a>
<h3>Function: find-image</h3>
Find an image, choosing one of a list of image specifications.</p>
<p>
SPECS is a list of image specifications.</p>
<p>
Each image specification in SPECS is a property list.  The contents of
a specification are image type dependent.  All specifications must at
least contain the properties `:type TYPE' and either `:file FILE' or
`:data DATA', where TYPE is a symbol specifying the image type,
e.g. `xbm', FILE is the file to load the image from, and DATA is a
string containing the actual image data.  The specification whose TYPE
is supported, and FILE exists, is used to construct the image
specification to be returned.  Return nil if no specification is
satisfied.</p>
<p>
The image is looked for in `image-load-path'.</p>
<p>
Image files should not be larger than specified by `max-image-size'.<a name="call-process-shell-command"></a>
<h3>Function: call-process-shell-command</h3>
Execute the shell command COMMAND synchronously in separate process.
The remaining arguments are optional.
The program's input comes from file INFILE (nil means `/dev/null').
Insert output in BUFFER before point; t means current buffer;
 nil for BUFFER means discard it; 0 means discard and don't wait.
BUFFER can also have the form (REAL-BUFFER STDERR-FILE); in that case,
REAL-BUFFER says what to do with standard output, as above,
while STDERR-FILE says what to do with standard error in the child.
STDERR-FILE may be nil (discard standard error output),
t (mix it with ordinary output), or a file name string.</p>
<p>
Fourth arg DISPLAY non-nil means redisplay buffer as output is inserted.
Remaining arguments are strings passed as additional arguments for COMMAND.
Wildcards and redirection are handled as usual in the shell.</p>
<p>
If BUFFER is 0, `call-process-shell-command' returns immediately with value nil.
Otherwise it waits for COMMAND to terminate and returns a numeric exit
status or a signal description string.
If you quit, the process is killed with SIGINT, or SIGKILL if you quit again.<a name="window-list-1"></a>
<h3>Function: window-list-1</h3>
Return a list of all live windows.
WINDOW specifies the first window to list and defaults to the selected
window.</p>
<p>
Optional argument MINIBUF nil or omitted means consider the minibuffer
window only if the minibuffer is active.  MINIBUF t means consider the
minibuffer window even if the minibuffer is not active.  Any other value
means do not consider the minibuffer window even if the minibuffer is
active.</p>
<p>
Optional argument ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted means consider all windows
on WINDOW's frame, plus the minibuffer window if specified by the
MINIBUF argument.  If the minibuffer counts, consider all windows on all
frames that share that minibuffer too.  The following non-nil values of
ALL-FRAMES have special meanings:</p>
<p>
- t means consider all windows on all existing frames.</p>
<p>
- `visible' means consider all windows on all visible frames.</p>
<p>
- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible and
  iconified frames.</p>
<p>
- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.</p>
<p>
Anything else means consider all windows on WINDOW's frame and no
others.</p>
<p>
If WINDOW is not on the list of windows returned, some other window will
be listed first but no error is signaled.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WINDOW MINIBUF ALL-FRAMES)<a name="seq-drop-while"></a>

<p>
(fn STRING)<a name="octave-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: octave-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing Octave code.</p>
<p>
This mode makes it easier to write Octave code by helping with
indentation, doing some of the typing for you (with Abbrev mode) and by
showing keywords, comments, strings, etc. in different faces (with
Font Lock mode on terminals that support it).</p>
<p>
Octave itself is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for
solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.  Function definitions
can also be stored in files, and it can be used in a batch mode (which
is why you need this mode!).</p>
<p>
The latest released version of Octave is always available via anonymous
ftp from ftp.octave.org in the directory `/pub/octave'.  Complete
source and binaries for several popular systems are available.</p>
<p>
Type M-x list-abbrevs to display the built-in abbrevs for Octave keywords.</p>
<p>
Keybindings
===========</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `octave-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

Variables you can use to customize Octave mode
==============================================</p>
<p>
`octave-blink-matching-block'
  Non-nil means show matching begin of block when inserting a space,
  newline or semicolon after an else or end keyword.  Default is t.</p>
<p>
`octave-block-offset'
  Extra indentation applied to statements in block structures.
  Default is 2.</p>
<p>
`octave-continuation-offset'
  Extra indentation applied to Octave continuation lines.
  Default is 4.</p>
<p>
`octave-continuation-string'
  String used for Octave continuation lines.
  Default is a backslash.</p>
<p>
`octave-send-echo-input'
  Non-nil means always display `inferior-octave-buffer' after sending a
  command to the inferior Octave process.</p>
<p>
`octave-send-line-auto-forward'
  Non-nil means always go to the next unsent line of Octave code after
  sending a line to the inferior Octave process.</p>
<p>
`octave-send-echo-input'
  Non-nil means echo input sent to the inferior Octave process.</p>
<p>
Turning on Octave mode runs the hook `octave-mode-hook'.</p>
<p>
To begin using this mode for all `.m' files that you edit, add the
following lines to your init file:</p>
<p>
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.m\\'" . octave-mode))</p>
<p>
To automatically turn on the abbrev and auto-fill features,
add the following lines to your init file as well:</p>
<p>
  (add-hook 'octave-mode-hook
	    (lambda ()
	      (abbrev-mode 1)
	      (auto-fill-mode 1)))</p>
<p>
To submit a problem report, enter M-x octave-submit-bug-report from an Octave mode buffer.
This automatically sets up a mail buffer with version information
already added.  You just need to add a description of the problem,
including a reproducible test case and send the message.</p>

Optional argument IGNORE non-nil means ignore restrictions
imposed by fixed size windows, `window-min-height' or
`window-min-width' settings.  If IGNORE is a window, ignore
restrictions for that window only.  If IGNORE equals `safe',
live windows may get as small as `window-safe-min-height' lines
and `window-safe-min-width' columns.  Any other non-nil value
means ignore all of the above restrictions for all windows.<a name="custom-group-reset-standard"></a>

The `X' command aborts sending the message so that you can edit the buffer.</p>
<p>
To spell-check whenever a message is sent, include the appropriate lines
in your init file:
   (add-hook 'message-send-hook 'ispell-message)  ;; GNUS 5
   (add-hook 'news-inews-hook 'ispell-message)    ;; GNUS 4
   (add-hook 'mail-send-hook  'ispell-message)
   (add-hook 'mh-before-send-letter-hook 'ispell-message)</p>
<p>
You can bind this to the key C-c i in GNUS or mail by adding to
`news-reply-mode-hook' or `mail-mode-hook' the following lambda expression:
   (function (lambda () (local-set-key "\C-ci" 'ispell-message)))<a name="image-dired-dired-edit-comment-and-tags"></a>
<h3>Function: image-dired-dired-edit-comment-and-tags</h3>
Edit comment and tags of current or marked image files.
Edit comment and tags for all marked image files in an
easy-to-use form.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="frame-height"></a>
<h3>Function: frame-height</h3>
Return number of lines available for display on FRAME.
If FRAME is omitted, describe the currently selected frame.
Exactly what is included in the return value depends on the
window-system and toolkit in use - see `frame-pixel-height' for
more details.  The lines are in units of the default font height.</p>
<p>
The result is roughly related to the frame pixel height via
height in pixels = height in lines * `frame-char-height'.
However, this is only approximate, and is complicated e.g. by the
fact that individual window lines and menu bar lines can have
differing font heights.<a name="replace-regexp-in-string"></a>
<h3>Function: replace-regexp-in-string</h3>
Replace all matches for REGEXP with REP in STRING.</p>
<p>
Return a new string containing the replacements.</p>
<p>
Optional arguments FIXEDCASE, LITERAL and SUBEXP are like the
arguments with the same names of function `replace-match'.  If START
is non-nil, start replacements at that index in STRING.</p>
<p>
REP is either a string used as the NEWTEXT arg of `replace-match' or a
function.  If it is a function, it is called with the actual text of each
match, and its value is used as the replacement text.  When REP is called,
the match data are the result of matching REGEXP against a substring
of STRING.</p>
<p>
To replace only the first match (if any), make REGEXP match up to \'
and replace a sub-expression, e.g.
  (replace-regexp-in-string "\\(foo\\).*\\'" "bar" " foo foo" nil nil 1)
    => " bar foo"<a name="iconify-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: iconify-frame</h3>
Make the frame FRAME into an icon.
If omitted, FRAME defaults to the currently selected frame.</p>

Process a (un|back|splice)quote inside a backquote.
This simply recurses through the body.<a name="sleep-for"></a>
<h3>Function: sleep-for</h3>
Pause, without updating display, for SECONDS seconds.
SECONDS may be a floating-point value, meaning that you can wait for a
fraction of a second.  Optional second arg MILLISECONDS specifies an
additional wait period, in milliseconds; this is for backwards compatibility.
(Not all operating systems support waiting for a fraction of a second.)</p>
<p>
(fn SECONDS &optional MILLISECONDS)<a name="custom-group-reset-saved"></a>

<p>

(fn CONT &optional SIGN)<a name="make-backup-file-name"></a>
<h3>Function: make-backup-file-name</h3>
Create the non-numeric backup file name for FILE.
Normally this will just be the file's name with `~' appended.
Customization hooks are provided as follows.</p>
<p>
If the variable `make-backup-file-name-function' is non-nil, its value
should be a function which will be called with FILE as its argument;
the resulting name is used.</p>
<p>
Otherwise a match for FILE is sought in `backup-directory-alist'; see
the documentation of that variable.  If the directory for the backup
doesn't exist, it is created.<a name="cd"></a>
<h3>Function: cd</h3>
Make DIR become the current buffer's default directory.
If your environment includes a `CDPATH' variable, try each one of
that list of directories (separated by occurrences of
`path-separator') when resolving a relative directory name.
The path separator is colon in GNU and GNU-like systems.<a name="get-window-with-predicate"></a>
<h3>Function: get-window-with-predicate</h3>
Return a live window satisfying PREDICATE.
More precisely, cycle through all windows calling the function
PREDICATE on each one of them with the window as its sole
argument.  Return the first window for which PREDICATE returns
non-nil.  Windows are scanned starting with the window following
the selected window.  If no window satisfies PREDICATE, return
DEFAULT.</p>
<p>
MINIBUF t means include the minibuffer window even if the
minibuffer is not active.  MINIBUF nil or omitted means include
the minibuffer window only if the minibuffer is active.  Any
other value means do not include the minibuffer window even if
the minibuffer is active.</p>
<p>
ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted means consider all windows on the selected
frame, plus the minibuffer window if specified by the MINIBUF
argument.  If the minibuffer counts, consider all windows on all
frames that share that minibuffer too.  The following non-nil
values of ALL-FRAMES have special meanings:</p>
<p>
- t means consider all windows on all existing frames.</p>
<p>
- `visible' means consider all windows on all visible frames on
  the current terminal.</p>
<p>
- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible
  and iconified frames on the current terminal.</p>
<p>
- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.</p>
<p>
Anything else means consider all windows on the selected frame
and no others.<a name="format-decode-run-method"></a>
<h3>Function: format-decode-run-method</h3>

<p>
(fn)<a name="dash--match-vector-1"></a>
<h3>Function: dash--match-vector-1</h3>
Match MATCH-FORM against SOURCE.</p>
<p>
MATCH-FORM is a vector.  Each element of MATCH-FORM is either a
symbol, which gets bound to the respective value in source or
another match form which gets destructured recursively.</p>
<p>
If second-from-last place in MATCH-FORM is the symbol &rest, the
next element of the MATCH-FORM is matched against the tail of
SOURCE, starting at index of the &rest symbol.  This is
conceptually the same as the (head . tail) match for improper
lists, where dot plays the role of &rest.</p>
<p>
SOURCE is a vector.</p>
<p>
If the MATCH-FORM vector is shorter than SOURCE vector, only
the (length MATCH-FORM) places are bound, the rest of the SOURCE
is discarded.</p>
<p>
(fn MATCH-FORM SOURCE)<a name="url-file-local-copy"></a>
<h3>Function: url-file-local-copy</h3>

positions (integers or markers) specifying the region.<a name="visible-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: visible-mode</h3>
Toggle making all invisible text temporarily visible (Visible mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Visible mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable

<h3>Function: face-id</h3>
Return the internal ID of face with name FACE.
If FACE is a face-alias, return the ID of the target face.
The optional argument FRAME is ignored, since the internal face ID
of a face name is the same for all frames.<a name="fill-paragraph"></a>
<h3>Function: fill-paragraph</h3>
Fill paragraph at or after point.</p>
<p>
If JUSTIFY is non-nil (interactively, with prefix argument), justify as well.
If `sentence-end-double-space' is non-nil, then period followed by one
space does not end a sentence, so don't break a line there.
The variable `fill-column' controls the width for filling.</p>
<p>
If `fill-paragraph-function' is non-nil, we call it (passing our
argument to it), and if it returns non-nil, we simply return its value.</p>
<p>
If `fill-paragraph-function' is nil, return the `fill-prefix' used for filling.</p>
<p>
The REGION argument is non-nil if called interactively; in that
case, if Transient Mark mode is enabled and the mark is active,
call `fill-region' to fill each of the paragraphs in the active
region, instead of just filling the current paragraph.<a name="file-name-completion"></a>
<h3>Function: file-name-completion</h3>

<h3>Function: highlight-lines-matching-regexp</h3>
Set face of all lines containing a match of REGEXP to FACE.
Interactively, prompt for REGEXP then FACE, using a buffer-local
history list for REGEXP and a global history list for FACE.</p>
<p>
If Font Lock mode is enabled in the buffer, it is used to
highlight REGEXP.  If Font Lock mode is disabled, overlays are
used for highlighting; in this case, the highlighting will not be
updated as you type.</p>
<p>
(fn REGEXP &optional FACE)<a name="file-attributes"></a>
<h3>Function: file-attributes</h3>
Return a list of attributes of file FILENAME.
Value is nil if specified file cannot be opened.</p>
<p>
ID-FORMAT specifies the preferred format of attributes uid and gid (see
below) - valid values are 'string and 'integer.  The latter is the
default, but we plan to change that, so you should specify a non-nil value
for ID-FORMAT if you use the returned uid or gid.</p>
<p>
Elements of the attribute list are:
 0. t for directory, string (name linked to) for symbolic link, or nil.
 1. Number of links to file.
 2. File uid as a string or a number.  If a string value cannot be
  looked up, a numeric value, either an integer or a float, is returned.
 3. File gid, likewise.
 4. Last access time, as a list of integers (HIGH LOW USEC PSEC) in the
  same style as (current-time).
  (See a note below about access time on FAT-based filesystems.)
 5. Last modification time, likewise.  This is the time of the last
  change to the file's contents.
 6. Last status change time, likewise.  This is the time of last change
  to the file's attributes: owner and group, access mode bits, etc.
 7. Size in bytes.
  This is a floating point number if the size is too large for an integer.
 8. File modes, as a string of ten letters or dashes as in ls -l.
 9. t if file's gid would change if file were deleted and recreated.
10. inode number.  If it is larger than what an Emacs integer can hold,
  this is of the form (HIGH . LOW): first the high bits, then the low 16 bits.
  If even HIGH is too large for an Emacs integer, this is instead of the form
  (HIGH MIDDLE . LOW): first the high bits, then the middle 24 bits,
  and finally the low 16 bits.
11. Filesystem device number.  If it is larger than what the Emacs
  integer can hold, this is a cons cell, similar to the inode number.</p>
<p>
On most filesystems, the combination of the inode and the device
number uniquely identifies the file.</p>
<p>
On MS-Windows, performance depends on `w32-get-true-file-attributes',
which see.</p>
<p>
On some FAT-based filesystems, only the date of last access is recorded,
so last access time will always be midnight of that day.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: org-store-link</h3></p>
<p>
Uses keymap `org-mode-map', which is not currently defined.
Store an org-link to the current location.
This link is added to `org-stored-links' and can later be inserted
into an org-buffer with M-x org-insert-link.</p>
<p>
For some link types, a prefix arg is interpreted:
For links to usenet articles, arg negates `org-gnus-prefer-web-links'.

<h3>Function: html-line</h3>
HTML line break tag.</p>
<p>
This is a skeleton command (see `skeleton-insert').
Normally the skeleton text is inserted at point, with nothing "inside".
If there is a highlighted region, the skeleton text is wrapped
around the region text.</p>
<p>
A prefix argument ARG says to wrap the skeleton around the next ARG words.
A prefix argument of -1 says to wrap around region, even if not highlighted.
A prefix argument of zero says to wrap around zero words---that is, nothing.
This is a way of overriding the use of a highlighted region.<a name="flycheck-locate-config-file-by-path"></a>

<h3>Function: url-http-clean-headers</h3>
Remove trailing  from header lines.
This allows us to use `mail-fetch-field', etc.
Return the number of characters removed.<a name="backward-delete-char-untabify"></a>
<h3>Function: backward-delete-char-untabify</h3>
Delete characters backward, changing tabs into spaces.
The exact behavior depends on `backward-delete-char-untabify-method'.
Delete ARG chars, and kill (save in kill ring) if KILLP is non-nil.
Interactively, ARG is the prefix arg (default 1)
and KILLP is t if a prefix arg was specified.<a name="name-last-kbd-macro"></a>
<h3>Function: name-last-kbd-macro</h3>
Assign a name to the last keyboard macro defined.
Argument SYMBOL is the name to define.
The symbol's function definition becomes the keyboard macro string.
Such a "function" cannot be called from Lisp, but it is a valid editor command.<a name="find-font"></a>
<h3>Function: find-font</h3>
Return a font-entity matching with FONT-SPEC on the current frame.
Optional 2nd argument FRAME, if non-nil, specifies the target frame.</p>

<h3>Function: auth-source-format-cache-entry</h3>
Format SPEC entry to put it in the password cache.<a name="shell-directory-tracker"></a>
<h3>Function: shell-directory-tracker</h3>
Tracks cd, pushd and popd commands issued to the shell.
This function is called on each input passed to the shell.
It watches for cd, pushd and popd commands and sets the buffer's
default directory to track these commands.</p>
<p>
You may toggle this tracking on and off with M-x shell-dirtrack-mode.
If Emacs gets confused, you can resync with the shell with M-x dirs.
(The `dirtrack' package provides an alternative implementation of this
feature - see the function `dirtrack-mode'.)</p>
<p>
See variables `shell-cd-regexp', `shell-chdrive-regexp', `shell-pushd-regexp',
and  `shell-popd-regexp', while `shell-pushd-tohome', `shell-pushd-dextract',
and `shell-pushd-dunique' control the behavior of the relevant command.</p>

<p>
(fn LIST1 LIST2)<a name="set-face-inverse-video-p"></a>
<h3>Function: set-face-inverse-video-p</h3>
Specify whether face FACE is in inverse video.
INVERSE-VIDEO-P non-nil means FACE displays explicitly in inverse video.
INVERSE-VIDEO-P nil means FACE explicitly is not in inverse video.
FRAME nil or not specified means change face on all frames.
Use `set-face-attribute' to ``unspecify'' the inverse video attribute.<a name="dash--vector-tail"></a>
<h3>Function: dash--vector-tail</h3>
Return the tail of SEQ starting at START.</p>
<p>
(fn SEQ START)<a name="bookmark-locate"></a>
<h3>Function: bookmark-locate</h3>
Insert the name of the file associated with BOOKMARK-NAME.</p>
<p>
Optional second arg NO-HISTORY means don't record this in the
minibuffer history list `bookmark-history'.</p>
<p>
(fn BOOKMARK-NAME &optional NO-HISTORY)<a name="completing-read"></a>
<h3>Function: completing-read</h3>
Read a string in the minibuffer, with completion.
PROMPT is a string to prompt with; normally it ends in a colon and a space.
COLLECTION can be a list of strings, an alist, an obarray or a hash table.
COLLECTION can also be a function to do the completion itself.
PREDICATE limits completion to a subset of COLLECTION.
See `try-completion' and `all-completions' for more details
 on completion, COLLECTION, and PREDICATE.</p>
<p>
REQUIRE-MATCH can take the following values:
- t means that the user is not allowed to exit unless
  the input is (or completes to) an element of COLLECTION or is null.
- nil means that the user can exit with any input.
- `confirm' means that the user can exit with any input, but she needs
  to confirm her choice if the input is not an element of COLLECTION.
- `confirm-after-completion' means that the user can exit with any
  input, but she needs to confirm her choice if she called
  `minibuffer-complete' right before `minibuffer-complete-and-exit'
  and the input is not an element of COLLECTION.
- anything else behaves like t except that typing RET does not exit if it
  does non-null completion.</p>
<p>
If the input is null, `completing-read' returns DEF, or the first element
of the list of default values, or an empty string if DEF is nil,
regardless of the value of REQUIRE-MATCH.</p>
<p>
If INITIAL-INPUT is non-nil, insert it in the minibuffer initially,
  with point positioned at the end.
  If it is (STRING . POSITION), the initial input is STRING, but point
  is placed at _zero-indexed_ position POSITION in STRING.  (*Note*
  that this is different from `read-from-minibuffer' and related
  functions, which use one-indexing for POSITION.)  This feature is
  deprecated--it is best to pass nil for INITIAL-INPUT and supply the
  default value DEF instead.  The user can yank the default value into
  the minibuffer easily using M-n.</p>
<p>
HIST, if non-nil, specifies a history list and optionally the initial
  position in the list.  It can be a symbol, which is the history list
  variable to use, or it can be a cons cell (HISTVAR . HISTPOS).  In
  that case, HISTVAR is the history list variable to use, and HISTPOS
  is the initial position (the position in the list used by the
  minibuffer history commands).  For consistency, you should also
  specify that element of the history as the value of
  INITIAL-INPUT.  (This is the only case in which you should use
  INITIAL-INPUT instead of DEF.)  Positions are counted starting from
  1 at the beginning of the list.  The variable `history-length'
  controls the maximum length of a history list.</p>
<p>
DEF, if non-nil, is the default value or the list of default values.</p>
<p>
If INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD is non-nil, the minibuffer inherits
  the current input method and the setting of `enable-multibyte-characters'.</p>
<p>
Completion ignores case if the ambient value of
  `completion-ignore-case' is non-nil.</p>
<p>
See also `completing-read-function'.</p>

(fn PROMPT COLLECTION &optional PREDICATE REQUIRE-MATCH INITIAL-INPUT HIST DEF INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD)<a name="read-event"></a>
<h3>Function: read-event</h3>
Read an event object from the input stream.
If the optional argument PROMPT is non-nil, display that as a prompt.
If the optional argument INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD is non-nil and some
input method is turned on in the current buffer, that input method
is used for reading a character.
If the optional argument SECONDS is non-nil, it should be a number
specifying the maximum number of seconds to wait for input.  If no
input arrives in that time, return nil.  SECONDS may be a
floating-point value.</p>
<p>

<h3>Function: kill-backward-up-list</h3>
Kill the form containing the current sexp, leaving the sexp itself.
A prefix argument ARG causes the relevant number of surrounding
forms to be removed.
This command assumes point is not in a string or comment.<a name="line-move-to-column"></a>
<h3>Function: line-move-to-column</h3>
Try to find column COL, considering invisibility.
This function works only in certain cases,
because what we really need is for `move-to-column'
and `current-column' to be able to ignore invisible text.<a name="rng-c-load-schema"></a>
<h3>Function: rng-c-load-schema</h3>
Load a schema in RELAX NG compact syntax from FILENAME.
Return a pattern.</p>
<p>
(fn FILENAME)<a name="x-own-selection-internal"></a>
<h3>Function: x-own-selection-internal</h3>
Assert an X selection of the type SELECTION with and value VALUE.
SELECTION is a symbol, typically `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', or `CLIPBOARD'.
(Those are literal upper-case symbol names, since that's what X expects.)
VALUE is typically a string, or a cons of two markers, but may be
anything that the functions on `selection-converter-alist' know about.</p>
<p>
FRAME should be a frame that should own the selection.  If omitted or
nil, it defaults to the selected frame.</p>
<p>
On Nextstep, FRAME is unused.</p>
<p>
(fn SELECTION VALUE &optional FRAME)<a name="plist-member"></a>
<h3>Function: plist-member</h3>
Return non-nil if PLIST has the property PROP.
PLIST is a property list, which is a list of the form
(PROP1 VALUE1 PROP2 VALUE2 ...).  PROP is a symbol.
Unlike `plist-get', this allows you to distinguish between a missing
property and a property with the value nil.
The value is actually the tail of PLIST whose car is PROP.</p>

of the current file.<a name="gnus-set-process-query-on-exit-flag"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-set-process-query-on-exit-flag</h3>
Specify if query is needed for PROCESS when Emacs is exited.
If the second argument FLAG is non-nil, Emacs will query the user before
exiting or killing a buffer if PROCESS is running.  This function
returns FLAG.</p>
<p>
(fn PROCESS FLAG)<a name="text-properties-at"></a>
<h3>Function: text-properties-at</h3>
Return the list of properties of the character at POSITION in OBJECT.
If the optional second argument OBJECT is a buffer (or nil, which means
the current buffer), POSITION is a buffer position (integer or marker).
If OBJECT is a string, POSITION is a 0-based index into it.
If POSITION is at the end of OBJECT, the value is nil.</p>
<p>
(fn POSITION &optional OBJECT)<a name="current-local-map"></a>
<h3>Function: current-local-map</h3>
Return current buffer's local keymap, or nil if it has none.
Normally the local keymap is set by the major mode with `use-local-map'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="vc-git-branches"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-git-branches</h3>
Return the existing branches, as a list of strings.
The car of the list is the current branch.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="mapcar*"></a>
<h3>Function: mapcar*</h3>
Apply FUNCTION to each element of SEQ, and make a list of the results.
If there are several SEQs, FUNCTION is called with that many arguments,
and mapping stops as soon as the shortest list runs out.  With just one
SEQ, this is like `mapcar'.  With several, it is like the Common Lisp
`mapcar' function extended to arbitrary sequence types.</p>

When called from Lisp, BUFFER should be the buffer to use; if
omitted, a buffer named *Custom Themes* is used.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional BUFFER)<a name="ding"></a>
<h3>Function: ding</h3>
Beep, or flash the screen.
Also, unless an argument is given,
terminate any keyboard macro currently executing.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="format-insert-annotations"></a>
<h3>Function: format-insert-annotations</h3>
Apply list of annotations to buffer as `write-region' would.
Insert each element of the given LIST of buffer annotations at its
appropriate place.  Use second arg OFFSET if the annotations' locations are
not relative to the beginning of the buffer: annotations will be inserted
at their location-OFFSET+1 (ie, the offset is treated as the position of
the first character in the buffer).<a name="locale-info"></a>
<h3>Function: locale-info</h3>
Access locale data ITEM for the current C locale, if available.
ITEM should be one of the following:</p>
<p>
`codeset', returning the character set as a string (locale item CODESET);</p>
<p>
`days', returning a 7-element vector of day names (locale items DAY_n);</p>
<p>
`months', returning a 12-element vector of month names (locale items MON_n);</p>
<p>
`paper', returning a list (WIDTH HEIGHT) for the default paper size,
  both measured in millimeters (locale items PAPER_WIDTH, PAPER_HEIGHT).</p>
<p>
If the system can't provide such information through a call to
`nl_langinfo', or if ITEM isn't from the list above, return nil.</p>
<p>
See also Info node `(libc)Locales'.</p>
<p>
The data read from the system are decoded using `locale-coding-system'.</p>
<p>
(fn ITEM)<a name="rx-check-any-string"></a>
<h3>Function: rx-check-any-string</h3>
Check string argument STR for Rx `any'.<a name="compilation-move-to-column"></a>
<h3>Function: compilation-move-to-column</h3>
Go to column COL on the current line.
If SCREEN is non-nil, columns are screen columns, otherwise, they are
just char-counts.<a name="comint-kill-region"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-kill-region</h3>
Like `kill-region', but ignores read-only properties, if safe.
This command assumes that the buffer contains read-only
"prompts" which are regions with front-sticky read-only
properties at the beginning of a line, with the preceding newline
being read-only to protect the prompt.  This is true of the
comint prompts if `comint-prompt-read-only' is non-nil.  This
command will not delete the region if this would create mutilated
or out of place prompts.  That is, if any part of a prompt is
deleted, the entire prompt must be deleted and all remaining
prompts should stay at the beginning of a line.  If this is not
the case, this command just calls `kill-region' with all
read-only properties intact.  The read-only status of newlines is
updated using `comint-update-fence', if necessary.</p>
<p>
(fn BEG END &optional YANK-HANDLER)<a name="talk"></a>
<h3>Function: talk</h3>
Connect to the Emacs talk group from the current X display or tty frame.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="multi-isearch-files-regexp"></a>
<h3>Function: multi-isearch-files-regexp</h3>
Start multi-buffer regexp Isearch on a list of FILES.
Relative file names in this list are expanded to absolute
file names using the current buffer's value of `default-directory'.
Interactively read file names to search, one by one, ended with RET.
With a prefix argument, ask for a wildcard, and search in file buffers
whose file names match the specified wildcard.<a name="find-library"></a>
<h3>Function: find-library</h3>
Find the Emacs Lisp source of LIBRARY.
LIBRARY should be a string (the name of the library).<a name="color-values"></a>
<h3>Function: color-values</h3>
Return a description of the color named COLOR on frame FRAME.
COLOR should be a string naming a color (e.g. "white"), or a
string specifying a color's RGB components (e.g. "#ff12ec").</p>
<p>
Return a list of three integers, (RED GREEN BLUE), each between 0
and either 65280 or 65535 (the maximum depends on the system).
Use `color-name-to-rgb' if you want RGB floating-point values
normalized to 1.0.</p>
<p>
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.
If FRAME cannot display COLOR, the value is nil.</p>
<p>
COLOR can also be the symbol `unspecified' or one of the strings
"unspecified-fg" or "unspecified-bg", in which case the
return value is nil.<a name="ispell-begin-skip-region-regexp"></a>
<h3>Function: ispell-begin-skip-region-regexp</h3>
Return a regexp of the search keys for region skipping.
Includes `ispell-skip-region-alist' plus tex, tib, html, and comment keys.
Must be called after `ispell-buffer-local-parsing' due to dependence on mode.<a name="mwheel-filter-click-events"></a>
<h3>Function: mwheel-filter-click-events</h3>
Discard `mouse-wheel-click-event' while scrolling the mouse.<a name="pdb"></a>

Run pdb on program FILE in buffer `*gud-FILE*'.
The directory containing FILE becomes the initial working directory
and source-file directory for your debugger.</p>
<p>
(fn COMMAND-LINE)<a name="lisp-indent-function"></a>
<h3>Function: lisp-indent-function</h3>
This function is the normal value of the variable `lisp-indent-function'.
The function `calculate-lisp-indent' calls this to determine
if the arguments of a Lisp function call should be indented specially.</p>
<p>
INDENT-POINT is the position at which the line being indented begins.
Point is located at the point to indent under (for default indentation);
STATE is the `parse-partial-sexp' state for that position.</p>
<p>
If the current line is in a call to a Lisp function that has a non-nil
property `lisp-indent-function' (or the deprecated `lisp-indent-hook'),
it specifies how to indent.  The property value can be:</p>
<p>
* `defun', meaning indent `defun'-style
  (this is also the case if there is no property and the function
  has a name that begins with "def", and three or more arguments);</p>
<p>
* an integer N, meaning indent the first N arguments specially
  (like ordinary function arguments), and then indent any further
  arguments like a body;</p>
<p>
* a function to call that returns the indentation (or nil).
  `lisp-indent-function' calls this function with the same two arguments
  that it itself received.</p>
<p>
This function returns either the indentation to use, or nil if the
Lisp function does not specify a special indentation.<a name="compilation-sentinel"></a>
<h3>Function: compilation-sentinel</h3>
Sentinel for compilation buffers.<a name="Info-virtual-fun"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-virtual-fun</h3>
Find a function that handles operations on virtual manuals.
OP is an operation symbol (`find-file', `find-node' or `toc-nodes'),
FILENAME is a virtual Info file name, NODENAME is a virtual Info
node name.  Return a function found either in `Info-virtual-files'
or `Info-virtual-nodes'.<a name="vc-retrieve-tag"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-retrieve-tag</h3>
Descending recursively from DIR, retrieve the tag called NAME.
If NAME is empty, it refers to the latest revisions.
If locking is used for the files in DIR, then there must not be any
locked files at or below DIR (but if NAME is empty, locked files are
allowed and simply skipped).</p>
<p>
(fn DIR NAME)<a name="binhex-decode-region"></a>
<h3>Function: binhex-decode-region</h3>
Binhex decode region between START and END.</p>
<p>
(fn START END)<a name="start-file-process"></a>
<h3>Function: start-file-process</h3>
Start a program in a subprocess.  Return the process object for it.</p>
<p>
Similar to `start-process', but may invoke a file handler based on
`default-directory'.  See Info node `(elisp)Magic File Names'.</p>
<p>
This handler ought to run PROGRAM, perhaps on the local host,
perhaps on a remote host that corresponds to `default-directory'.
In the latter case, the local part of `default-directory' becomes
the working directory of the process.</p>
<p>
PROGRAM and PROGRAM-ARGS might be file names.  They are not
objects of file handler invocation.  File handlers might not
support pty association, if PROGRAM is nil.<a name="seq-reverse"></a>
<h3>Function: seq-reverse</h3>
Return the reversed copy of list, vector, or string SEQUENCE.
See also the function `nreverse', which is used more often.</p>
<p>
(fn SEQUENCE)<a name="comint-delete-output"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-delete-output</h3>
Delete all output from interpreter since last input.
Does not delete the prompt.</p>
<p>

<p>
(fn)<a name="list-registers"></a>
<h3>Function: list-registers</h3>
Display a list of nonempty registers saying briefly what they contain.<a name="vc-delete-file"></a>
<h3>Function: vc-delete-file</h3>
Delete file and mark it as such in the version control system.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE)<a name="shell"></a>
<h3>Function: shell</h3>
Run an inferior shell, with I/O through BUFFER (which defaults to `*shell*').
Interactively, a prefix arg means to prompt for BUFFER.
If `default-directory' is a remote file name, it is also prompted
to change if called with a prefix arg.</p>
<p>
If BUFFER exists but shell process is not running, make new shell.
If BUFFER exists and shell process is running, just switch to BUFFER.
Program used comes from variable `explicit-shell-file-name',
 or (if that is nil) from the ESHELL environment variable,
 or (if that is nil) from `shell-file-name'.
If a file `~/.emacs_SHELLNAME' exists, or `~/.emacs.d/init_SHELLNAME.sh',
it is given as initial input (but this may be lost, due to a timing
error, if the shell discards input when it starts up).
The buffer is put in Shell mode, giving commands for sending input
and controlling the subjobs of the shell.  See `shell-mode'.
See also the variable `shell-prompt-pattern'.</p>
<p>
To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the input and output to the shell, use C-x RET c
before M-x shell.  You can also specify this with C-x RET p
in the shell buffer, after you start the shell.
The default comes from `process-coding-system-alist' and
`default-process-coding-system'.</p>
<p>
The shell file name (sans directories) is used to make a symbol name
such as `explicit-csh-args'.  If that symbol is a variable,
its value is used as a list of arguments when invoking the shell.
Otherwise, one argument `-i' is passed to the shell.</p>
<p>
(Type C-h m in the shell buffer for a list of commands.)</p>

Major mode for Ebrowse member buffers.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="set-frame-selected-window"></a>
<h3>Function: set-frame-selected-window</h3>
Set selected window of FRAME to WINDOW.
FRAME must be a live frame and defaults to the selected one.  If FRAME
is the selected frame, this makes WINDOW the selected window.  Optional
argument NORECORD non-nil means to neither change the order of recently
selected windows nor the buffer list.  WINDOW must denote a live window.
Return WINDOW.</p>
<p>
(fn FRAME WINDOW &optional NORECORD)<a name="re-search-forward"></a>
<h3>Function: re-search-forward</h3>
Search forward from point for regular expression REGEXP.
Set point to the end of the occurrence found, and return point.
An optional second argument bounds the search; it is a buffer position.
The match found must not extend after that position.
Optional third argument, if t, means if fail just return nil (no error).
  If not nil and not t, move to limit of search and return nil.
Optional fourth argument is repeat count--search for successive occurrences.</p>
<p>
Search case-sensitivity is determined by the value of the variable
`case-fold-search', which see.</p>
<p>
See also the functions `match-beginning', `match-end', `match-string',
and `replace-match'.</p>

<h3>Function: epl-package-outdated-p</h3>
Determine whether a PACKAGE is outdated.</p>
<p>
A package is outdated, if there is an available package with a
higher version.</p>
<p>
PACKAGE is either a package name as symbol, or a package object.
In the former case, test the installed or built-in package with
the highest version number, in the later case, test the package
object itself.</p>

(fn OBJECT)<a name="set-face-attribute"></a>
<h3>Function: set-face-attribute</h3>
Set attributes of FACE on FRAME from ARGS.
This function overrides the face attributes specified by FACE's
face spec.  It is mostly intended for internal use only.</p>
<p>
If FRAME is nil, set the attributes for all existing frames, as
well as the default for new frames.  If FRAME is t, change the
default for new frames only.</p>
<p>
ARGS must come in pairs ATTRIBUTE VALUE.  ATTRIBUTE must be a
valid face attribute name.  All attributes can be set to
`unspecified'; this fact is not further mentioned below.</p>
<p>
The following attributes are recognized:</p>
<p>
`:family'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a string specifying the font family
(e.g. "Monospace") or a fontset.</p>
<p>
`:foundry'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a string specifying the font foundry,
e.g. ``adobe''.  If a font foundry is specified, wild-cards `*'
and `?' are allowed.</p>
<p>
`:width'</p>
<p>
VALUE specifies the relative proportionate width of the font to use.
It must be one of the symbols `ultra-condensed', `extra-condensed',
`condensed', `semi-condensed', `normal', `semi-expanded', `expanded',
`extra-expanded', or `ultra-expanded'.</p>
<p>
`:height'</p>
<p>
VALUE specifies the relative or absolute height of the font.  An
absolute height is an integer, and specifies font height in units
of 1/10 pt.  A relative height is either a floating point number,
which specifies a scaling factor for the underlying face height;
or a function that takes a single argument (the underlying face
height) and returns the new height.  Note that for the `default'
face, you must specify an absolute height (since there is nothing
for it to be relative to).</p>
<p>
`:weight'</p>
<p>
VALUE specifies the weight of the font to use.  It must be one of the
symbols `ultra-bold', `extra-bold', `bold', `semi-bold', `normal',
`semi-light', `light', `extra-light', `ultra-light'.</p>
<p>
`:slant'</p>
<p>
VALUE specifies the slant of the font to use.  It must be one of the
symbols `italic', `oblique', `normal', `reverse-italic', or
`reverse-oblique'.</p>
<p>
`:foreground', `:background'</p>
<p>
VALUE must be a color name, a string.</p>
<p>
`:underline'</p>
<p>
VALUE specifies whether characters in FACE should be underlined.
If VALUE is t, underline with foreground color of the face.
If VALUE is a string, underline with that color.
If VALUE is nil, explicitly don't underline.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, VALUE must be a property list of the form:</p>
<p>
`(:color COLOR :style STYLE)'.</p>
<p>
COLOR can be a either a color name string or `foreground-color'.
STYLE can be either `line' or `wave'.
If a keyword/value pair is missing from the property list, a
default value will be used for the value.
The default value of COLOR is the foreground color of the face.
The default value of STYLE is `line'.</p>
<p>
`:overline'</p>
<p>
VALUE specifies whether characters in FACE should be overlined.  If
VALUE is t, overline with foreground color of the face.  If VALUE is a
string, overline with that color.  If VALUE is nil, explicitly don't
overline.</p>
<p>
`:strike-through'</p>
<p>
VALUE specifies whether characters in FACE should be drawn with a line
striking through them.  If VALUE is t, use the foreground color of the
face.  If VALUE is a string, strike-through with that color.  If VALUE
is nil, explicitly don't strike through.</p>
<p>
`:box'</p>
<p>
VALUE specifies whether characters in FACE should have a box drawn
around them.  If VALUE is nil, explicitly don't draw boxes.  If
VALUE is t, draw a box with lines of width 1 in the foreground color
of the face.  If VALUE is a string, the string must be a color name,
and the box is drawn in that color with a line width of 1.  Otherwise,
VALUE must be a property list of the form `(:line-width WIDTH
:color COLOR :style STYLE)'.  If a keyword/value pair is missing from
the property list, a default value will be used for the value, as
specified below.  WIDTH specifies the width of the lines to draw; it
defaults to 1.  If WIDTH is negative, the absolute value is the width
of the lines, and draw top/bottom lines inside the characters area,
not around it.  COLOR is the name of the color to draw in, default is
the foreground color of the face for simple boxes, and the background
color of the face for 3D boxes.  STYLE specifies whether a 3D box
should be draw.  If STYLE is `released-button', draw a box looking
like a released 3D button.  If STYLE is `pressed-button' draw a box
that appears like a pressed button.  If STYLE is nil, the default if
the property list doesn't contain a style specification, draw a 2D
box.</p>
<p>
`:inverse-video'</p>
<p>
VALUE specifies whether characters in FACE should be displayed in
inverse video.  VALUE must be one of t or nil.</p>
<p>
`:stipple'</p>
<p>
If VALUE is a string, it must be the name of a file of pixmap data.
The directories listed in the `x-bitmap-file-path' variable are
searched.  Alternatively, VALUE may be a list of the form (WIDTH
HEIGHT DATA) where WIDTH and HEIGHT are the size in pixels, and DATA
is a string containing the raw bits of the bitmap.  VALUE nil means
explicitly don't use a stipple pattern.</p>
<p>
For convenience, attributes `:family', `:foundry', `:width',
`:height', `:weight', and `:slant' may also be set in one step
from an X font name:</p>
<p>
`:font'</p>
<p>
Set font-related face attributes from VALUE.  VALUE must be a
valid font name or font object.  Setting this attribute will also
set the `:family', `:foundry', `:width', `:height', `:weight',
and `:slant' attributes.</p>
<p>
`:inherit'</p>
<p>
VALUE is the name of a face from which to inherit attributes, or
a list of face names.  Attributes from inherited faces are merged
into the face like an underlying face would be, with higher
priority than underlying faces.</p>
<p>
For backward compatibility, the keywords `:bold' and `:italic'
can be used to specify weight and slant respectively.  This usage
is considered obsolete.  For these two keywords, the VALUE must
be either t or nil.  A value of t for `:bold' is equivalent to
setting `:weight' to `bold', and a value of t for `:italic' is
equivalent to setting `:slant' to `italic'.  But if `:weight' is
specified in the face spec, `:bold' is ignored, and if `:slant'
is specified, `:italic' is ignored.<a name="make-translation-table-from-vector"></a>
<h3>Function: make-translation-table-from-vector</h3>
Make translation table from decoding vector VEC.
VEC is an array of 256 elements to map unibyte codes to multibyte
characters.  Elements may be nil for undefined code points.<a name="font-get"></a>
<h3>Function: font-get</h3>
Return the value of FONT's property KEY.
FONT is a font-spec, a font-entity, or a font-object.
KEY is any symbol, but these are reserved for specific meanings:
  :family, :weight, :slant, :width, :foundry, :adstyle, :registry,
  :size, :name, :script, :otf
See the documentation of `font-spec' for their meanings.
In addition, if FONT is a font-entity or a font-object, values of
:script and :otf are different from those of a font-spec as below:</p>
<p>
The value of :script may be a list of scripts that are supported by the font.</p>
<p>
The value of :otf is a cons (GSUB . GPOS) where GSUB and GPOS are lists
representing the OpenType features supported by the font by this form:
  ((SCRIPT (LANGSYS FEATURE ...) ...) ...)
SCRIPT, LANGSYS, and FEATURE are all symbols representing OpenType
Layout tags.</p>

<h3>Function: button-activate</h3>
Call BUTTON's action property.
If USE-MOUSE-ACTION is non-nil, invoke the button's mouse-action
instead of its normal action; if the button has no mouse-action,
the normal action is used instead.<a name="flycheck-error-list-recenter-at"></a>

Recenter the error list at POS.<a name="ert-run-or-rerun-test"></a>
<h3>Function: ert-run-or-rerun-test</h3>
Run the single test TEST and record the result using STATS and LISTENER.<a name="dired-downcase"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-downcase</h3>
Rename all marked (or next ARG) files to lower case.<a name="completion-table-with-terminator"></a>
<h3>Function: completion-table-with-terminator</h3>
Construct a completion table like TABLE but with an extra TERMINATOR.
This is meant to be called in a curried way by first passing TERMINATOR
and TABLE only (via `apply-partially').
TABLE is a completion table, and TERMINATOR is a string appended to TABLE's
completion if it is complete.  TERMINATOR is also used to determine the
completion suffix's boundary.
TERMINATOR can also be a cons cell (TERMINATOR . TERMINATOR-REGEXP)
in which case TERMINATOR-REGEXP is a regular expression whose submatch
number 1 should match TERMINATOR.  This is used when there is a need to
distinguish occurrences of the TERMINATOR strings which are really terminators
from others (e.g. escaped).  In this form, the car of TERMINATOR can also be,
instead of a string, a function that takes the completion and returns the
"terminated" string.</p>
<p>
(fn TERMINATOR TABLE STRING PRED ACTION)<a name="html2text"></a>
<h3>Function: html2text</h3>
Convert HTML to plain text in the current buffer.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="insert-image"></a>
<h3>Function: insert-image</h3>
Insert IMAGE into current buffer at point.
IMAGE is displayed by inserting STRING into the current buffer
with a `display' property whose value is the image.  STRING
defaults to a single space if you omit it.
AREA is where to display the image.  AREA nil or omitted means
display it in the text area, a value of `left-margin' means
display it in the left marginal area, a value of `right-margin'
means display it in the right marginal area.
SLICE specifies slice of IMAGE to insert.  SLICE nil or omitted
means insert whole image.  SLICE is a list (X Y WIDTH HEIGHT)
specifying the X and Y positions and WIDTH and HEIGHT of image area
to insert.  A float value 0.0 - 1.0 means relative to the width or
height of the image; integer values are taken as pixel values.<a name="x-handle-reverse-video"></a>
<h3>Function: x-handle-reverse-video</h3>
Handle the reverse-video frame parameter and X resource.
`x-create-frame' does not handle this one.<a name="flycheck--checker-property-name"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck--checker-property-name</h3>
Return the SYMBOL property for checker PROPERTY.<a name="-cons-pair?"></a>
<h3>Function: -cons-pair?</h3>
Return non-nil if CON is true cons pair.
That is (A . B) where B is not a list.</p>
<p>
(fn CON)<a name="dired-sort-toggle-or-edit"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-sort-toggle-or-edit</h3>
Toggle sorting by date, and refresh the Dired buffer.
With a prefix argument, edit the current listing switches instead.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="package-handle-response"></a>
<h3>Function: package-handle-response</h3>
Handle the response from a `url-retrieve-synchronously' call.
Parse the HTTP response and throw if an error occurred.
The url package seems to require extra processing for this.
This should be called in a `save-excursion', in the download buffer.
It will move point to somewhere in the headers.<a name="shell-command"></a>
<h3>Function: shell-command</h3>
Execute string COMMAND in inferior shell; display output, if any.
With prefix argument, insert the COMMAND's output at point.</p>
<p>
If COMMAND ends in `&', execute it asynchronously.
The output appears in the buffer `*Async Shell Command*'.
That buffer is in shell mode.  You can also use
`async-shell-command' that automatically adds `&'.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, COMMAND is executed synchronously.  The output appears in
the buffer `*Shell Command Output*'.  If the output is short enough to
display in the echo area (which is determined by the variables
`resize-mini-windows' and `max-mini-window-height'), it is shown
there, but it is nonetheless available in buffer `*Shell Command
Output*' even though that buffer is not automatically displayed.</p>
<p>
To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the shell command output, use C-x RET c before this command.</p>
<p>
Noninteractive callers can specify coding systems by binding
`coding-system-for-read' and `coding-system-for-write'.</p>
<p>
The optional second argument OUTPUT-BUFFER, if non-nil,
says to put the output in some other buffer.
If OUTPUT-BUFFER is a buffer or buffer name, put the output there.
If OUTPUT-BUFFER is not a buffer and not nil,
insert output in current buffer.  (This cannot be done asynchronously.)
In either case, the buffer is first erased, and the output is
inserted after point (leaving mark after it).</p>
<p>
If the command terminates without error, but generates output,
and you did not specify "insert it in the current buffer",
the output can be displayed in the echo area or in its buffer.
If the output is short enough to display in the echo area
(determined by the variable `max-mini-window-height' if
`resize-mini-windows' is non-nil), it is shown there.
Otherwise,the buffer containing the output is displayed.</p>
<p>
If there is output and an error, and you did not specify "insert it
in the current buffer", a message about the error goes at the end
of the output.</p>
<p>
If there is no output, or if output is inserted in the current buffer,
then `*Shell Command Output*' is deleted.</p>
<p>
If the optional third argument ERROR-BUFFER is non-nil, it is a buffer
or buffer name to which to direct the command's standard error output.
If it is nil, error output is mingled with regular output.
In an interactive call, the variable `shell-command-default-error-buffer'
specifies the value of ERROR-BUFFER.</p>
<p>
In Elisp, you will often be better served by calling `call-process' or
`start-process' directly, since it offers more control and does not impose
the use of a shell (with its need to quote arguments).<a name="gnutls-get-initstage"></a>
<h3>Function: gnutls-get-initstage</h3>
Return the GnuTLS init stage of process PROC.
See also `gnutls-boot'.</p>

<h3>Function: package-read-all-archive-contents</h3>
Re-read `archive-contents', if it exists.
If successful, set `package-archive-contents'.<a name="truncate*"></a>
<h3>Function: truncate*</h3>
Return a list of the integer part of X and the fractional part of X.
With two arguments, return truncation and remainder of their quotient.</p>
<p>
(fn X &optional Y)<a name="cl-floatp-safe"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-floatp-safe</h3>
Return t if OBJECT is a floating point number.
On Emacs versions that lack floating-point support, this function
always returns nil.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT)<a name="cl-values"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-values</h3>
Return multiple values, Common Lisp style.
The arguments of `cl-values' are the values
that the containing function should return.</p>
<p>
(fn &rest VALUES)<a name="make-auto-save-file-name"></a>
<h3>Function: make-auto-save-file-name</h3>
Return file name to use for auto-saves of current buffer.
Does not consider `auto-save-visited-file-name' as that variable is checked
before calling this function.  You can redefine this for customization.
See also `auto-save-file-name-p'.<a name="display-buffer-in-atom-window"></a>
<h3>Function: display-buffer-in-atom-window</h3>
Display BUFFER in an atomic window.
This function displays BUFFER in a new window that will be
combined with an existing window to form an atomic window.  If
the existing window is already part of an atomic window, add the
new window to that atomic window.  Operations like `split-window'
or `delete-window', when applied to a constituent of an atomic
window, are applied atomically to the root of that atomic window.</p>
<p>
ALIST is an association list of symbols and values.  The
following symbols can be used.</p>
<p>
`window' specifies the existing window the new window shall be
  combined with.  Use `window-atom-root' to make the new window a
  sibling of an atomic window's root.  If an internal window is
  specified here, all children of that window become part of the
  atomic window too.  If no window is specified, the new window
  becomes a sibling of the selected window.</p>
<p>
`side' denotes the side of the existing window where the new
  window shall be located.  Valid values are `below', `right',
  `above' and `left'.  The default is `below'.</p>
<p>
The return value is the new window, nil when creating that window
failed.<a name="mail"></a>
<h3>Function: mail</h3>
Edit a message to be sent.  Prefix arg means resume editing (don't erase).
When this function returns, the buffer `*mail*' is selected.
The value is t if the message was newly initialized; otherwise, nil.</p>
<p>
Optionally, the signature file `mail-signature-file' can be inserted at the
end; see the variable `mail-signature'.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `mail-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
While editing message, type M-x mail-send-and-exit to send the message and exit.</p>
<p>
Various special commands starting with C-c are available in sendmail mode
to move to message header fields:</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `mail-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

If `mail-self-blind' is non-nil, a BCC to yourself is inserted
when the message is initialized.</p>
<p>
If `mail-default-reply-to' is non-nil, it should be an address (a string);
a Reply-to: field with that address is inserted.</p>
<p>
If `mail-archive-file-name' is non-nil, an FCC field with that file name
is inserted.</p>
<p>
The normal hook `mail-setup-hook' is run after the message is
initialized.  It can add more default fields to the message.</p>
<p>
The first argument, NOERASE, determines what to do when there is
an existing modified `*mail*' buffer.  If NOERASE is nil, the
existing mail buffer is used, and the user is prompted whether to
keep the old contents or to erase them.  If NOERASE has the value
`new', a new mail buffer will be created instead of using the old
one.  Any other non-nil value means to always select the old
buffer without erasing the contents.</p>
<p>
The second through fifth arguments,
 TO, SUBJECT, IN-REPLY-TO and CC, specify if non-nil
 the initial contents of those header fields.
 These arguments should not have final newlines.
The sixth argument REPLYBUFFER is a buffer which contains an
 original message being replied to, or else an action
 of the form (FUNCTION . ARGS) which says how to insert the original.
 Or it can be nil, if not replying to anything.
The seventh argument ACTIONS is a list of actions to take
 if/when the message is sent.  Each action looks like (FUNCTION . ARGS);
 when the message is sent, we apply FUNCTION to ARGS.
 This is how Rmail arranges to mark messages `answered'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional NOERASE TO SUBJECT IN-REPLY-TO CC REPLYBUFFER ACTIONS RETURN-ACTION)<a name="jump-to-register"></a>
<h3>Function: jump-to-register</h3>
Move point to location stored in a register.
If the register contains a file name, find that file.
(To put a file name in a register, you must use `set-register'.)
If the register contains a window configuration (one frame) or a frame
configuration (all frames), restore that frame or all frames accordingly.
First argument is a character, naming the register.
Optional second arg non-nil (interactively, prefix argument) says to
delete any existing frames that the frame configuration doesn't mention.
(Otherwise, these frames are iconified.)<a name="next-read-file-uses-dialog-p"></a>
<h3>Function: next-read-file-uses-dialog-p</h3>
Return t if a call to `read-file-name' will use a dialog.
The return value is only relevant for a call to `read-file-name' that happens
before any other event (mouse or keypress) is handled.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="move-file-to-trash"></a>
<h3>Function: move-file-to-trash</h3>
Move the file (or directory) named FILENAME to the trash.
When `delete-by-moving-to-trash' is non-nil, this function is
called by `delete-file' and `delete-directory' instead of
deleting files outright.</p>
<p>
If the function `system-move-file-to-trash' is defined, call it
 with FILENAME as an argument.
Otherwise, if `trash-directory' is non-nil, move FILENAME to that
 directory.
Otherwise, trash FILENAME using the freedesktop.org conventions,
 like the GNOME, KDE and XFCE desktop environments.  Emacs only
 moves files to "home trash", ignoring per-volume trashcans.<a name="disassemble-offset"></a>
<h3>Function: disassemble-offset</h3>

<h3>Function: file-chase-links</h3>
Chase links in FILENAME until a name that is not a link.
Unlike `file-truename', this does not check whether a parent
directory name is a symbolic link.
If the optional argument LIMIT is a number,
it means chase no more than that many links and then stop.<a name="copy-overlay"></a>
<h3>Function: copy-overlay</h3>
Return a copy of overlay O.<a name="ispell-find-aspell-dictionaries"></a>
<h3>Function: ispell-find-aspell-dictionaries</h3>

<h3>Function: pcomplete-stub</h3>
Dynamically complete STUB from CANDIDATES list.
This function inserts completion characters at point by completing
STUB from the strings in CANDIDATES.  A completions listing may be
shown in a help buffer if completion is ambiguous.</p>
<p>
Returns nil if no completion was inserted.
Returns `sole' if completed with the only completion match.
Returns `shortest' if completed with the shortest of the matches.
Returns `partial' if completed as far as possible with the matches.
Returns `listed' if a completion listing was shown.</p>
<p>
See also `pcomplete-filename'.</p>

header line with the old Message-ID.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="gnus-x-face-from-file"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-x-face-from-file</h3>
Insert an X-Face header based on an image file.</p>
<p>
Depending on `gnus-convert-image-to-x-face-command' it may accept
different input formats.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE)<a name="insert"></a>
<h3>Function: insert</h3>
Insert the arguments, either strings or characters, at point.
Point and before-insertion markers move forward to end up
 after the inserted text.
Any other markers at the point of insertion remain before the text.</p>
<p>
If the current buffer is multibyte, unibyte strings are converted
to multibyte for insertion (see `string-make-multibyte').
If the current buffer is unibyte, multibyte strings are converted
to unibyte for insertion (see `string-make-unibyte').</p>
<p>
When operating on binary data, it may be necessary to preserve the
original bytes of a unibyte string when inserting it into a multibyte
buffer; to accomplish this, apply `string-as-multibyte' to the string
and insert the result.</p>
<p>
(fn &rest ARGS)<a name="-union"></a>
<h3>Function: -union</h3>
Return a new list containing the elements of LIST and elements of LIST2 that are not in LIST.

(fn LIST LIST2)<a name="Info-virtual-file-p"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-virtual-file-p</h3>
Check if Info file FILENAME is virtual.<a name="comint-bol-or-process-mark"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-bol-or-process-mark</h3>
Move point to beginning of line (after prompt) or to the process mark.
The first time you use this command, it moves to the beginning of the line
(but after the prompt, if any).  If you repeat it again immediately,
it moves point to the process mark.</p>
<p>
The process mark separates the process output, along with input already sent,
from input that has not yet been sent.  Ordinarily, the process mark
is at the beginning of the current input line; but if you have
used M-x comint-accumulate to send multiple lines at once,
the process mark is at the beginning of the accumulated input.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="Buffer-menu-delete"></a>
<h3>Function: Buffer-menu-delete</h3>
Mark the buffer on this Buffer Menu buffer line for deletion.
A subsequent `x' command
will delete it.</p>

(fn LIST1 LIST2 [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="info-lookup-symbol"></a>
<h3>Function: info-lookup-symbol</h3>
Display the definition of SYMBOL, as found in the relevant manual.
When this command is called interactively, it reads SYMBOL from the
minibuffer.  In the minibuffer, use M-n to yank the default argument
value into the minibuffer so you can edit it.  The default symbol is the
one found at point.</p>
<p>
With prefix arg a query for the symbol help mode is offered.</p>
<p>
(fn SYMBOL &optional MODE)<a name="lisp-eval-defun"></a>
<h3>Function: lisp-eval-defun</h3>
Send the current defun to the Lisp process made by M-x run-lisp.<a name="metamail-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: metamail-buffer</h3>
Process current buffer through `metamail'.
Optional argument VIEWMODE specifies the value of the
EMACS_VIEW_MODE environment variable (defaulted to 1).
Optional argument BUFFER specifies a buffer to be filled (nil
means current).
Optional argument NODISPLAY non-nil means buffer is not
redisplayed as output is inserted.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional VIEWMODE BUFFER NODISPLAY)<a name="feedmail-run-the-queue-no-prompts"></a>
<h3>Function: feedmail-run-the-queue-no-prompts</h3>
Like `feedmail-run-the-queue', but suppress confirmation prompts.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="erc-truncate-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: erc-truncate-buffer</h3>
Truncates the current buffer to `erc-max-buffer-size'.
Meant to be used in hooks, like `erc-insert-post-hook'.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="next-line"></a>
<h3>Function: next-line</h3>
Move cursor vertically down ARG lines.
Interactively, vscroll tall lines if `auto-window-vscroll' is enabled.
If there is no character in the target line exactly under the current column,
the cursor is positioned after the character in that line which spans this
column, or at the end of the line if it is not long enough.
If there is no line in the buffer after this one, behavior depends on the
value of `next-line-add-newlines'.  If non-nil, it inserts a newline character
to create a line, and moves the cursor to that line.  Otherwise it moves the
cursor to the end of the buffer.</p>
<p>
If the variable `line-move-visual' is non-nil, this command moves
by display lines.  Otherwise, it moves by buffer lines, without
taking variable-width characters or continued lines into account.</p>
<p>
The command C-x C-n can be used to create
a semipermanent goal column for this command.
Then instead of trying to move exactly vertically (or as close as possible),
this command moves to the specified goal column (or as close as possible).
The goal column is stored in the variable `goal-column', which is nil
when there is no goal column.  Note that setting `goal-column'
overrides `line-move-visual' and causes this command to move by buffer
lines rather than by display lines.</p>
<p>
If you are thinking of using this in a Lisp program, consider
using `forward-line' instead.  It is usually easier to use
and more reliable (no dependence on goal column, etc.).<a name="windowp"></a>

<h3>Function: derived-mode-map-name</h3>
Construct a map name based on a MODE name.<a name="pr-ps-buffer-print"></a>
<h3>Function: pr-ps-buffer-print</h3>
Print buffer using PostScript printer.</p>
<p>
Interactively, the command prompts for N-UP printing number and, when you use a
prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the user for a file name, and saves
the PostScript image in that file instead of sending it to the printer.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, if N-UP is nil, prompts for N-UP printing number.  The
argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it's nil, send the image to the
printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save the PostScript image in a file with
that name.  If FILENAME is t, prompts for a file name.</p>

<p>
Finds the source file containing the definition of the function
near point (selected by `function-called-at-point') in a buffer and
places point before the definition.
Set mark before moving, if the buffer already existed.</p>
<p>
The library where FUNCTION is defined is searched for in
`find-function-source-path', if non-nil, otherwise in `load-path'.
See also `find-function-recenter-line' and `find-function-after-hook'.<a name="read-only-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: read-only-mode</h3>
Change whether the current buffer is read-only.
With prefix argument ARG, make the buffer read-only if ARG is
positive, otherwise make it writable.  If buffer is read-only
and `view-read-only' is non-nil, enter view mode.</p>
<p>
Do not call this from a Lisp program unless you really intend to
do the same thing as the C-x C-q command, including
possibly enabling or disabling View mode.  Also, note that this
command works by setting the variable `buffer-read-only', which
does not affect read-only regions caused by text properties.  To
ignore read-only status in a Lisp program (whether due to text
properties or buffer state), bind `inhibit-read-only' temporarily
to a non-nil value.<a name="rfc2047-qp-or-base64"></a>
<h3>Function: rfc2047-qp-or-base64</h3>
Return the type with which to encode the buffer.
This is either `base64' or `quoted-printable'.<a name="Info-revert-find-node"></a>

<h3>Function: pr-ps-buffer-ps-print</h3>
Print buffer using PostScript printer or through ghostscript.</p>
<p>
It depends on `pr-print-using-ghostscript'.</p>
<p>
Interactively, the command prompts for N-UP printing number and, when you use a
prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the user for a file name, and saves
the PostScript image in that file instead of sending it to the printer.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, if N-UP is nil, prompts for N-UP printing number.  The
argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it's nil, send the image to the
printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save the PostScript image in a file with
that name.  If FILENAME is t, prompts for a file name.</p>

When called interactively, read an Emacs Lisp expression and
evaluate it.
Value is also consed on to front of the variable `values'.
Optional argument EVAL-EXPRESSION-INSERT-VALUE non-nil (interactively,
with prefix argument) means insert the result into the current buffer
instead of printing it in the echo area.  Truncates long output
according to the value of the variables `eval-expression-print-length'
and `eval-expression-print-level'.</p>
<p>
If `eval-expression-debug-on-error' is non-nil, which is the default,
this command arranges for all errors to enter the debugger.<a name="pkg-info-library-version"></a>
<h3>Function: pkg-info-library-version</h3>

<p>
If the variable `line-move-visual' is non-nil, this command moves
by display lines.  Otherwise, it moves by buffer lines, without
taking variable-width characters or continued lines into account.</p>
<p>
The command C-x C-n can be used to create
a semipermanent goal column for this command.
Then instead of trying to move exactly vertically (or as close as possible),
this command moves to the specified goal column (or as close as possible).
The goal column is stored in the variable `goal-column', which is nil
when there is no goal column.  Note that setting `goal-column'
overrides `line-move-visual' and causes this command to move by buffer
lines rather than by display lines.</p>
<p>
If you are thinking of using this in a Lisp program, consider using
`forward-line' with a negative argument instead.  It is usually easier
to use and more reliable (no dependence on goal column, etc.).<a name="flycheck-handle-save"></a>

Return a list of other buffers to search for a possible abbrev.
The current buffer is not included in the list.</p>
<p>
This function makes a list of all the buffers returned by `buffer-list',
then discards buffers whose names match `dabbrev-ignored-buffer-names'
or `dabbrev-ignored-buffer-regexps'.  It also discards buffers for which
`dabbrev-friend-buffer-function', if it is bound, returns nil when called
with the buffer as argument.

<h3>Function: repeat</h3>
Repeat most recently executed command.
If REPEAT-ARG is non-nil (interactively, with a prefix argument),
supply a prefix argument to that command.  Otherwise, give the
command the same prefix argument it was given before, if any.</p>
<p>
If this command is invoked by a multi-character key sequence, it
can then be repeated by repeating the final character of that
sequence.  This behavior can be modified by the global variable
`repeat-on-final-keystroke'.</p>
<p>
`repeat' ignores commands bound to input events.  Hence the term
"most recently executed command" shall be read as "most

Splitting on regexp PAT, turn string STR into a list of substrings.
Optional third arg LIMIT (>= 1) is a limit to the length of the
resulting list.
Thus, if SEP is a regexp that only matches itself,</p>
<p>
   (mapconcat 'identity (dired-split SEP STRING) SEP)</p>
<p>
is always equal to STRING.<a name="position-if-not"></a>
<h3>Function: position-if-not</h3>
Find the first item not satisfying PREDICATE in SEQ.
Return the index of the matching item, or nil if not found.</p>
<p>
Keywords supported:  :key :start :end :from-end</p>
<p>
(fn PREDICATE SEQ [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="cl-nsubst-if"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-nsubst-if</h3>
Substitute NEW for elements matching PREDICATE in TREE (destructively).
Any element of TREE which matches is changed to NEW (via a call to `setcar').</p>
<p>
Keywords supported:  :key</p>
<p>
(fn NEW PREDICATE TREE [KEYWORD VALUE]...)<a name="insert-abbrevs"></a>
<h3>Function: insert-abbrevs</h3>
Insert after point a description of all defined abbrevs.
Mark is set after the inserted text.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="epa-delete-keys"></a>
<h3>Function: epa-delete-keys</h3>
Delete selected KEYS.</p>
<p>
(fn KEYS &optional ALLOW-SECRET)<a name="customize-face-other-window"></a>
<h3>Function: customize-face-other-window</h3>
Show customization buffer for face FACE in other window.
If FACE is actually a face-alias, customize the face it is aliased to.</p>
<p>
Interactively, when point is on text which has a face specified,
suggest to customize that face, if it's customizable.<a name="customize-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: customize-mode</h3>
Customize options related to the current major mode.
If a prefix C-u was given (or if the current major mode has no known group),
then prompt for the MODE to customize.<a name="lisp-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: lisp-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing Lisp code for Lisps other than GNU Emacs Lisp.
Commands:
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.
Blank lines separate paragraphs.  Semicolons start comments.</p>
<p>

<p>

Note that `run-lisp' may be used either to start an inferior Lisp job
or to switch back to an existing one.</p>
<p>
Entry to this mode calls the value of `lisp-mode-hook'
if that value is non-nil.<a name="locate-user-emacs-file"></a>
<h3>Function: locate-user-emacs-file</h3>
Return an absolute per-user Emacs-specific file name.
If OLD-NAME is non-nil and ~/OLD-NAME exists, return ~/OLD-NAME.
Else return NEW-NAME in `user-emacs-directory', creating the
directory if it does not exist.<a name="sit-for"></a>
<h3>Function: sit-for</h3>
Perform redisplay, then wait for SECONDS seconds or until input is available.
SECONDS may be a floating-point value.
(On operating systems that do not support waiting for fractions of a
second, floating-point values are rounded down to the nearest integer.)</p>
<p>
If optional arg NODISP is t, don't redisplay, just wait for input.
Redisplay does not happen if input is available before it starts.</p>
<p>
Value is t if waited the full time with no input arriving, and nil otherwise.</p>
<p>
An obsolete, but still supported form is
(sit-for SECONDS &optional MILLISECONDS NODISP)
where the optional arg MILLISECONDS specifies an additional wait period,
in milliseconds; this was useful when Emacs was built without
floating point support.<a name="point-at-eol"></a>
<h3>Function: point-at-eol</h3>
Return the character position of the last character on the current line.
With argument N not nil or 1, move forward N - 1 lines first.
If scan reaches end of buffer, return that position.</p>
<p>
This function ignores text display directionality; it returns the
position of the last character in logical order, i.e. the largest
character position on the line.</p>
<p>
This function constrains the returned position to the current field
unless that would be on a different line than the original,
unconstrained result.  If N is nil or 1, and a rear-sticky field ends
at point, the scan stops as soon as it starts.  To ignore field
boundaries bind `inhibit-field-text-motion' to t.</p>
<p>
This function does not move point.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional N)<a name="window-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: window-frame</h3>
Return the frame that window WINDOW is on.
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
(fn WINDOW)<a name="mouse-set-font"></a>
<h3>Function: mouse-set-font</h3>
Set the default font for the selected frame.
The argument FONTS is a list of font names; the first valid font
in this list is used.</p>
<p>
When called interactively, pop up a menu and allow the user to
choose a font.</p>
<p>
(fn &rest FONTS)<a name="rmail-input"></a>
<h3>Function: rmail-input</h3>
Run Rmail on file FILENAME.</p>
<p>
(fn FILENAME)<a name="window-minibuffer-p"></a>
<h3>Function: window-minibuffer-p</h3>
Return non-nil if WINDOW is a minibuffer window.
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional WINDOW)<a name="comint-delim-arg"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-delim-arg</h3>
Return a list of arguments from ARG.
Break it up at the delimiters in `comint-delimiter-argument-list'.
Returned list is backwards.</p>
<p>
Characters with non-nil values of the text property `literal' are
assumed to have literal values (e.g., backslash-escaped
characters), and are not considered to be delimiters.</p>
<p>
(fn ARG)<a name="dnd-handle-one-url"></a>
<h3>Function: dnd-handle-one-url</h3>
Handle one dropped url by calling the appropriate handler.
The handler is first located by looking at `dnd-protocol-alist'.
If no match is found here, and the value of `browse-url-browser-function'
is a pair of (REGEXP . FUNCTION), those regexps are tried for a match.
If no match is found, just call `dnd-insert-text'.
WINDOW is where the drop happened, ACTION is the action for the drop,
URL is what has been dropped.
Returns ACTION.<a name="eval-defun"></a>
<h3>Function: eval-defun</h3>
Evaluate the top-level form containing point, or after point.</p>
<p>
If the current defun is actually a call to `defvar' or `defcustom',
evaluating it this way resets the variable using its initial value
expression even if the variable already has some other value.
(Normally `defvar' and `defcustom' do not alter the value if there
already is one.)  In an analogous way, evaluating a `defface'
overrides any customizations of the face, so that it becomes
defined exactly as the `defface' expression says.</p>
<p>
If `eval-expression-debug-on-error' is non-nil, which is the default,
this command arranges for all errors to enter the debugger.</p>
<p>
With a prefix argument, instrument the code for Edebug.</p>
<p>
If acting on a `defun' for FUNCTION, and the function was
instrumented, `Edebug: FUNCTION' is printed in the minibuffer.  If not
instrumented, just FUNCTION is printed.</p>
<p>
If not acting on a `defun', the result of evaluation is displayed in
the minibuffer.  This display is controlled by the variables
`eval-expression-print-length' and `eval-expression-print-level',
which see.<a name="modify-frame-parameters"></a>
<h3>Function: modify-frame-parameters</h3>
Modify the parameters of frame FRAME according to ALIST.
If FRAME is nil, it defaults to the selected frame.
ALIST is an alist of parameters to change and their new values.
Each element of ALIST has the form (PARM . VALUE), where PARM is a symbol.
The meaningful PARMs depend on the kind of frame.
Undefined PARMs are ignored, but stored in the frame's parameter list
so that `frame-parameters' will return them.</p>
<p>
The value of frame parameter FOO can also be accessed
as a frame-local binding for the variable FOO, if you have
enabled such bindings for that variable with `make-variable-frame-local'.
Note that this functionality is obsolete as of Emacs 22.2, and its
use is not recommended.  Explicitly check for a frame-parameter instead.</p>
<p>
(fn FRAME ALIST)<a name="flycheck-locate-sphinx-source-directory"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-locate-sphinx-source-directory</h3>
Locate the Sphinx source directory for the current buffer.</p>
<p>
Return the source directory, or nil, if the current buffer is not
part of a Sphinx project.<a name="flycheck-must-defer-check"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-must-defer-check</h3>
Determine whether the syntax check has to be deferred.</p>
<p>
A check has to be deferred if the buffer is not visible, or if the buffer is
currently being reverted.</p>
<p>
Return t if the check is to be deferred, or nil otherwise.<a name="set-frame-font"></a>
<h3>Function: set-frame-font</h3>
Set the default font to FONT.
When called interactively, prompt for the name of a font, and use
that font on the selected frame.  When called from Lisp, FONT
should be a font name (a string), a font object, font entity, or
font spec.</p>
<p>
If KEEP-SIZE is nil, keep the number of frame lines and columns
fixed.  If KEEP-SIZE is non-nil (or with a prefix argument), try
to keep the current frame size fixed (in pixels) by adjusting the
number of lines and columns.</p>
<p>
If FRAMES is nil, apply the font to the selected frame only.
If FRAMES is non-nil, it should be a list of frames to act upon,
or t meaning all graphical frames.  Also, if FRAME is non-nil,
alter the user's Customization settings as though the
font-related attributes of the `default' face had been "set in
this session", so that the font is applied to future frames.<a name="ispell-tex-arg-end"></a>
<h3>Function: ispell-tex-arg-end</h3>
Skip across ARG number of braces.<a name="vectorp"></a>
<h3>Function: vectorp</h3>
Return t if OBJECT is a vector.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT)<a name="rx-any-condense-range"></a>
<h3>Function: rx-any-condense-range</h3>
Condense by side effect ARGS as range for Rx `any'.<a name="x-decompose-font-name"></a>
<h3>Function: x-decompose-font-name</h3>
Decompose PATTERN into XLFD fields and return a vector of the fields.
The length of the vector is 12.
The FOUNDRY and FAMILY fields are concatenated and stored in the first
element of the vector.
The REGISTRY and ENCODING fields are concatenated and stored in the last
element of the vector.</p>
<p>
Return nil if PATTERN doesn't conform to XLFD.<a name="keep-lines-read-args"></a>
<h3>Function: keep-lines-read-args</h3>
Read arguments for `keep-lines' and friends.
Prompt for a regexp with PROMPT.
Value is a list, (REGEXP).<a name="isearch-complete"></a>
<h3>Function: isearch-complete</h3>
Complete the search string from the strings on the search ring.
The completed string is then editable in the minibuffer.
If there is no completion possible, say so and continue searching.<a name="next-error"></a>
<h3>Function: next-error</h3>
Visit next `next-error' message and corresponding source code.</p>
<p>
If all the error messages parsed so far have been processed already,
the message buffer is checked for new ones.</p>
<p>
A prefix ARG specifies how many error messages to move;
negative means move back to previous error messages.
Just C-u as a prefix means reparse the error message buffer
and start at the first error.</p>
<p>
The RESET argument specifies that we should restart from the beginning.</p>
<p>
C-x ` normally uses the most recently started
compilation, grep, or occur buffer.  It can also operate on any
buffer with output from the M-x compile, M-x grep commands, or,
more generally, on any buffer in Compilation mode or with
Compilation Minor mode enabled, or any buffer in which
`next-error-function' is bound to an appropriate function.
To specify use of a particular buffer for error messages, type
C-x ` in that buffer when it is the only one displayed
in the current frame.</p>
<p>
Once C-x ` has chosen the buffer for error messages, it
runs `next-error-hook' with `run-hooks', and stays with that buffer
until you use it in some other buffer which uses Compilation mode
or Compilation Minor mode.</p>
<p>
To control which errors are matched, customize the variable
`compilation-error-regexp-alist'.<a name="font-get-system-normal-font"></a>
<h3>Function: font-get-system-normal-font</h3>
Get the system default application font.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="custom-unlispify-menu-entry"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-unlispify-menu-entry</h3>
Convert SYMBOL into a menu entry.<a name="-contains?"></a>
<h3>Function: -contains?</h3>
Return non-nil if LIST contains ELEMENT.</p>
<p>
The test for equality is done with `equal', or with `-compare-fn'
if that's non-nil.</p>
<p>
Alias: `-contains-p'</p>
<p>
(fn LIST ELEMENT)<a name="-keep"></a>
<h3>Function: -keep</h3>
Return a new list of the non-nil results of applying FN to the items in LIST.</p>
<p>
If you want to select the original items satisfying a predicate use `-filter'.</p>
<p>
(fn FN LIST)<a name="lm-history-mark"></a>
<h3>Function: lm-history-mark</h3>
Return the buffer location of the `History' start marker.<a name="fortune"></a>
<h3>Function: fortune</h3>
Display a fortune cookie.
If called with a prefix asks for the FILE to choose the fortune from,
otherwise uses the value of `fortune-file'.  If you want to have fortune
choose from a set of files in a directory, call interactively with prefix
and choose the directory as the fortune-file.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FILE)<a name="browse-url-mail"></a>
<h3>Function: browse-url-mail</h3>
Open a new mail message buffer within Emacs for the RFC 2368 URL.
Default to using the mailto: URL around or before point as the
recipient's address.  Supplying a non-nil interactive prefix argument
will cause the mail to be composed in another window rather than the
current one.</p>
<p>
When called interactively, if variable `browse-url-new-window-flag' is
non-nil use `compose-mail-other-window', otherwise `compose-mail'.  A
non-nil interactive prefix argument reverses the effect of
`browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
When called non-interactively, optional second argument NEW-WINDOW is
used instead of `browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
(fn URL &optional NEW-WINDOW)<a name="Custom-goto-parent"></a>
<h3>Function: Custom-goto-parent</h3>
Go to the parent group listed at the top of this buffer.
If several parents are listed, go to the first of them.<a name="facemenu-active-faces"></a>
<h3>Function: facemenu-active-faces</h3>
Return from FACE-LIST those faces that would be used for display.
This means each face attribute is not specified in a face earlier in FACE-LIST
and such a face is therefore active when used to display text.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, use the faces in that frame; otherwise
use the selected frame.  If t, then the global, non-frame faces are used.<a name="pr-toggle-duplex"></a>
<h3>Function: pr-toggle-duplex</h3>
Toggle duplex.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="message-forward-make-body"></a>
<h3>Function: message-forward-make-body</h3></p>

(fn FORWARD-BUFFER &optional DIGEST)<a name="delete-other-windows"></a>
<h3>Function: delete-other-windows</h3>
Make WINDOW fill its frame.
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.
Return nil.</p>
<p>
If the variable `ignore-window-parameters' is non-nil or the
`delete-other-windows' parameter of WINDOW equals t, do not
process any parameters of WINDOW.  Otherwise, if the
`delete-other-windows' parameter of WINDOW specifies a function,
call that function with WINDOW as its sole argument and return
the value returned by that function.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, if WINDOW is part of an atomic window, call this
function with the root of the atomic window as its argument.  If
WINDOW is a non-side window, make WINDOW the only non-side window
on the frame.  Side windows are not deleted.  If WINDOW is a side
window signal an error.<a name="set-window-combination-limit"></a>
<h3>Function: set-window-combination-limit</h3>
Set combination limit of window WINDOW to LIMIT; return LIMIT.
If LIMIT is nil, child windows of WINDOW can be recombined with WINDOW's
siblings.  LIMIT t means that child windows of WINDOW are never
(re-)combined with WINDOW's siblings.  Other values are reserved for
future use.</p>
<p>
WINDOW must be a valid window.  Setting the combination limit is
meaningful for internal windows only.</p>
<p>
(fn WINDOW LIMIT)<a name="sgml-parse-dtd"></a>
<h3>Function: sgml-parse-dtd</h3>
Simplistic parse of the current buffer as a DTD.
Currently just returns (EMPTY-TAGS UNCLOSED-TAGS).<a name="Info-find-node-in-buffer-1"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-find-node-in-buffer-1</h3>
Find a node or anchor in the current buffer.
REGEXP is a regular expression matching nodes or references.  Its first
group should match `Node:' or `Ref:'.
CASE-FOLD t means search for a case-insensitive match.
Value is the position at which a match was found, or nil if not found.<a name="cddaar"></a>
<h3>Function: cddaar</h3>
Return the `cdr' of the `cdr' of the `car' of the `car' of X.</p>
<p>
(fn X)<a name="tramp-completion-file-name-handler"></a>

The value is a list of elements of the form (PARM . VALUE), where PARM
is a symbol.</p>
<p>
TERMINAL can be a terminal object, a frame, or nil (meaning the
selected frame's terminal).</p>
<p>
(fn &optional TERMINAL)<a name="epl-package--package-desc-p"></a>
<h3>Function: epl-package--package-desc-p</h3>
Whether the description of PACKAGE is a `package-desc'.</p>
<p>
(fn PACKAGE)<a name="cl-map-keymap"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-map-keymap</h3>
Call FUNCTION once for each event binding in KEYMAP.
FUNCTION is called with two arguments: the event that is bound, and
the definition it is bound to.  The event may be a character range.</p>
<p>
If KEYMAP has a parent, the parent's bindings are included as well.
This works recursively: if the parent has itself a parent, then the
grandparent's bindings are also included and so on.</p>
<p>
(fn FUNCTION KEYMAP)<a name="cl--function-convert"></a>
<h3>Function: cl--function-convert</h3>
Special macro-expander for special cases of (function F).
The two cases that are handled are:

Clear Flycheck state, run `flycheck-syntax-check-failed-hook' and
report an error STATUS.<a name="epl-upgrade-p"></a>
<h3>Function: epl-upgrade-p</h3></p>
<p>

(fn CL-X)<a name="mouse-secondary-save-then-kill"></a>
<h3>Function: mouse-secondary-save-then-kill</h3>
Set the secondary selection and save it to the kill ring.
The second time, kill it.  CLICK should be a mouse click event.</p>
<p>
If you have not called `mouse-start-secondary' in the clicked
buffer, activate the secondary selection and set it between point
and the click position CLICK.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, adjust the bounds of the secondary selection.
Normally, do this by moving its beginning or end, whichever is
closer, to CLICK.  But if you have selected whole words or lines,
adjust to the word or line boundary closest to CLICK instead.</p>
<p>
If this command is called a second consecutive time with the same
CLICK position, kill the secondary selection.</p>
<p>
(fn CLICK)<a name="package-install-file"></a>
<h3>Function: package-install-file</h3>
Install a package from a file.
The file can either be a tar file or an Emacs Lisp file.<a name="find-function-setup-keys"></a>

<p>
(fn)<a name="format-decode"></a>
<h3>Function: format-decode</h3>
Decode text from any known FORMAT.
FORMAT is a symbol appearing in `format-alist' or a list of such symbols,
or nil, in which case this function tries to guess the format of the data by
matching against the regular expressions in `format-alist'.  After a match is
found and the region decoded, the alist is searched again from the beginning
for another match.</p>
<p>
Second arg LENGTH is the number of characters following point to operate on.
If optional third arg VISIT-FLAG is true, set `buffer-file-format'
to the reverted list of formats used, and call any mode functions defined
for those formats.</p>
<p>
Return the new length of the decoded region.</p>
<p>
For most purposes, consider using `format-decode-region' instead.<a name="toggle-auto-composition"></a>
<h3>Function: toggle-auto-composition</h3>
Toggle Auto Composition mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Auto Composition mode if ARG
is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,
enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>

Toggle mouse support in GNU/Linux consoles (GPM Mouse mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable GPM Mouse mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
This allows the use of the mouse when operating on a GNU/Linux console,
in the same way as you can use the mouse under X11.
It relies on the `gpm' daemon being activated.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="electric-indent-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: electric-indent-mode</h3>
Toggle on-the-fly reindentation (Electric Indent mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Electric Indent mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
This is a global minor mode.  When enabled, it reindents whenever
the hook `electric-indent-functions' returns non-nil, or you
insert a character from `electric-indent-chars'.</p>

(fn &rest SPEC &key BACKEND SECRET HOST USER PORT CREATE &allow-other-keys)<a name="server-buffer-done"></a>
<h3>Function: server-buffer-done</h3>
Mark BUFFER as "done" for its client(s).
This buries the buffer, then returns a list of the form (NEXT-BUFFER KILLED).
NEXT-BUFFER is another server buffer, as a suggestion for what to select next,
or nil.  KILLED is t if we killed BUFFER (typically, because it was visiting
a temp file).
FOR-KILLING if non-nil indicates that we are called from `kill-buffer'.</p>
<p>
(fn BUFFER &optional FOR-KILLING)<a name="tabulated-list-delete-entry"></a>
<h3>Function: tabulated-list-delete-entry</h3>
Delete the Tabulated List entry at point.
Return a list (ID COLS), where ID is the ID of the deleted entry
and COLS is a vector of its column descriptors.  Move point to
the beginning of the deleted entry.  Return nil if there is no
entry at point.</p>

<p>
Applies SGR control sequences setting foreground and background colors
to STRING using text properties and returns the result.  The colors used
are given in `ansi-color-faces-vector' and `ansi-color-names-vector'.
See function `ansi-color-apply-sequence' for details.</p>
<p>
Every call to this function will set and use the buffer-local variable
`ansi-color-context' to save partial escape sequences and current ansi codes.
This information will be used for the next call to `ansi-color-apply'.
Set `ansi-color-context' to nil if you don't want this.</p>
<p>
This function can be added to `comint-preoutput-filter-functions'.<a name="justify-current-line"></a>
<h3>Function: justify-current-line</h3>
Do some kind of justification on this line.
Normally does full justification: adds spaces to the line to make it end at
the column given by `current-fill-column'.
Optional first argument HOW specifies alternate type of justification:
it can be `left', `right', `full', `center', or `none'.
If HOW is t, will justify however the `current-justification' function says to.
If HOW is nil or missing, full justification is done by default.
Second arg EOP non-nil means that this is the last line of the paragraph, so
it will not be stretched by full justification.
Third arg NOSQUEEZE non-nil means to leave interior whitespace unchanged,
otherwise it is made canonical.<a name="end-kbd-macro"></a>
<h3>Function: end-kbd-macro</h3>

<h3>Function: list-dynamic-libraries</h3>
Display a list of all dynamic libraries known to Emacs.
(These are the libraries listed in `dynamic-library-alist'.)
If optional argument LOADED-ONLY-P (interactively, prefix arg)
is non-nil, only libraries already loaded are listed.
Optional argument BUFFER specifies a buffer to use, instead of
"*Dynamic Libraries*".
The return value is always nil.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional LOADED-ONLY-P BUFFER)<a name="gud-gdb"></a>

(fn COMMAND-LINE)<a name="follow-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: follow-mode</h3>
Toggle Follow mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Follow mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Follow mode is a minor mode that combines windows into one tall
virtual window.  This is accomplished by two main techniques:</p>
<p>
* The windows always displays adjacent sections of the buffer.
  This means that whenever one window is moved, all the
  others will follow.  (Hence the name Follow mode.)</p>
<p>
* Should the point (cursor) end up outside a window, another
  window displaying that point is selected, if possible.  This
  makes it possible to walk between windows using normal cursor
  movement commands.</p>
<p>
Follow mode comes to its prime when used on a large screen and two
side-by-side windows are used.  The user can, with the help of Follow
mode, use two full-height windows as though they would have been
one.  Imagine yourself editing a large function, or section of text,
and being able to use 144 lines instead of the normal 72... (your
mileage may vary).</p>
<p>
To split one large window into two side-by-side windows, the commands
`C-x 3' or `M-x follow-delete-other-windows-and-split' can be used.</p>
<p>
Only windows displayed in the same frame follow each other.</p>
<p>
This command runs the normal hook `follow-mode-hook'.</p>
<p>
Keys specific to Follow mode:</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `follow-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>

<h3>Function: send-string</h3>
Send PROCESS the contents of STRING as input.
PROCESS may be a process, a buffer, the name of a process or buffer, or
nil, indicating the current buffer's process.
If STRING is more than 500 characters long,
it is sent in several bunches.  This may happen even for shorter strings.
Output from processes can arrive in between bunches.</p>
<p>
(fn PROCESS STRING)<a name="mail-strip-quoted-names"></a>
<h3>Function: mail-strip-quoted-names</h3>

<p>

(fn PROMPT &optional DEFAULT HISTORY)<a name="sentence-end"></a>
<h3>Function: sentence-end</h3>
Return the regexp describing the end of a sentence.</p>
<p>
This function returns either the value of the variable `sentence-end'
if it is non-nil, or the default value constructed from the
variables `sentence-end-base', `sentence-end-double-space',
`sentence-end-without-period' and `sentence-end-without-space'.</p>
<p>
The default value specifies that in order to be recognized as the
end of a sentence, the ending period, question mark, or exclamation point
must be followed by two spaces, with perhaps some closing delimiters
in between.  See Info node `(elisp)Standard Regexps'.<a name="org-insert-link-global"></a>
<h3>Function: org-insert-link-global</h3>

This command can be called in any mode to insert a link in Org-mode syntax.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="tty-color-translate"></a>
<h3>Function: tty-color-translate</h3>
Given a color COLOR, return the index of the corresponding TTY color.</p>
<p>
COLOR must be a string that is either the color's name, or its X-style
specification like "#RRGGBB" or "RGB:rr/gg/bb", where each primary.
color can be given with 1 to 4 hex digits.</p>
<p>
If COLOR is a color name that is found among supported colors in
`tty-color-alist', the associated index is returned.  Otherwise, the
RGB values of the color, either as given by the argument or from
looking up the name in `color-name-rgb-alist', are used to find the
supported color that is the best approximation for COLOR in the RGB
space.
If COLOR is neither a valid X RGB specification of the color, nor a
name of a color in `color-name-rgb-alist', the returned value is nil.</p>
<p>
If FRAME is unspecified or nil, it defaults to the selected frame.<a name="dbus-get-unique-name"></a>

them, and what functions they call.  The list includes all functions
whose definitions have been compiled in this Emacs session, as well as
all functions called by those functions.</p>
<p>
The call graph does not include macros, inline functions, or
primitives that the byte-code interpreter knows about directly (eq,
cons, etc.).</p>
<p>
The call tree also lists those functions which are not known to be called
(that is, to which no calls have been compiled), and which cannot be
invoked interactively.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FILENAME)<a name="iso-iso2tex"></a>
<h3>Function: iso-iso2tex</h3>
Translate ISO 8859-1 characters to TeX sequences.

`iso-iso2tex-trans-tab'.
Optional arg BUFFER is ignored (for use in `format-alist').</p>
<p>
(fn FROM TO &optional BUFFER)<a name="custom-make-theme-feature"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-make-theme-feature</h3>
Given a symbol THEME, create a new symbol by appending "-theme".
Store this symbol in the `theme-feature' property of THEME.
Calling `provide-theme' to provide THEME actually puts `THEME-theme'
into `features'.</p>
<p>
This allows for a file-name convention for autoloading themes:
Every theme X has a property `provide-theme' whose value is "X-theme".
(load-theme X) then attempts to load the file `X-theme.el'.<a name="mouse-drag-vertical-line"></a>
<h3>Function: mouse-drag-vertical-line</h3>

(fn START-EVENT)<a name="pr-ps-name"></a>
<h3>Function: pr-ps-name</h3>

<p>
(fn)<a name="nxml-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: nxml-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing XML.</p>
<p>
M-x nxml-finish-element finishes the current element by inserting an end-tag.
C-c C-i closes a start-tag with `>' and then inserts a balancing end-tag
leaving point between the start-tag and end-tag.
M-x nxml-balanced-close-start-tag-block is similar but for block rather than inline elements:
the start-tag, point, and end-tag are all left on separate lines.
If `nxml-slash-auto-complete-flag' is non-nil, then inserting a `</'
automatically inserts the rest of the end-tag.</p>
<p>
M-x completion-at-point performs completion on the symbol preceding point.</p>
<p>
M-x nxml-dynamic-markup-word uses the contents of the current buffer
to choose a tag to put around the word preceding point.</p>
<p>
Sections of the document can be displayed in outline form.  The
variable `nxml-section-element-name-regexp' controls when an element
is recognized as a section.  The same key sequences that change
visibility in outline mode are used except that they start with C-c C-o
instead of C-c.</p>
<p>
Validation is provided by the related minor-mode `rng-validate-mode'.
This also makes completion schema- and context- sensitive.  Element
names, attribute names, attribute values and namespace URIs can all be
completed. By default, `rng-validate-mode' is automatically enabled.
You can toggle it using M-x rng-validate-mode or change the default by
customizing `rng-nxml-auto-validate-flag'.</p>
<p>
TAB indents the current line appropriately.
This can be customized using the variable `nxml-child-indent'
and the variable `nxml-attribute-indent'.</p>
<p>
M-x nxml-insert-named-char inserts a character reference using
the character's name (by default, the Unicode name).
C-u M-x nxml-insert-named-char inserts the character directly.</p>
<p>
The Emacs commands that normally operate on balanced expressions will
operate on XML markup items.  Thus C-M-f will move forward
across one markup item; C-M-b will move backward across
one markup item; C-M-k will kill the following markup item;
C-M-@ will mark the following markup item.  By default, each
tag each treated as a single markup item; to make the complete element
be treated as a single markup item, set the variable
`nxml-sexp-element-flag' to t.  For more details, see the function
`nxml-forward-balanced-item'.</p>
<p>
M-x nxml-backward-up-element and M-x nxml-down-element move up and down the element structure.</p>
<p>
Many aspects this mode can be customized using
M-x customize-group nxml RET.</p>

<h3>Function: define-char-code-property</h3>
Define NAME as a character code property given by TABLE.
TABLE is a char-table of purpose `char-code-property-table' with
these extra slots:
  1st: NAME.
  2nd: Function to call to get a property value of a character.
    It is called with three arguments CHAR, VAL, and TABLE, where
    CHAR is a character, VAL is the value of (aref TABLE CHAR).
  3rd: Function to call to put a property value of a character.
    It is called with the same arguments as above.
  4th: Function to call to get a description string of a property value.
    It is called with one argument VALUE, a property value.
  5th: Data used by the above functions.</p>
<p>
TABLE may be a name of file to load to build a char-table.  The
file should contain a call of `define-char-code-property' with a
char-table of the above format as the argument TABLE.</p>
<p>
TABLE may also be nil, in which case no property value is pre-assigned.</p>
<p>
Optional 3rd argument DOCSTRING is a documentation string of the property.</p>

<h3>Function: file-remote-p</h3>
Test whether FILE specifies a location on a remote system.
A file is considered remote if accessing it is likely to
be slower or less reliable than accessing local files.</p>
<p>
`file-remote-p' never opens a new remote connection.  It can
only reuse a connection that is already open.</p>
<p>
Return nil or a string identifying the remote connection
(ideally a prefix of FILE).  Return nil if FILE is a relative
file name.</p>
<p>
When IDENTIFICATION is nil, the returned string is a complete
remote identifier: with components method, user, and host.  The
components are those present in FILE, with defaults filled in for
any that are missing.</p>
<p>
IDENTIFICATION can specify which part of the identification to
return.  IDENTIFICATION can be the symbol `method', `user',
`host', or `localname'.  Any other value is handled like nil and
means to return the complete identification.  The string returned
for IDENTIFICATION `localname' can differ depending on whether
there is an existing connection.</p>
<p>
If CONNECTED is non-nil, return an identification only if FILE is
located on a remote system and a connection is established to
that remote system.</p>
<p>
Tip: You can use this expansion of remote identifier components
     to derive a new remote file name from an existing one.  For
     example, if FILE is "/sudo::/path/to/file" then</p>
<p>
       (concat (file-remote-p FILE) "/bin/sh")</p>
<p>
     returns a remote file name for file "/bin/sh" that has the
     same remote identifier as FILE but expanded; a name such as
     "/sudo:root@myhost:/bin/sh".<a name="gnus-merge"></a>

<a name="font-lock-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: font-lock-mode</h3>
Toggle syntax highlighting in this buffer (Font Lock mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Font Lock mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When Font Lock mode is enabled, text is fontified as you type it:</p>
<p>
 - Comments are displayed in `font-lock-comment-face';
 - Strings are displayed in `font-lock-string-face';
 - Certain other expressions are displayed in other faces according to the
   value of the variable `font-lock-keywords'.</p>
<p>
To customize the faces (colors, fonts, etc.) used by Font Lock for
fontifying different parts of buffer text, use M-x customize-face.</p>
<p>
You can enable Font Lock mode in any major mode automatically by turning on in
the major mode's hook.  For example, put in your ~/.emacs:</p>
<p>
 (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you can use Global Font Lock mode to automagically turn on Font
Lock mode in buffers whose major mode supports it and whose major mode is one
of `font-lock-global-modes'.  For example, put in your ~/.emacs:</p>
<p>
 (global-font-lock-mode t)</p>
<p>
Where major modes support different levels of fontification, you can use
the variable `font-lock-maximum-decoration' to specify which level you
generally prefer.  When you turn Font Lock mode on/off the buffer is
fontified/defontified, though fontification occurs only if the buffer is
less than `font-lock-maximum-size'.</p>
<p>
To add your own highlighting for some major mode, and modify the highlighting
selected automatically via the variable `font-lock-maximum-decoration', you can
use `font-lock-add-keywords'.</p>
<p>
To fontify a buffer, without turning on Font Lock mode and regardless of buffer
size, you can use M-x font-lock-fontify-buffer.</p>
<p>
To fontify a block (the function or paragraph containing point, or a number of
lines around point), perhaps because modification on the current line caused
syntactic change on other lines, you can use M-o M-o.</p>
<p>
You can set your own default settings for some mode, by setting a
buffer local value for `font-lock-defaults', via its mode hook.</p>
<p>
The above is the default behavior of `font-lock-mode'; you may specify
your own function which is called when `font-lock-mode' is toggled via
`font-lock-function'. <a name="widget-radio-value-set"></a>
<h3>Function: widget-radio-value-set</h3></p>
<p>

(fn WIDGET VALUE)<a name="flycheck-checker-executable"></a>
<h3>Function: flycheck-checker-executable</h3>

`flycheck-CHECKER-executable', or the default executable given in
the syntax checker definition, if the variable is nil.<a name="rx-syntax"></a>
<h3>Function: rx-syntax</h3>
Parse and produce code from FORM, which is `(syntax SYMBOL)'.<a name="auto-lower-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: auto-lower-mode</h3>
Toggle whether or not the selected frame should auto-lower.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Auto Lower mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Auto Lower mode does nothing under most window managers, which
switch focus on mouse clicks.  It only has an effect if your
window manager switches focus on mouse movement (in which case
you should also change `focus-follows-mouse' to t).  Then,
enabling Auto Lower Mode causes any graphical Emacs frame which
loses focus to be automatically lowered.</p>
<p>
Note that this minor mode controls Emacs's own auto-lower
feature.  Window managers that switch focus on mouse movement
often have their own features for raising or lowering frames.<a name="display-multi-font-p"></a>
<h3>Function: display-multi-font-p</h3>
Return non-nil if DISPLAY is a graphic display.
Graphical displays are those which are capable of displaying several
frames and several different fonts at once.  This is true for displays
that use a window system such as X, and false for text-only terminals.
DISPLAY can be a display name, a frame, or nil (meaning the selected
frame's display).<a name="shell-completion-vars"></a>

<h3>Function: x-dnd-choose-type</h3>
Choose which type we want to receive for the drop.
TYPES are the types the source of the drop offers, a vector of type names
as strings or symbols.  Select among the types in `x-dnd-known-types' or
KNOWN-TYPES if given, and return that type name.
If no suitable type is found, return nil.<a name="run-hook-with-args-until-failure"></a>
<h3>Function: run-hook-with-args-until-failure</h3>
Run HOOK with the specified arguments ARGS.
HOOK should be a symbol, a hook variable.  The value of HOOK
may be nil, a function, or a list of functions.  Call each
function in order with arguments ARGS, stopping at the first
one that returns nil, and return nil.  Otherwise (if all functions
return non-nil, or if there are no functions to call), return non-nil
(do not rely on the precise return value in this case).</p>
<p>
Do not use `make-local-variable' to make a hook variable buffer-local.
Instead, use `add-hook' and specify t for the LOCAL argument.</p>

<h3>Function: right-char</h3>
Move point N characters to the right (to the left if N is negative).
On reaching beginning or end of buffer, stop and signal error.</p>
<p>
Depending on the bidirectional context, this may move either forward
or backward in the buffer.  This is in contrast with C-f
and C-b, which see.<a name="find-file"></a>
<h3>Function: find-file</h3>
Edit file FILENAME.
Switch to a buffer visiting file FILENAME,
creating one if none already exists.
Interactively, the default if you just type RET is the current directory,
but the visited file name is available through the minibuffer history:
type M-n to pull it into the minibuffer.</p>
<p>
You can visit files on remote machines by specifying something
like /ssh:SOME_REMOTE_MACHINE:FILE for the file name.  You can
also visit local files as a different user by specifying
/sudo::FILE for the file name.
See the Info node `(tramp)Filename Syntax' in the Tramp Info
manual, for more about this.</p>
<p>
Interactively, or if WILDCARDS is non-nil in a call from Lisp,
expand wildcards (if any) and visit multiple files.  You can
suppress wildcard expansion by setting `find-file-wildcards' to nil.</p>
<p>
To visit a file without any kind of conversion and without
automatically choosing a major mode, use M-x find-file-literally.<a name="menu-bar-showhide-tool-bar-menu-customize-enable-bottom"></a>

(fn ARG &optional END OBEG OEND)<a name="global-auto-revert-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: global-auto-revert-mode</h3>
Toggle Global Auto Revert mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Global Auto Revert mode if ARG
is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,
enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Global Auto Revert mode is a global minor mode that reverts any
buffer associated with a file when the file changes on disk.  Use
`auto-revert-mode' to revert a particular buffer.</p>
<p>
If `global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers' is non-nil, this mode
may also revert some non-file buffers, as described in the
documentation of that variable.  It ignores buffers with modes
matching `global-auto-revert-ignore-modes', and buffers with a
non-nil vale of `global-auto-revert-ignore-buffer'.</p>
<p>
This function calls the hook `global-auto-revert-mode-hook'.
It displays the text that `global-auto-revert-mode-text'
specifies in the mode line.</p>

Main entry point for closure conversion.
-- FORM is a piece of Elisp code after macroexpansion.
-- TOPLEVEL(optional) is a boolean variable, true if we are at the root of AST</p>
<p>
Returns a form where all lambdas don't have any free variables.</p>
<p>
(fn FORM)<a name="set-auto-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: set-auto-mode</h3>
Select major mode appropriate for current buffer.</p>
<p>
To find the right major mode, this function checks for a -*- mode tag
checks for a `mode:' entry in the Local Variables section of the file,
checks if it uses an interpreter listed in `interpreter-mode-alist',
matches the buffer beginning against `magic-mode-alist',
compares the filename against the entries in `auto-mode-alist',
then matches the buffer beginning against `magic-fallback-mode-alist'.</p>
<p>
If `enable-local-variables' is nil, or if the file name matches
`inhibit-local-variables-regexps', this function does not check
for any mode: tag anywhere in the file.  If `local-enable-local-variables'
is nil, then the only mode: tag that can be relevant is a -*- one.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument KEEP-MODE-IF-SAME is non-nil, then we
set the major mode only if that would change it.  In other words
we don't actually set it to the same mode the buffer already has.<a name="-pad"></a>
<h3>Function: -pad</h3>
Appends FILL-VALUE to the end of each list in LISTS such that they
will all have the same length.</p>
<p>
(fn FILL-VALUE &rest LISTS)<a name="lm-maintainer"></a>
<h3>Function: lm-maintainer</h3>
Return the maintainer of file FILE, or current buffer if FILE is nil.
The return value has the form (NAME . ADDRESS).<a name="cl-tenth"></a>
<h3>Function: cl-tenth</h3>
Return the tenth element of the list X.</p>
<p>
(fn X)<a name="face-spec-set-2"></a>
<h3>Function: face-spec-set-2</h3>
Set the face attributes of FACE on FRAME according to SPEC.<a name="safe-length"></a>
<h3>Function: safe-length</h3>
Return the length of a list, but avoid error or infinite loop.
This function never gets an error.  If LIST is not really a list,
it returns 0.  If LIST is circular, it returns a finite value
which is at least the number of distinct elements.</p>
<p>
(fn LIST)<a name="html-radio-buttons"></a>
<h3>Function: html-radio-buttons</h3>
Group of connected radio button inputs.</p>
<p>
This is a skeleton command (see `skeleton-insert').
Normally the skeleton text is inserted at point, with nothing "inside".
If there is a highlighted region, the skeleton text is wrapped
around the region text.</p>
<p>
A prefix argument ARG says to wrap the skeleton around the next ARG words.
A prefix argument of -1 says to wrap around region, even if not highlighted.
A prefix argument of zero says to wrap around zero words---that is, nothing.
This is a way of overriding the use of a highlighted region.<a name="sgml-lexical-context"></a>
<h3>Function: sgml-lexical-context</h3>
Return the lexical context at point as (TYPE . START).
START is the location of the start of the lexical element.
TYPE is one of `string', `comment', `tag', `cdata', `pi', or `text'.</p>
<p>
Optional argument LIMIT is the position to start parsing from.
If nil, start from a preceding tag at indentation.<a name="dired-mark-files-in-region"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-mark-files-in-region</h3></p>
<p>

(fn START END)<a name="find-multibyte-characters"></a>
<h3>Function: find-multibyte-characters</h3>
Find multibyte characters in the region specified by FROM and TO.
If FROM is a string, find multibyte characters in the string.
The return value is an alist of the following format:
  ((CHARSET COUNT CHAR ...) ...)
where
  CHARSET is a character set,
  COUNT is a number of characters,
  CHARs are the characters found from the character set.
Optional 3rd arg MAXCOUNT limits how many CHARs are put in the above list.
Optional 4th arg EXCLUDES is a list of character sets to be ignored.<a name="normal-erase-is-backspace-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: normal-erase-is-backspace-mode</h3>
Toggle the Erase and Delete mode of the Backspace and Delete keys.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable this feature if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
On window systems, when this mode is on, Delete is mapped to C-d
and Backspace is mapped to DEL; when this mode is off, both
Delete and Backspace are mapped to DEL.  (The remapping goes via
`local-function-key-map', so binding Delete or Backspace in the
global or local keymap will override that.)</p>
<p>
In addition, on window systems, the bindings of C-Delete, M-Delete,
C-M-Delete, C-Backspace, M-Backspace, and C-M-Backspace are changed in
the global keymap in accordance with the functionality of Delete and
Backspace.  For example, if Delete is remapped to C-d, which deletes
forward, C-Delete is bound to `kill-word', but if Delete is remapped
to DEL, which deletes backward, C-Delete is bound to
`backward-kill-word'.</p>
<p>
If not running on a window system, a similar effect is accomplished by
remapping C-h (normally produced by the Backspace key) and DEL via
`keyboard-translate': if this mode is on, C-h is mapped to DEL and DEL
to C-d; if it's off, the keys are not remapped.</p>
<p>
When not running on a window system, and this mode is turned on, the
former functionality of C-h is available on the F1 key.  You should
probably not turn on this mode on a text-only terminal if you don't
have both Backspace, Delete and F1 keys.</p>
<p>
See also `normal-erase-is-backspace'.<a name="ert--expand-should"></a>
<h3>Function: ert--expand-should</h3>
Helper function for the `should' macro and its variants.</p>
<p>
Analyzes FORM and returns an expression that has the same
semantics under evaluation but records additional debugging
information.</p>
<p>
INNER-EXPANDER should be a function and is called with two
arguments: INNER-FORM and FORM-DESCRIPTION-FORM, where INNER-FORM
is an expression equivalent to FORM, and FORM-DESCRIPTION-FORM is
an expression that returns a description of FORM.  INNER-EXPANDER
should return code that calls INNER-FORM and performs the checks
and error signaling specific to the particular variant of
`should'.  The code that INNER-EXPANDER returns must not call
FORM-DESCRIPTION-FORM before it has called INNER-FORM.<a name="completion-in-region-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: completion-in-region-mode</h3>
Transient minor mode used during `completion-in-region'.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable the modemode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>

BOOKMARK is a bookmark name or a bookmark record.</p>
<p>
(fn BOOKMARK)<a name="goto-line"></a>
<h3>Function: goto-line</h3>
Go to LINE, counting from line 1 at beginning of buffer.
If called interactively, a numeric prefix argument specifies
LINE; without a numeric prefix argument, read LINE from the
minibuffer.</p>
<p>
If optional argument BUFFER is non-nil, switch to that buffer and
move to line LINE there.  If called interactively with C-u
as argument, BUFFER is the most recently selected other buffer.</p>
<p>
Prior to moving point, this function sets the mark (without
activating it), unless Transient Mark mode is enabled and the
mark is already active.</p>
<p>
This function is usually the wrong thing to use in a Lisp program.
What you probably want instead is something like:
  (goto-char (point-min))
  (forward-line (1- N))
If at all possible, an even better solution is to use char counts
rather than line counts.<a name="menu-bar-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: menu-bar-mode</h3>
Toggle display of a menu bar on each frame (Menu Bar mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Menu Bar mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
Menu Bar mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
This command applies to all frames that exist and frames to be
created in the future.<a name="-grade-down"></a>

<h3>Function: window-point</h3>
Return current value of point in WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
For a nonselected window, this is the value point would have if that
window were selected.</p>
<p>
Note that, when WINDOW is selected, the value returned is the same as
that returned by `point' for WINDOW's buffer.  It would be more strictly
correct to return the `top-level' value of `point', outside of any
`save-excursion' forms.  But that is hard to define.</p>

elements of these nested lists.</p>
<p>
Then reduce the resulting lists using FOLDER and initial value
INIT-VALUE. See `-reduce-r-from'.</p>
<p>
This is the same as calling `-tree-reduce' after `-tree-map'

frame's terminal).</p>
<p>
(fn &optional TTY)<a name="parse-partial-sexp"></a>
<h3>Function: parse-partial-sexp</h3>
Parse Lisp syntax starting at FROM until TO; return status of parse at TO.
Parsing stops at TO or when certain criteria are met;
 point is set to where parsing stops.
If fifth arg OLDSTATE is omitted or nil,
 parsing assumes that FROM is the beginning of a function.
Value is a list of elements describing final state of parsing:
 0. depth in parens.
 1. character address of start of innermost containing list; nil if none.
 2. character address of start of last complete sexp terminated.
 3. non-nil if inside a string.
    (it is the character that will terminate the string,
     or t if the string should be terminated by a generic string delimiter.)
 4. nil if outside a comment, t if inside a non-nestable comment,
    else an integer (the current comment nesting).
 5. t if following a quote character.
 6. the minimum paren-depth encountered during this scan.
 7. style of comment, if any.
 8. character address of start of comment or string; nil if not in one.
 9. Intermediate data for continuation of parsing (subject to change).
If third arg TARGETDEPTH is non-nil, parsing stops if the depth
in parentheses becomes equal to TARGETDEPTH.
Fourth arg STOPBEFORE non-nil means stop when come to
 any character that starts a sexp.
Fifth arg OLDSTATE is a list like what this function returns.
 It is used to initialize the state of the parse.  Elements number 1, 2, 6
 are ignored.
Sixth arg COMMENTSTOP non-nil means stop at the start of a comment.
 If it is symbol `syntax-table', stop after the start of a comment or a
 string, or after end of a comment or a string.</p>

<p>
(fn ABBREV &optional NAME WORDSTART WORDEND)<a name="hi-lock-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: hi-lock-mode</h3>
Toggle selective highlighting of patterns (Hi Lock mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Hi Lock mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Hi Lock mode is automatically enabled when you invoke any of the
highlighting commands listed below, such as M-s h r.
To enable Hi Lock mode in all buffers, use `global-hi-lock-mode'
or add (global-hi-lock-mode 1) to your init file.</p>
<p>
In buffers where Font Lock mode is enabled, patterns are
highlighted using font lock.  In buffers where Font Lock mode is
disabled, patterns are applied using overlays; in this case, the
highlighting will not be updated as you type.</p>
<p>
When Hi Lock mode is enabled, a "Regexp Highlighting" submenu
is added to the "Edit" menu.  The commands in the submenu,
which can be called interactively, are:</p>
<p>
M-s h r REGEXP FACE
  Highlight matches of pattern REGEXP in current buffer with FACE.</p>
<p>
M-s h p PHRASE FACE
  Highlight matches of phrase PHRASE in current buffer with FACE.
  (PHRASE can be any REGEXP, but spaces will be replaced by matches
  to whitespace and initial lower-case letters will become case insensitive.)</p>
<p>
M-s h l REGEXP FACE
  Highlight lines containing matches of REGEXP in current buffer with FACE.</p>
<p>
M-s h u REGEXP
  Remove highlighting on matches of REGEXP in current buffer.</p>
<p>
M-s h w
  Write active REGEXPs into buffer as comments (if possible).  They may
  be read the next time file is loaded or when the M-s h f command
  is issued.  The inserted regexps are in the form of font lock keywords.
  (See `font-lock-keywords'.)  They may be edited and re-loaded with M-s h f,
  any valid `font-lock-keywords' form is acceptable.  When a file is
  loaded the patterns are read if `hi-lock-file-patterns-policy' is
  'ask and the user responds y to the prompt, or if
  `hi-lock-file-patterns-policy' is bound to a function and that
  function returns t.</p>
<p>
M-s h f
  Re-read patterns stored in buffer (in the format produced by M-s h w).</p>
<p>
When hi-lock is started and if the mode is not excluded or patterns
rejected, the beginning of the buffer is searched for lines of the
form:
  Hi-lock: FOO</p>
<p>
where FOO is a list of patterns.  The patterns must start before
position (number of characters into buffer)
`hi-lock-file-patterns-range'.  Patterns will be read until
Hi-lock: end is found.  A mode is excluded if it's in the list
`hi-lock-exclude-modes'.</p>

<h3>Function: shell-dynamic-complete-environment-variable</h3>
Dynamically complete the environment variable at point.
Completes if after a variable, i.e., if it starts with a "$".</p>
<p>
This function is similar to `comint-dynamic-complete-filename', except that it
searches `process-environment' for completion candidates.  Note that this may
not be the same as the interpreter's idea of variable names.  The main problem
with this type of completion is that `process-environment' is the environment
which Emacs started with.  Emacs does not track changes to the environment made
by the interpreter.  Perhaps it would be more accurate if this function was
called `shell-dynamic-complete-process-environment-variable'.</p>

of the `custom-links' for a variable.</p>
<p>
Any `custom-load' autoloads in variables are loaded in order to
get full link information.  This will be a lot of Lisp packages
and can take a long time.</p>

(fn)<a name="global-highlight-changes-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: global-highlight-changes-mode</h3>
Toggle Highlight-Changes mode in all buffers.
With prefix ARG, enable Global-Highlight-Changes mode if ARG is positive;
otherwise, disable it.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode if
ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Highlight-Changes mode is enabled in all buffers where
`highlight-changes-mode-turn-on' would do it.
See `highlight-changes-mode' for more information on Highlight-Changes mode.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="format"></a>
<h3>Function: format</h3>
Format a string out of a format-string and arguments.
The first argument is a format control string.
The other arguments are substituted into it to make the result, a string.</p>
<p>
The format control string may contain %-sequences meaning to substitute
the next available argument:</p>
<p>
%s means print a string argument.  Actually, prints any object, with `princ'.
%d means print as number in decimal (%o octal, %x hex).
%X is like %x, but uses upper case.
%e means print a number in exponential notation.
%f means print a number in decimal-point notation.
%g means print a number in exponential notation
  or decimal-point notation, whichever uses fewer characters.
%c means print a number as a single character.
%S means print any object as an s-expression (using `prin1').</p>
<p>
The argument used for %d, %o, %x, %e, %f, %g or %c must be a number.
Use %% to put a single % into the output.</p>
<p>
A %-sequence may contain optional flag, width, and precision
specifiers, as follows:</p>
<p>
  %<flags><width><precision>character</p>
<p>
where flags is [+ #-0]+, width is [0-9]+, and precision is .[0-9]+</p>
<p>
The + flag character inserts a + before any positive number, while a
space inserts a space before any positive number; these flags only
affect %d, %e, %f, and %g sequences, and the + flag takes precedence.
The - and 0 flags affect the width specifier, as described below.</p>
<p>
The # flag means to use an alternate display form for %o, %x, %X, %e,
%f, and %g sequences: for %o, it ensures that the result begins with
"0"; for %x and %X, it prefixes the result with "0x" or "0X";
for %e, %f, and %g, it causes a decimal point to be included even if
the precision is zero.</p>
<p>
The width specifier supplies a lower limit for the length of the
printed representation.  The padding, if any, normally goes on the
left, but it goes on the right if the - flag is present.  The padding
character is normally a space, but it is 0 if the 0 flag is present.
The 0 flag is ignored if the - flag is present, or the format sequence
is something other than %d, %e, %f, and %g.</p>
<p>
For %e, %f, and %g sequences, the number after the "." in the
precision specifier says how many decimal places to show; if zero, the
decimal point itself is omitted.  For %s and %S, the precision
specifier truncates the string to the given width.</p>

   relative to the opposite frame edge from that in the original spec.
FRAME defaults to the selected frame.</p>
<p>
Examples (measures in pixels) -
 Assuming display height=1024, frame height=600:
 top 300 below display top:               (top .  300) => (top +  300)
                                          (top +  300) => (top +  300)

Optional 5th argument NIL-FOR-TOO-LONG non-nil means return nil
 even if ALIST is not deep enough.<a name="gnus-delay-initialize"></a>
<h3>Function: gnus-delay-initialize</h3>
Initialize the gnus-delay package.
This sets up a key binding in `message-mode' to delay a message.
This tells Gnus to look for delayed messages after getting new news.</p>
<p>
The optional arg NO-KEYMAP is ignored.
Checking delayed messages is skipped if optional arg NO-CHECK is non-nil.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional NO-KEYMAP NO-CHECK)<a name="minibuffer-prompt-end"></a>

(fn BYTEPOS)<a name="auto-fill-function"></a>
<h3>Function: auto-fill-function</h3>
Automatically break line at a previous space, in insertion of text.<a name="select-window"></a>
<h3>Function: select-window</h3>
Select WINDOW which must be a live window.
Also make WINDOW's frame the selected frame and WINDOW that frame's
selected window.  In addition, make WINDOW's buffer current and set that
buffer's value of `point' to the value of WINDOW's `window-point'.
Return WINDOW.</p>
<p>
Optional second arg NORECORD non-nil means do not put this buffer at the
front of the buffer list and do not make this window the most recently
selected one.</p>
<p>
Note that the main editor command loop sets the current buffer to the
buffer of the selected window before each command.</p>
<p>
(fn WINDOW &optional NORECORD)<a name="equalp"></a>
<h3>Function: equalp</h3>
Return t if two Lisp objects have similar structures and contents.
This is like `equal', except that it accepts numerically equal
numbers of different types (float vs. integer), and also compares
strings case-insensitively.</p>
<p>
(fn X Y)<a name="xml-parse-file"></a>
<h3>Function: xml-parse-file</h3>
Parse the well-formed XML file FILE.
Return the top node with all its children.
If PARSE-DTD is non-nil, the DTD is parsed rather than skipped.</p>
<p>
If PARSE-NS is non-nil, then QNAMES are expanded.  By default,
the variable `xml-default-ns' is the mapping from namespaces to
URIs, and expanded names will be returned as a cons</p>
<p>
  ("namespace:" . "foo").</p>
<p>
If PARSE-NS is an alist, it will be used as the mapping from
namespace to URIs instead.</p>
<p>
If it is the symbol 'symbol-qnames, expanded names will be
returned as a plain symbol 'namespace:foo instead of a cons.</p>
<p>
Both features can be combined by providing a cons cell</p>
<p>
  (symbol-qnames . ALIST).</p>
<p>
(fn FILE &optional PARSE-DTD PARSE-NS)<a name="thumbs"></a>
<h3>Function: thumbs</h3>

<p>

(fn)<a name="auth-source-macos-keychain-search"></a>
<h3>Function: auth-source-macos-keychain-search</h3>
Search the MacOS Keychain; spec is like `auth-source'.</p>
<p>
All search keys must match exactly.  If you need substring
matching, do a wider search and narrow it down yourself.</p>
<p>
You'll get back all the properties of the token as a plist.</p>
<p>
The :type key is either 'macos-keychain-internet or
'macos-keychain-generic.</p>
<p>
For the internet keychain type, the :label key searches the
item's labels ("-l LABEL" passed to "/usr/bin/security").
Similarly, :host maps to "-s HOST", :user maps to "-a USER",
and :port maps to "-P PORT" or "-r PROT"
(note PROT has to be a 4-character string).</p>
<p>
For the generic keychain type, the :label key searches the item's
labels ("-l LABEL" passed to "/usr/bin/security").
Similarly, :host maps to "-c HOST" (the "creator" keychain
field), :user maps to "-a USER", and :port maps to "-s PORT".</p>
<p>
Here's an example that looks for the first item in the default
generic MacOS Keychain:</p>
<p>
 (let ((auth-sources '(macos-keychain-generic)))
    (auth-source-search :max 1)</p>
<p>
Here's another that looks for the first item in the internet
MacOS Keychain collection whose label is 'gnus':</p>
<p>
 (let ((auth-sources '(macos-keychain-internet)))
    (auth-source-search :max 1 :label "gnus")</p>
<p>
And this one looks for the first item in the internet keychain
entries for git.gnus.org:</p>
<p>
 (let ((auth-sources '(macos-keychain-internet")))
    (auth-source-search :max 1 :host "git.gnus.org"))</p>

This function only has an effect on X Windows.  With MS Windows, it is
defined but does nothing.</p>
<p>
If ON is nil, allow buffering of requests.
Turning on synchronization prohibits the Xlib routines from buffering
requests and seriously degrades performance, but makes debugging much
easier.
The optional second argument TERMINAL specifies which display to act on.
TERMINAL should be a terminal object, a frame or a display name (a string).
If TERMINAL is omitted or nil, that stands for the selected frame's display.</p>

<h3>Function: tty-color-desc</h3>
Return the description of the color COLOR for a character terminal.
Value is a list of the form (NAME INDEX R G B).  The returned NAME or
RGB value may not be the same as the argument COLOR, because the latter
might need to be approximated if it is not supported directly.<a name="isearch-highlight-regexp"></a>
<h3>Function: isearch-highlight-regexp</h3>
Run `highlight-regexp' with regexp from the current search string.
It exits Isearch mode and calls `hi-lock-face-buffer' with its regexp

if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)<a name="modify-face"></a>
<h3>Function: modify-face</h3>
Modify attributes of faces interactively.
If optional argument FRAME is nil or omitted, modify the face used
for newly created frame, i.e. the global face.
For non-interactive use, `set-face-attribute' is preferred.
When called from Lisp, if FACE is nil, all arguments but FRAME are ignored
and the face and its settings are obtained by querying the user.<a name="compose-chars-after"></a>
<h3>Function: compose-chars-after</h3>
Compose characters in current buffer after position POS.</p>
<p>
It looks up the char-table `composition-function-table' (which
see) by a character at POS, and compose characters after POS
according to the contents of `composition-function-table'.</p>
<p>
Optional 2nd arg LIMIT, if non-nil, limits characters to compose.</p>
<p>
Optional 3rd arg OBJECT, if non-nil, is a string that contains the

ARG may be one of the following forms:</p>
<p>
STRING
     Return ARG unchanged.</p>
<p>
`source', `source-inplace'
     Create a temporary file to check and return its path.  With
     `source-inplace' create the temporary file in the same
     directory as the original file.  The value of
     `flycheck-temp-prefix' is used as prefix of the file name.</p>
<p>
     With `source', try to retain the non-directory component of
     the buffer's file name in the temporary file.</p>
<p>
     `source' is the preferred way to pass the input file to a
     syntax checker.  `source-inplace' should only be used if the
     syntax checker needs other files from the source directory,
     such as include files in C.</p>
<p>
`source-original'
     Return the path of the actual file to check, or an empty
     string if the buffer has no file name.</p>
<p>
     Note that the contents of the file may not be up to date
     with the contents of the buffer to check.  Do not use this
     as primary input to a checker, unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>
     When using this symbol as primary input to the syntax
     checker, add `flycheck-buffer-saved-p' to the `:predicate'.</p>
<p>
`temporary-directory'
     Create a unique temporary directory and return its path.</p>
<p>
`temporary-file-name'

     first.</p>
<p>
`null-device'
     Return the value of `null-device', i.e the system null
     device.</p>
<p>
     Use this option to ignore the output of a syntax checker.
     If the syntax checker cannot handle the null device, or
     won't write to an existing file, try `temporary-file-name'
     instead.</p>
<p>
`(config-file OPTION VARIABLE [PREPEND-FN])'
     Search the configuration file bound to VARIABLE with
     `flycheck-locate-config-file' and return a list of arguments
     that pass this configuration file to the syntax checker, or
     nil if the configuration file was not found.</p>
<p>
     PREPEND-FN is called with the OPTION and the located
     configuration file, and should return OPTION prepended
     before the file, either a string or as list.  If omitted,
     PREPEND-FN defaults to `list'.</p>
<p>
`(option OPTION VARIABLE [PREPEND-FN [FILTER]])'
     Retrieve the value of VARIABLE and return a list of
     arguments that pass this value as value for OPTION to the
     syntax checker.</p>
<p>
     PREPEND-FN is called with the OPTION and the value of
     VARIABLE, and should return OPTION prepended before the
     file, either a string or as list.  If omitted, PREPEND-FN
     defaults to `list'.</p>
<p>
     FILTER is an optional function to be applied to the value of
     VARIABLE before prepending.  This function must return nil
     or a string.  In the former case, return nil.  In the latter
     case, return a list of arguments as described above.</p>
<p>
`(option-list OPTION VARIABLE [PREPEND-FN [FILTER]])'
     Retrieve the value of VARIABLE, which must be a list,
     and prepend OPTION before each item in this list, using
     PREPEND-FN.</p>
<p>
     PREPEND-FN is called with the OPTION and each item of the
     list as second argument, and should return OPTION prepended
     before the item, either as string or as list.  If omitted,
     PREPEND-FN defaults to `list'.</p>
<p>
     FILTER is an optional function to be applied to each item in
     the list before prepending OPTION.  It shall return the
     option value for each item as string, or nil, if the item is
     to be ignored.</p>
<p>
`(option-flag OPTION VARIABLE)'
     Retrieve the value of VARIABLE and return OPTION, if the
     value is non-nil.  Otherwise return nil.</p>
<p>
`(eval FORM)'
     Return the result of evaluating FORM in the buffer to be
     checked.  FORM must either return a string or a list of
     strings, or nil to indicate that nothing should be
     substituted for CELL.  For all other return types, signal an
     error</p>
<p>
     _No_ further substitutions are performed, neither in FORM
     before it is evaluated, nor in the result of evaluating
     FORM.</p>
<p>
In all other cases, signal an error.</p>
<p>
Note that substitution is *not* recursive.  No symbols or cells
are substituted within the body of cells!<a name="set-language-info-alist"></a>
<h3>Function: set-language-info-alist</h3>
Store ALIST as the definition of language environment LANG-ENV.
ALIST is an alist of KEY and INFO values.  See the documentation of
`language-info-alist' for the meanings of KEY and INFO.</p>
<p>
Optional arg PARENTS is a list of parent menu names; it specifies
where to put this language environment in the
Describe Language Environment and Set Language Environment menus.
For example, ("European") means to put this language environment
in the European submenu in each of those two menus.<a name="dbus-init-bus"></a>
<h3>Function: dbus-init-bus</h3>
Establish the connection to D-Bus BUS.</p>
<p>
BUS can be either the symbol `:system' or the symbol `:session', or it
can be a string denoting the address of the corresponding bus.  For
the system and session buses, this function is called when loading
`dbus.el', there is no need to call it again.</p>
<p>
The function returns a number, which counts the connections this Emacs
session has established to the BUS under the same unique name (see
`dbus-get-unique-name').  It depends on the libraries Emacs is linked
with, and on the environment Emacs is running.  For example, if Emacs
is linked with the gtk toolkit, and it runs in a GTK-aware environment
like Gnome, another connection might already be established.</p>
<p>
When PRIVATE is non-nil, a new connection is established instead of
reusing an existing one.  It results in a new unique name at the bus.
This can be used, if it is necessary to distinguish from another
connection used in the same Emacs process, like the one established by
GTK+.  It should be used with care for at least the `:system' and
`:session' buses, because other Emacs Lisp packages might already use
this connection to those buses.</p>
<p>
(fn BUS &optional PRIVATE)<a name="point-max-marker"></a>
<h3>Function: point-max-marker</h3>
Return a marker to the maximum permissible value of point in this buffer.

<p>
(fn &optional FORCE)<a name="get-largest-window"></a>
<h3>Function: get-largest-window</h3>
Return the largest window on frames specified by ALL-FRAMES.
A minibuffer window is never a candidate.  A dedicated window is
never a candidate unless DEDICATED is non-nil, so if all windows
are dedicated, the value is nil.  Optional argument NOT-SELECTED
non-nil means never return the selected window.</p>
<p>
The following non-nil values of the optional argument ALL-FRAMES
have special meanings:</p>
<p>
- t means consider all windows on all existing frames.</p>
<p>
- `visible' means consider all windows on all visible frames on
  the current terminal.</p>
<p>
- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible
  and iconified frames on the current terminal.</p>
<p>
- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.</p>
<p>
Any other value of ALL-FRAMES means consider all windows on the
selected frame and no others.<a name="profiler-cpu-start"></a>
<h3>Function: profiler-cpu-start</h3>

<h3>Function: x-select-text</h3>
Select TEXT, a string, according to the window system.</p>
<p>
On X, if `x-select-enable-clipboard' is non-nil, copy TEXT to the
clipboard.  If `x-select-enable-primary' is non-nil, put TEXT in
the primary selection.</p>
<p>
On MS-Windows, make TEXT the current selection.  If
`x-select-enable-clipboard' is non-nil, copy the text to the
clipboard as well.</p>
<p>
On Nextstep, put TEXT in the pasteboard (`x-select-enable-clipboard'
is not used).<a name="days-between"></a>
<h3>Function: days-between</h3>
Return the number of days between DATE1 and DATE2.
DATE1 and DATE2 should be date-time strings.<a name="url-cookie-parse-file"></a>

MAP and PATH are as defined in `easy-menu-add-item'.</p>
<p>
TO-MODIFY, if non-nil, is the name of the item the caller
wants to modify in the map that we return.
In some cases we use that to select between the local and global maps.<a name="timeclock-workday-remaining-string"></a>
<h3>Function: timeclock-workday-remaining-string</h3>
Return a string representing the amount of time left today.
Display second resolution if SHOW-SECONDS is non-nil.  If TODAY-ONLY

"relative to today".</p>
<p>
(fn &optional SHOW-SECONDS TODAY-ONLY)<a name="thing-at-point"></a>
<h3>Function: thing-at-point</h3>
Return the THING at point.
THING should be a symbol specifying a type of syntactic entity.
Possibilities include `symbol', `list', `sexp', `defun',
`filename', `url', `email', `word', `sentence', `whitespace',
`line', `number', and `page'.</p>
<p>
See the file `thingatpt.el' for documentation on how to define
a symbol as a valid THING.<a name="-select-columns"></a>
<h3>Function: -select-columns</h3>
Select COLUMNS from TABLE.</p>
<p>
TABLE is a list of lists where each element represents one row.
It is assumed each row has the same length.</p>
<p>
Each row is transformed such that only the specified COLUMNS are
selected.</p>
<p>
See also: `-select-column', `-select-by-indices'</p>
<p>
(fn COLUMNS TABLE)<a name="-all-p"></a>
<h3>Function: -all-p</h3>
Return t if (PRED x) is non-nil for all x in LIST, else nil.</p>
<p>
Alias: `-all-p', `-every?', `-every-p'</p>
<p>
(fn PRED LIST)<a name="byte-compile-eval-before-compile"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-compile-eval-before-compile</h3>
Evaluate FORM for `eval-and-compile'.</p>
<p>
(fn FORM)<a name="dired-read-shell-command"></a>
<h3>Function: dired-read-shell-command</h3>
Read a dired shell command.
PROMPT should be a format string with one "%s" format sequence,
which is replaced by the value returned by `dired-mark-prompt',
with ARG and FILES as its arguments.  FILES should be a list of
file names.  The result is used as the prompt.</p>
<p>
This normally reads using `read-shell-command', but if the
`dired-x' package is loaded, use `dired-guess-shell-command' to
offer a smarter default choice of shell command.<a name="calc-grab-rectangle"></a>
<h3>Function: calc-grab-rectangle</h3>
Parse a rectangle as a matrix of numbers and push it on the Calculator stack.</p>
<p>
(fn TOP BOT ARG)<a name="split-window-vertically"></a>
<h3>Function: split-window-vertically</h3>
Split the selected window into two windows, one above the other.
The selected window is above.  The newly split-off window is
below, and displays the same buffer.  Return the new window.</p>
<p>
If optional argument SIZE is omitted or nil, both windows get the
same height, or close to it.  If SIZE is positive, the upper
(selected) window gets SIZE lines.  If SIZE is negative, the
lower (new) window gets -SIZE lines.</p>
<p>
If the variable `split-window-keep-point' is non-nil, both
windows get the same value of point as the selected window.
Otherwise, the window starts are chosen so as to minimize the
amount of redisplay; this is convenient on slow terminals.<a name="+"></a>
<h3>Function: +</h3>
Return sum of any number of arguments, which are numbers or markers.</p>
<p>
(fn &rest NUMBERS-OR-MARKERS)<a name="widget-field-text-end"></a>
<h3>Function: widget-field-text-end</h3></p>
<p>

(fn WIDGET)<a name="delete-to-left-margin"></a>
<h3>Function: delete-to-left-margin</h3>
Remove left margin indentation from a region.
This deletes to the column given by `current-left-margin'.
In no case will it delete non-whitespace.
Args FROM and TO are optional; default is the whole buffer.<a name="*"></a>

<p>

(fn CL-X)<a name="byte-compile-dest-file"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-compile-dest-file</h3>
Convert an Emacs Lisp source file name to a compiled file name.
If `byte-compile-dest-file-function' is non-nil, uses that
function to do the work.  Otherwise, if FILENAME matches
`emacs-lisp-file-regexp' (by default, files with the extension `.el'),
adds `c' to it; otherwise adds `.elc'.</p>
<p>
(fn FILENAME)<a name="comint-accumulate"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-accumulate</h3>
Accumulate a line to send as input along with more lines.
This inserts a newline so that you can enter more text
to be sent along with this line.  Use M-x comint-send-input
to send all the accumulated input, at once.
The entire accumulated text becomes one item in the input history
when you send it.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="auto-raise-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: auto-raise-mode</h3>
Toggle whether or not selected frames should auto-raise.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Auto Raise mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Auto Raise mode does nothing under most window managers, which
switch focus on mouse clicks.  It only has an effect if your
window manager switches focus on mouse movement (in which case
you should also change `focus-follows-mouse' to t).  Then,
enabling Auto Raise mode causes any graphical Emacs frame which
acquires focus to be automatically raised.</p>
<p>
Note that this minor mode controls Emacs's own auto-raise
feature.  Window managers that switch focus on mouse movement
often have their own auto-raise feature.<a name="mm-uu-dissect"></a>
<h3>Function: mm-uu-dissect</h3>
Dissect the current buffer and return a list of uu handles.
The optional NOHEADER means there's no header in the buffer.

Use the `find' command to add files to the file cache.
Find is run in DIRECTORY.</p>
<p>
(fn DIRECTORY)<a name="setenv"></a>
<h3>Function: setenv</h3>
Set the value of the environment variable named VARIABLE to VALUE.
VARIABLE should be a string.  VALUE is optional; if not provided or
nil, the environment variable VARIABLE will be removed.</p>
<p>
Interactively, a prefix argument means to unset the variable, and
otherwise the current value (if any) of the variable appears at
the front of the history list when you type in the new value.
This function always replaces environment variables in the new
value when called interactively.</p>
<p>
SUBSTITUTE-ENV-VARS, if non-nil, means to substitute environment
variables in VALUE with `substitute-env-vars', which see.
This is normally used only for interactive calls.</p>
<p>
The return value is the new value of VARIABLE, or nil if
it was removed from the environment.</p>
<p>
This function works by modifying `process-environment'.</p>
<p>
As a special case, setting variable `TZ' calls `set-time-zone-rule' as
a side-effect.<a name="set-terminal-coding-system"></a>
<h3>Function: set-terminal-coding-system</h3>
Set coding system of terminal output to CODING-SYSTEM.
All text output to TERMINAL will be encoded
with the specified coding system.</p>
<p>
For a list of possible values of CODING-SYSTEM, use M-x list-coding-systems.
The default is determined by the selected language environment
or by the previous use of this command.</p>
<p>
TERMINAL may be a terminal object, a frame, or nil for the
selected frame's terminal.  The setting has no effect on
graphical terminals.<a name="custom-add-link"></a>

The names are separated by a space.
With a zero prefix arg, use the absolute file name of each marked file.
With C-u, use the file name relative to the dired buffer's
`default-directory'.  (This still may contain slashes if in a subdirectory.)</p>
<p>
If on a subdir headerline, use absolute subdirname instead;
prefix arg and marked files are ignored in this case.</p>
<p>
You can then feed the file name(s) to other commands with C-y.</p>

<p>
(fn)<a name="vhdl-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: vhdl-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing VHDL code.</p>
<p>
Usage:
------</p>
<p>
  TEMPLATE INSERTION (electrification):
    After typing a VHDL keyword and entering `SPC', you are prompted for
    arguments while a template is generated for that VHDL construct.  Typing
    `RET' or `C-g' at the first (mandatory) prompt aborts the current
    template generation.  Optional arguments are indicated by square
    brackets and removed if the queried string is left empty.  Prompts for
    mandatory arguments remain in the code if the queried string is left
    empty.  They can be queried again by `C-c C-t C-q'.  Enabled
    electrification is indicated by `/e' in the mode line.</p>
<p>
      Typing `M-SPC' after a keyword inserts a space without calling the
    template generator.  Automatic template generation (i.e.
    electrification) can be disabled (enabled) by typing `C-c C-m C-e' or by
    setting option `vhdl-electric-mode' (see OPTIONS).</p>
<p>
      Template generators can be invoked from the VHDL menu, by key
    bindings, by typing `C-c C-i C-c' and choosing a construct, or by typing
    the keyword (i.e. first word of menu entry not in parenthesis) and
    `SPC'.  The following abbreviations can also be used: arch, attr, cond,
    conf, comp, cons, func, inst, pack, sig, var.</p>
<p>
      Template styles can be customized in customization group
    `vhdl-template' (see OPTIONS).</p>
<p>

  HEADER INSERTION:
    A file header can be inserted by `C-c C-t C-h'.  A file footer
    (template at the end of the file) can be inserted by `C-c C-t C-f'.
    See customization group `vhdl-header'.</p>
<p>

  STUTTERING:
    Double striking of some keys inserts cumbersome VHDL syntax elements.
    Stuttering can be disabled (enabled) by typing `C-c C-m C-s' or by
    option `vhdl-stutter-mode'.  Enabled stuttering is indicated by `/s' in
    the mode line.  The stuttering keys and their effects are:</p>
<p>
      ;;   -->  " : "       [   -->  (        --    -->  comment
      ;;;  -->  " := "      [[  -->  [        --CR  -->  comment-out code
      ..   -->  " => "      ]   -->  )        ---   -->  horizontal line
      ,,   -->  " <= "      ]]  -->  ]        ----  -->  display comment
      ==   -->  " == "      ''  -->  \"</p>
<p>

  WORD COMPLETION:
    Typing `TAB' after a (not completed) word looks for a VHDL keyword or a
    word in the buffer that starts alike, inserts it and adjusts case.
    Re-typing `TAB' toggles through alternative word completions.  This also
    works in the minibuffer (i.e. in template generator prompts).</p>
<p>
      Typing `TAB' after `(' looks for and inserts complete parenthesized
    expressions (e.g. for array index ranges).  All keywords as well as
    standard types and subprograms of VHDL have predefined abbreviations
    (e.g. type "std" and `TAB' will toggle through all standard types
    beginning with "std").</p>
<p>
      Typing `TAB' after a non-word character indents the line if at the
    beginning of a line (i.e. no preceding non-blank characters), and
    inserts a tabulator stop otherwise.  `M-TAB' always inserts a tabulator
    stop.</p>
<p>

  COMMENTS:
        `--'       puts a single comment.
        `---'      draws a horizontal line for separating code segments.
        `----'     inserts a display comment, i.e. two horizontal lines
                   with a comment in between.
        `--CR'     comments out code on that line.  Re-hitting CR comments
                   out following lines.
        `C-c C-c'  comments out a region if not commented out,
                   uncomments a region if already commented out.  Option
                   `comment-style' defines where the comment characters
                   should be placed (beginning of line, indent, etc.).</p>
<p>
      You are prompted for comments after object definitions (i.e. signals,
    variables, constants, ports) and after subprogram and process
    specifications if option `vhdl-prompt-for-comments' is non-nil.
    Comments are automatically inserted as additional labels (e.g. after
    begin statements) and as help comments if `vhdl-self-insert-comments' is
    non-nil.</p>
<p>
      Inline comments (i.e. comments after a piece of code on the same line)
    are indented at least to `vhdl-inline-comment-column'.  Comments go at
    maximum to `vhdl-end-comment-column'.  `RET' after a space in a comment
    will open a new comment line.  Typing beyond `vhdl-end-comment-column'
    in a comment automatically opens a new comment line.  `M-q' re-fills
    multi-line comments.</p>
<p>

  INDENTATION:
    `TAB' indents a line if at the beginning of the line.  The amount of
    indentation is specified by option `vhdl-basic-offset'.  `C-c C-i C-l'
    always indents the current line (is bound to `TAB' if option
    `vhdl-intelligent-tab' is nil).  If a region is active, `TAB' indents
    the entire region.</p>
<p>
      Indentation can be done for a group of lines (`C-c C-i C-g'), a region
    (`M-C-\') or the entire buffer (menu).  Argument and port lists are
    indented normally (nil) or relative to the opening parenthesis (non-nil)
    according to option `vhdl-argument-list-indent'.</p>
<p>
      If option `vhdl-indent-tabs-mode' is nil, spaces are used instead of
    tabs.  `M-x tabify' and `M-x untabify' allow to convert spaces to tabs
    and vice versa.</p>
<p>
      Syntax-based indentation can be very slow in large files.  Option
    `vhdl-indent-syntax-based' allows to use faster but simpler indentation.</p>
<p>
      Option `vhdl-indent-comment-like-next-code-line' controls whether
    comment lines are indented like the preceding or like the following code
    line.</p>
<p>

  ALIGNMENT:
    The alignment functions align operators, keywords, and inline comments
    to beautify the code.  `C-c C-a C-a' aligns a group of consecutive lines
    separated by blank lines, `C-c C-a C-i' a block of lines with same
    indent.  `C-c C-a C-l' aligns all lines belonging to a list enclosed by
    a pair of parentheses (e.g. port clause/map, argument list), and `C-c
    C-a C-d' all lines within the declarative part of a design unit.  `C-c
    C-a M-a' aligns an entire region.  `C-c C-a C-c' aligns inline comments
    for a group of lines, and `C-c C-a M-c' for a region.</p>
<p>
      If option `vhdl-align-groups' is non-nil, groups of code lines
    separated by special lines (see option `vhdl-align-group-separate') are
    aligned individually.  If option `vhdl-align-same-indent' is non-nil,
    blocks of lines with same indent are aligned separately.  Some templates
    are automatically aligned after generation if option `vhdl-auto-align'
    is non-nil.</p>
<p>
      Alignment tries to align inline comments at
    `vhdl-inline-comment-column' and tries inline comment not to exceed
    `vhdl-end-comment-column'.</p>
<p>
      `C-c C-x M-w' fixes up whitespace in a region.  That is, operator
    symbols are surrounded by one space, and multiple spaces are eliminated.</p>
<p>

  CODE FILLING:
    Code filling allows to condense code (e.g. sensitivity lists or port
    maps) by removing comments and newlines and re-wrapping so that all
    lines are maximally filled (block filling).  `C-c C-f C-f' fills a list
    enclosed by parenthesis, `C-c C-f C-g' a group of lines separated by
    blank lines, `C-c C-f C-i' a block of lines with same indent, and
    `C-c C-f M-f' an entire region.</p>
<p>

  CODE BEAUTIFICATION:
    `C-c M-b' and `C-c C-b' beautify the code of a region or of the entire
    buffer respectively.  This includes indentation, alignment, and case
    fixing.  Code beautification can also be run non-interactively using the
    command:</p>
<p>
      emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs filename.vhd -f vhdl-beautify-buffer</p>
<p>

  PORT TRANSLATION:
    Generic and port clauses from entity or component declarations can be
    copied (`C-c C-p C-w') and pasted as entity and component declarations,
    as component instantiations and corresponding internal constants and
    signals, as a generic map with constants as actual generics, and as
    internal signal initializations (menu).</p>
<p>
      To include formals in component instantiations, see option
    `vhdl-association-list-with-formals'.  To include comments in pasting,
    see options `vhdl-include-...-comments'.</p>
<p>
      A clause with several generic/port names on the same line can be
    flattened (`C-c C-p C-f') so that only one name per line exists.  The
    direction of ports can be reversed (`C-c C-p C-r'), i.e., inputs become
    outputs and vice versa, which can be useful in testbenches.  (This
    reversion is done on the internal data structure and is only reflected
    in subsequent paste operations.)</p>
<p>
      Names for actual ports, instances, testbenches, and
    design-under-test instances can be derived from existing names according
    to options `vhdl-...-name'.  See customization group `vhdl-port'.</p>
<p>

  SUBPROGRAM TRANSLATION:
    Similar functionality exists for copying/pasting the interface of
    subprograms (function/procedure).  A subprogram interface can be copied
    and then pasted as a subprogram declaration, body or call (uses
    association list with formals).</p>
<p>

  TESTBENCH GENERATION:
    A copied port can also be pasted as a testbench.  The generated
    testbench includes an entity, an architecture, and an optional
    configuration.  The architecture contains the component declaration and
    instantiation of the DUT as well as internal constant and signal
    declarations.  Additional user-defined templates can be inserted.  The
    names used for entity/architecture/configuration/DUT as well as the file
    structure to be generated can be customized. See customization group
   `vhdl-testbench'.</p>
<p>

  KEY BINDINGS:
    Key bindings (`C-c ...') exist for most commands (see in menu).</p>
<p>

  VHDL MENU:
    All commands can be found in the VHDL menu including their key bindings.</p>
<p>

  FILE BROWSER:
    The speedbar allows browsing of directories and file contents.  It can
    be accessed from the VHDL menu and is automatically opened if option
    `vhdl-speedbar-auto-open' is non-nil.</p>
<p>
      In speedbar, open files and directories with `mouse-2' on the name and
    browse/rescan their contents with `mouse-2'/`S-mouse-2' on the `+'.</p>
<p>

  DESIGN HIERARCHY BROWSER:
    The speedbar can also be used for browsing the hierarchy of design units
    contained in the source files of the current directory or the specified
    projects (see option `vhdl-project-alist').</p>
<p>
      The speedbar can be switched between file, directory hierarchy and
    project hierarchy browsing mode in the speedbar menu or by typing `f',
    `h' or `H' in speedbar.</p>
<p>
      In speedbar, open design units with `mouse-2' on the name and browse
    their hierarchy with `mouse-2' on the `+'.  Ports can directly be copied
    from entities and components (in packages).  Individual design units and
    complete designs can directly be compiled ("Make" menu entry).</p>
<p>
      The hierarchy is automatically updated upon saving a modified source
    file when option `vhdl-speedbar-update-on-saving' is non-nil.  The
    hierarchy is only updated for projects that have been opened once in the
    speedbar.  The hierarchy is cached between Emacs sessions in a file (see
    options in group `vhdl-speedbar').</p>
<p>
      Simple design consistency checks are done during scanning, such as
    multiple declarations of the same unit or missing primary units that are
    required by secondary units.</p>
<p>

  STRUCTURAL COMPOSITION:
    Enables simple structural composition.  `C-c C-m C-n' creates a skeleton
    for a new component.  Subcomponents (i.e. component declaration and
    instantiation) can be automatically placed from a previously read port
    (`C-c C-m C-p') or directly from the hierarchy browser (`P').  Finally,
    all subcomponents can be automatically connected using internal signals
    and ports (`C-c C-m C-w') following these rules:
      - subcomponent actual ports with same name are considered to be
        connected by a signal (internal signal or port)
      - signals that are only inputs to subcomponents are considered as
        inputs to this component -> input port created
      - signals that are only outputs from subcomponents are considered as
        outputs from this component -> output port created
      - signals that are inputs to AND outputs from subcomponents are
        considered as internal connections -> internal signal created</p>
<p>
      Purpose:  With appropriate naming conventions it is possible to
    create higher design levels with only a few mouse clicks or key
    strokes.  A new design level can be created by simply generating a new
    component, placing the required subcomponents from the hierarchy
    browser, and wiring everything automatically.</p>
<p>
      Note: Automatic wiring only works reliably on templates of new
    components and component instantiations that were created by VHDL mode.</p>
<p>
      Component declarations can be placed in a components package (option
    `vhdl-use-components-package') which can be automatically generated for
    an entire directory or project (`C-c C-m M-p').  The VHDL'93 direct
    component instantiation is also supported (option
    `vhdl-use-direct-instantiation').</p>
<p>
      Configuration declarations can automatically be generated either from
    the menu (`C-c C-m C-f') (for the architecture the cursor is in) or from
    the speedbar menu (for the architecture under the cursor).  The
    configurations can optionally be hierarchical (i.e. include all
    component levels of a hierarchical design, option
    `vhdl-compose-configuration-hierarchical') or include subconfigurations
    (option `vhdl-compose-configuration-use-subconfiguration').  For
    subcomponents in hierarchical configurations, the most-recently-analyzed
    (mra) architecture is selected.  If another architecture is desired, it
    can be marked as most-recently-analyzed (speedbar menu) before
    generating the configuration.</p>
<p>
      Note: Configurations of subcomponents (i.e. hierarchical configuration
    declarations) are currently not considered when displaying
    configurations in speedbar.</p>
<p>
      See the options group `vhdl-compose' for all relevant user options.</p>
<p>

  SOURCE FILE COMPILATION:
    The syntax of the current buffer can be analyzed by calling a VHDL
    compiler (menu, `C-c C-k').  The compiler to be used is specified by
    option `vhdl-compiler'.  The available compilers are listed in option
    `vhdl-compiler-alist' including all required compilation command,
    command options, compilation directory, and error message syntax
    information.  New compilers can be added.</p>
<p>
      All the source files of an entire design can be compiled by the `make'
    command (menu, `C-c M-C-k') if an appropriate Makefile exists.</p>
<p>

  MAKEFILE GENERATION:
    Makefiles can be generated automatically by an internal generation
    routine (`C-c M-k').  The library unit dependency information is
    obtained from the hierarchy browser.  Makefile generation can be
    customized for each compiler in option `vhdl-compiler-alist'.</p>
<p>
      Makefile generation can also be run non-interactively using the
    command:</p>
<p>
        emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -l vhdl-mode
              [-compiler compilername] [-project projectname]
              -f vhdl-generate-makefile</p>
<p>
      The Makefile's default target "all" compiles the entire design, the
    target "clean" removes it and the target "library" creates the
    library directory if not existent.  These target names can be customized
    by option `vhdl-makefile-default-targets'.  The Makefile also includes a
    target for each primary library unit which allows selective compilation
    of this unit, its secondary units and its subhierarchy (example:
    compilation of a design specified by a configuration).  User specific
    parts can be inserted into a Makefile with option
    `vhdl-makefile-generation-hook'.</p>
<p>
    Limitations:
      - Only library units and dependencies within the current library are
        considered.  Makefiles for designs that span multiple libraries are
        not (yet) supported.
      - Only one-level configurations are supported (also hierarchical),
        but configurations that go down several levels are not.
      - The "others" keyword in configurations is not supported.</p>
<p>

  PROJECTS:
    Projects can be defined in option `vhdl-project-alist' and a current
    project be selected using option `vhdl-project' (permanently) or from
    the menu or speedbar (temporarily).  For each project, title and
    description strings (for the file headers), source files/directories
    (for the hierarchy browser and Makefile generation), library name, and
    compiler-dependent options, exceptions and compilation directory can be
    specified.  Compilation settings overwrite the settings of option
    `vhdl-compiler-alist'.</p>
<p>
      Project setups can be exported (i.e. written to a file) and imported.
    Imported setups are not automatically saved in `vhdl-project-alist' but
    can be saved afterwards in its customization buffer.  When starting
    Emacs with VHDL Mode (i.e. load a VHDL file or use "emacs -l
    vhdl-mode") in a directory with an existing project setup file, it is
    automatically loaded and its project activated if option
    `vhdl-project-auto-load' is non-nil.  Names/paths of the project setup
    files can be specified in option `vhdl-project-file-name'.  Multiple
    project setups can be automatically loaded from global directories.
    This is an alternative to specifying project setups with option
    `vhdl-project-alist'.</p>
<p>

  SPECIAL MENUES:
    As an alternative to the speedbar, an index menu can be added (set
    option `vhdl-index-menu' to non-nil) or made accessible as a mouse menu
    (e.g. add "(global-set-key '[S-down-mouse-3] 'imenu)" to your start-up
    file) for browsing the file contents (is not populated if buffer is
    larger than `font-lock-maximum-size').  Also, a source file menu can be
    added (set option `vhdl-source-file-menu' to non-nil) for browsing the
    current directory for VHDL source files.</p>
<p>

  VHDL STANDARDS:
    The VHDL standards to be used are specified in option `vhdl-standard'.
    Available standards are: VHDL'87/'93(02), VHDL-AMS, and Math Packages.</p>
<p>

  KEYWORD CASE:
    Lower and upper case for keywords and standardized types, attributes,
    and enumeration values is supported.  If the option
    `vhdl-upper-case-keywords' is set to non-nil, keywords can be typed in
    lower case and are converted into upper case automatically (not for
    types, attributes, and enumeration values).  The case of keywords,
    types, attributes,and enumeration values can be fixed for an entire
    region (menu) or buffer (`C-c C-x C-c') according to the options
    `vhdl-upper-case-{keywords,types,attributes,enum-values}'.</p>
<p>

  HIGHLIGHTING (fontification):
    Keywords and standardized types, attributes, enumeration values, and
    function names (controlled by option `vhdl-highlight-keywords'), as well
    as comments, strings, and template prompts are highlighted using
    different colors.  Unit, subprogram, signal, variable, constant,
    parameter and generic/port names in declarations as well as labels are
    highlighted if option `vhdl-highlight-names' is non-nil.</p>
<p>
      Additional reserved words or words with a forbidden syntax (e.g. words
    that should be avoided) can be specified in option
    `vhdl-forbidden-words' or `vhdl-forbidden-syntax' and be highlighted in
    a warning color (option `vhdl-highlight-forbidden-words').  Verilog
    keywords are highlighted as forbidden words if option
    `vhdl-highlight-verilog-keywords' is non-nil.</p>
<p>
      Words with special syntax can be highlighted by specifying their
    syntax and color in option `vhdl-special-syntax-alist' and by setting
    option `vhdl-highlight-special-words' to non-nil.  This allows to
    establish some naming conventions (e.g. to distinguish different kinds
    of signals or other objects by using name suffices) and to support them
    visually.</p>
<p>
      Option `vhdl-highlight-case-sensitive' can be set to non-nil in order
    to support case-sensitive highlighting.  However, keywords are then only
    highlighted if written in lower case.</p>
<p>
      Code between "translate_off" and "translate_on" pragmas is
    highlighted using a different background color if option
    `vhdl-highlight-translate-off' is non-nil.</p>
<p>
      For documentation and customization of the used colors see
    customization group `vhdl-highlight-faces' (`M-x customize-group').  For
    highlighting of matching parenthesis, see customization group
    `paren-showing'.  Automatic buffer highlighting is turned on/off by
    option `global-font-lock-mode' (`font-lock-auto-fontify' in XEmacs).</p>
<p>

  USER MODELS:
    VHDL models (templates) can be specified by the user and made accessible
    in the menu, through key bindings (`C-c C-m ...'), or by keyword
    electrification.  See option `vhdl-model-alist'.</p>
<p>

  HIDE/SHOW:
    The code of blocks, processes, subprograms, component declarations and
    instantiations, generic/port clauses, and configuration declarations can
    be hidden using the `Hide/Show' menu or by pressing `S-mouse-2' within
    the code (see customization group `vhdl-menu').  XEmacs: limited
    functionality due to old `hideshow.el' package.</p>
<p>

  CODE UPDATING:
    - Sensitivity List: `C-c C-u C-s' updates the sensitivity list of the
      current process, `C-c C-u M-s' of all processes in the current buffer.
      Limitations:
        - Only declared local signals (ports, signals declared in
          architecture and blocks) are automatically inserted.
        - Global signals declared in packages are not automatically inserted.
          Insert them once manually (will be kept afterwards).
        - Out parameters of procedures are considered to be read.
      Use option `vhdl-entity-file-name' to specify the entity file name
      (used to obtain the port names).
      Use option `vhdl-array-index-record-field-in-sensitivity-list' to
      specify whether to include array indices and record fields in
      sensitivity lists.</p>
<p>

  CODE FIXING:
    `C-c C-x C-p' fixes the closing parenthesis of a generic/port clause
    (e.g. if the closing parenthesis is on the wrong line or is missing).</p>
<p>

  PRINTING:
    PostScript printing with different faces (an optimized set of faces is
    used if `vhdl-print-customize-faces' is non-nil) or colors (if
    `ps-print-color-p' is non-nil) is possible using the standard Emacs
    PostScript printing commands.  Option `vhdl-print-two-column' defines
    appropriate default settings for nice landscape two-column printing.
    The paper format can be set by option `ps-paper-type'.  Do not forget to
    switch `ps-print-color-p' to nil for printing on black-and-white
    printers.</p>
<p>

  OPTIONS:
    User options allow customization of VHDL Mode.  All options are
    accessible from the "Options" menu entry.  Simple options (switches
    and choices) can directly be changed, while for complex options a
    customization buffer is opened.  Changed options can be saved for future
    sessions using the "Save Options" menu entry.</p>
<p>
      Options and their detailed descriptions can also be accessed by using
    the "Customize" menu entry or the command `M-x customize-option' (`M-x
    customize-group' for groups).  Some customizations only take effect
    after some action (read the NOTE in the option documentation).
    Customization can also be done globally (i.e. site-wide, read the
    INSTALL file).</p>
<p>
      Not all options are described in this documentation, so go and see
    what other useful user options there are (`M-x vhdl-customize' or menu)!</p>
<p>

  FILE EXTENSIONS:
    As default, files with extensions ".vhd" and ".vhdl" are
    automatically recognized as VHDL source files.  To add an extension
    ".xxx", add the following line to your Emacs start-up file (`.emacs'):</p>
<p>
      (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.xxx\\'" . vhdl-mode) auto-mode-alist))</p>
<p>

  HINTS:
    - To start Emacs with open VHDL hierarchy browser without having to load
      a VHDL file first, use the command:</p>
<p>
        emacs -l vhdl-mode -f speedbar-frame-mode</p>
<p>
    - Type `C-g C-g' to interrupt long operations or if Emacs hangs.</p>
<p>
    - Some features only work on properly indented code.</p>

exists.  If NO-ASYNC is non-nil, call diff synchronously.</p>
<p>
When called interactively with a prefix argument, prompt
interactively for diff switches.  Otherwise, the switches
specified in `diff-switches' are passed to the diff command.</p>

<h3>Function: dired-get-filename</h3>
In Dired, return name of file mentioned on this line.
Value returned normally includes the directory name.
Optional arg LOCALP with value `no-dir' means don't include directory
name in result.  A value of `verbatim' means to return the name exactly as
it occurs in the buffer, and a value of t means construct name relative to
`default-directory', which still may contain slashes if in a subdirectory.
Optional arg NO-ERROR-IF-NOT-FILEP means treat `.' and `..' as
regular filenames and return nil if no filename on this line.
Otherwise, an error occurs in these cases.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional LOCALP NO-ERROR-IF-NOT-FILEP)<a name="window-make-atom"></a>
<h3>Function: window-make-atom</h3>
Make WINDOW an atomic window.
WINDOW must be an internal window.  Return WINDOW.<a name="dired-subdir-index"></a>

<h3>Function: isearch-resume</h3>
Resume an incremental search.
STRING is the string or regexp searched for.
REGEXP non-nil means the resumed search was a regexp search.
WORD non-nil means resume a word search.

window.<a name="kill-word"></a>
<h3>Function: kill-word</h3>
Kill characters forward until encountering the end of a word.
With argument ARG, do this that many times.<a name="find-auto-coding"></a>
<h3>Function: find-auto-coding</h3>
Find a coding system for a file FILENAME of which SIZE bytes follow point.
These bytes should include at least the first 1k of the file
and the last 3k of the file, but the middle may be omitted.</p>
<p>
The function checks FILENAME against the variable `auto-coding-alist'.
If FILENAME doesn't match any entries in the variable, it checks the
contents of the current buffer following point against
`auto-coding-regexp-alist'.  If no match is found, it checks for a
`coding:' tag in the first one or two lines following point.  If no
`coding:' tag is found, it checks any local variables list in the last
3K bytes out of the SIZE bytes.  Finally, if none of these methods
succeed, it checks to see if any function in `auto-coding-functions'
gives a match.</p>
<p>
If a coding system is specified, the return value is a cons
(CODING . SOURCE), where CODING is the specified coding system and
SOURCE is a symbol `auto-coding-alist', `auto-coding-regexp-alist',
`:coding', or `auto-coding-functions' indicating by what CODING is
specified.  Note that the validity of CODING is not checked;
it's the caller's responsibility to check it.</p>
<p>
If nothing is specified, the return value is nil.<a name="display-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: display-buffer</h3>
Display BUFFER-OR-NAME in some window, without selecting it.
BUFFER-OR-NAME must be a buffer or the name of an existing
buffer.  Return the window chosen for displaying BUFFER-OR-NAME,
or nil if no such window is found.</p>
<p>
Optional argument ACTION, if non-nil, should specify a display
action.  Its form is described below.</p>
<p>
Optional argument FRAME, if non-nil, acts like an additional
ALIST entry (reusable-frames . FRAME) to the action list of ACTION,
specifying the frame(s) to search for a window that is already
displaying the buffer.  See `display-buffer-reuse-window'</p>
<p>
If ACTION is non-nil, it should have the form (FUNCTION . ALIST),
where FUNCTION is either a function or a list of functions, and
ALIST is an arbitrary association list (alist).</p>
<p>
Each such FUNCTION should accept two arguments: the buffer to
display and an alist.  Based on those arguments, it should either
display the buffer and return the window, or return nil if unable
to display the buffer.</p>
<p>
The `display-buffer' function builds a function list and an alist
by combining the functions and alists specified in
`display-buffer-overriding-action', `display-buffer-alist', the
ACTION argument, `display-buffer-base-action', and
`display-buffer-fallback-action' (in order).  Then it calls each
function in the combined function list in turn, passing the
buffer as the first argument and the combined alist as the second
argument, until one of the functions returns non-nil.</p>
<p>
If ACTION is nil, the function list and the alist are built using
only the other variables mentioned above.</p>
<p>
Available action functions include:
 `display-buffer-same-window'
 `display-buffer-reuse-window'
 `display-buffer-pop-up-frame'
 `display-buffer-pop-up-window'
 `display-buffer-use-some-window'</p>
<p>
Recognized alist entries include:</p>
<p>
 `inhibit-same-window' -- A non-nil value prevents the same
                          window from being used for display.</p>
<p>
 `inhibit-switch-frame' -- A non-nil value prevents any other
                           frame from being raised or selected,
                           even if the window is displayed there.</p>
<p>
 `reusable-frames' -- Value specifies frame(s) to search for a
                      window that already displays the buffer.
                      See `display-buffer-reuse-window'.</p>
<p>
 `pop-up-frame-parameters' -- Value specifies an alist of frame
                              parameters to give a new frame, if
                              one is created.</p>
<p>
 `window-height' -- Value specifies either an integer (the number
    of lines of a new window), a floating point number (the
    fraction of a new window with respect to the height of the
    frame's root window) or a function to be called with one
    argument - a new window.  The function is supposed to adjust
    the height of the window; its return value is ignored.
    Suitable functions are `shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer'
    and `fit-window-to-buffer'.</p>
<p>
 `window-width' -- Value specifies either an integer (the number
    of columns of a new window), a floating point number (the
    fraction of a new window with respect to the width of the
    frame's root window) or a function to be called with one
    argument - a new window.  The function is supposed to adjust
    the width of the window; its return value is ignored.</p>
<p>
The ACTION argument to `display-buffer' can also have a non-nil
and non-list value.  This means to display the buffer in a window
other than the selected one, even if it is already displayed in
the selected window.  If called interactively with a prefix
argument, ACTION is t.<a name="daemonp"></a>
<h3>Function: daemonp</h3>
Return non-nil if the current emacs process is a daemon.
If the daemon was given a name argument, return that name.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="custom-magic-value-create"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-magic-value-create</h3>
Create compact status report for WIDGET.<a name="help-follow"></a>
<h3>Function: help-follow</h3>
Follow cross-reference at point.</p>
<p>
For the cross-reference format, see `help-make-xrefs'.<a name="Buffer-menu-delete-backwards"></a>
<h3>Function: Buffer-menu-delete-backwards</h3>
Mark the buffer on this Buffer Menu line for deletion, and move up.
A subsequent `x'
command will delete the marked buffer.  Prefix ARG means move
that many lines.<a name="url-dav-supported-p"></a>
<h3>Function: url-dav-supported-p</h3>
Return WebDAV protocol version supported by URL.
Returns nil if WebDAV is not supported.</p>
<p>
(fn URL)<a name="delete-backward-char"></a>
<h3>Function: delete-backward-char</h3>
Delete the previous N characters (following if N is negative).
If Transient Mark mode is enabled, the mark is active, and N is 1,
delete the text in the region and deactivate the mark instead.
To disable this, set `delete-active-region' to nil.</p>
<p>
Optional second arg KILLFLAG, if non-nil, means to kill (save in
kill ring) instead of delete.  Interactively, N is the prefix
arg, and KILLFLAG is set if N is explicitly specified.</p>
<p>
In Overwrite mode, single character backward deletion may replace
tabs with spaces so as to back over columns, unless point is at
the end of the line.<a name="remove-list-of-text-properties"></a>
<h3>Function: remove-list-of-text-properties</h3>
Remove some properties from text from START to END.
The third argument LIST-OF-PROPERTIES is a list of property names to remove.
If the optional fourth argument OBJECT is a buffer (or nil, which means
the current buffer), START and END are buffer positions (integers or
markers).  If OBJECT is a string, START and END are 0-based indices into it.
Return t if any property was actually removed, nil otherwise.</p>
<p>
(fn START END LIST-OF-PROPERTIES &optional OBJECT)<a name="custom-face-state-set-and-redraw"></a>
<h3>Function: custom-face-state-set-and-redraw</h3>
Set state of face widget WIDGET and redraw with current settings.<a name="autoload-find-destination"></a>
<h3>Function: autoload-find-destination</h3>
Find the destination point of the current buffer's autoloads.
FILE is the file name of the current buffer.
Returns a buffer whose point is placed at the requested location.
Returns nil if the file's autoloads are uptodate, otherwise
removes any prior now out-of-date autoload entries.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE LOAD-NAME)<a name="byte-optimize-all-constp"></a>
<h3>Function: byte-optimize-all-constp</h3>
Non-nil if all elements of LIST satisfy `macroexp-const-p</p>
<p>
(fn LIST)<a name="make-random-state"></a>
<h3>Function: make-random-state</h3>
Return a copy of random-state STATE, or of the internal state if omitted.
If STATE is t, return a new state object seeded from the time of day.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional STATE)<a name="menu-bar-kill-ring-save"></a>
<h3>Function: menu-bar-kill-ring-save</h3>
Save the region as if killed, but don't kill it.
In Transient Mark mode, deactivate the mark.
If `interprogram-cut-function' is non-nil, also save the text for a window
system cut and paste.</p>
<p>
If you want to append the killed line to the last killed text,
use C-M-w before M-w.</p>
<p>
This command is similar to `copy-region-as-kill', except that it gives
visual feedback indicating the extent of the region being copied.<a name="previous-error-no-select"></a>
<h3>Function: previous-error-no-select</h3>
Move point to the previous error in the `next-error' buffer and highlight match.
Prefix arg N says how many error messages to move backwards (or
forwards, if negative).
Finds and highlights the source line like M-g p, but does not
select the source buffer.<a name="slitex-mode"></a>
<h3>Function: slitex-mode</h3>
Major mode for editing files of input for SliTeX.
Makes $ and } display the characters they match.
Makes " insert `` when it seems to be the beginning of a quotation,
and '' when it appears to be the end; it inserts " only after a \.</p>
<p>
Use M-x tex-region to run SliTeX on the current region, plus the preamble
copied from the top of the file (containing \documentstyle, etc.),
running SliTeX under a special subshell.  M-x tex-buffer does the whole buffer.
M-x tex-file saves the buffer and then processes the file.
M-x tex-print prints the .dvi file made by any of these.
M-x tex-view previews the .dvi file made by any of these.
M-x tex-bibtex-file runs bibtex on the file of the current buffer.</p>
<p>
Use M-x tex-validate-buffer to check buffer for paragraphs containing
mismatched $'s or braces.</p>
<p>
Special commands:</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `slitex-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

Mode variables:
slitex-run-command
	Command string used by M-x tex-region or M-x tex-buffer.
tex-directory
	Directory in which to create temporary files for SliTeX jobs
	run by M-x tex-region or M-x tex-buffer.
tex-dvi-print-command
	Command string used by M-x tex-print to print a .dvi file.
tex-alt-dvi-print-command
	Alternative command string used by M-x tex-print (when given a prefix
	argument) to print a .dvi file.
tex-dvi-view-command
	Command string used by M-x tex-view to preview a .dvi file.
tex-show-queue-command
	Command string used by M-x tex-show-print-queue to show the print
	queue that M-x tex-print put your job on.</p>
<p>
Entering SliTeX mode runs the hook `text-mode-hook', then the hook
`tex-mode-hook', then the hook `latex-mode-hook', and finally the hook
`slitex-mode-hook'.  When the special subshell is initiated, the hook
`tex-shell-hook' is run.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="match-string-no-properties"></a>
<h3>Function: match-string-no-properties</h3>
Return string of text matched by last search, without text properties.
NUM specifies which parenthesized expression in the last regexp.
 Value is nil if NUMth pair didn't match, or there were less than NUM pairs.
Zero means the entire text matched by the whole regexp or whole string.
STRING should be given if the last search was by `string-match' on STRING.
If STRING is nil, the current buffer should be the same buffer
the search/match was performed in.<a name="process-exit-status"></a>
<h3>Function: process-exit-status</h3>
Return the exit status of PROCESS or the signal number that killed it.
If PROCESS has not yet exited or died, return 0.</p>
<p>
(fn PROCESS)<a name="bool-vector-p"></a>
<h3>Function: bool-vector-p</h3>
Return t if OBJECT is a bool-vector.</p>

(fn OBJECT)<a name="lookup-key"></a>
<h3>Function: lookup-key</h3>
In keymap KEYMAP, look up key sequence KEY.  Return the definition.
A value of nil means undefined.  See doc of `define-key'
for kinds of definitions.</p>
<p>
A number as value means KEY is "too long";
that is, characters or symbols in it except for the last one
fail to be a valid sequence of prefix characters in KEYMAP.
The number is how many characters at the front of KEY
it takes to reach a non-prefix key.</p>
<p>
Normally, `lookup-key' ignores bindings for t, which act as default
bindings, used when nothing else in the keymap applies; this makes it
usable as a general function for probing keymaps.  However, if the
third optional argument ACCEPT-DEFAULT is non-nil, `lookup-key' will
recognize the default bindings, just as `read-key-sequence' does.</p>
<p>
(fn KEYMAP KEY &optional ACCEPT-DEFAULT)<a name="ispell-get-line"></a>
<h3>Function: ispell-get-line</h3>
Grab the next line of data.
Returns a string with the line data.<a name="slot-boundp"></a>
<h3>Function: slot-boundp</h3>
Return non-nil if OBJECT's SLOT is bound.
Setting a slot's value makes it bound.  Calling `slot-makeunbound' will
make a slot unbound.
OBJECT can be an instance or a class.<a name="Info-directory-find-node"></a>
<h3>Function: Info-directory-find-node</h3>
Directory-specific implementation of `Info-find-node-2'.<a name="x-dnd-handle-moz-url"></a>
<h3>Function: x-dnd-handle-moz-url</h3>
Handle one item of type text/x-moz-url.
WINDOW is the window where the drop happened.  ACTION is ignored.
DATA is the moz-url, which is formatted as two strings separated by \r\n.
The first string is the URL, the second string is the title of that URL.
DATA is encoded in utf-16.  Decode the URL and call `x-dnd-handle-uri-list'.<a name="font-lock-match-c-style-declaration-item-and-skip-to-next"></a>
<h3>Function: font-lock-match-c-style-declaration-item-and-skip-to-next</h3>
Match, and move over, any declaration/definition item after point.
Matches after point, but ignores leading whitespace and `*' characters.
Does not move further than LIMIT.</p>
<p>
The expected syntax of a declaration/definition item is `word' (preceded by
optional whitespace and `*' characters and proceeded by optional whitespace)
optionally followed by a `('.  Everything following the item (but belonging to
it) is expected to be skip-able by `scan-sexps', and items are expected to be
separated with a `,' and to be terminated with a `;'.</p>
<p>
Thus the regexp matches after point:	word (
					^^^^ ^
Where the match subexpressions are:	  1  2</p>
<p>
The item is delimited by (match-beginning 1) and (match-end 1).
If (match-beginning 2) is non-nil, the item is followed by a `('.</p>
<p>
This function could be MATCHER in a MATCH-ANCHORED `font-lock-keywords' item.<a name="timeclock-out"></a>
<h3>Function: timeclock-out</h3>
Clock out, recording the current time moment in the timelog.
If a prefix ARG is given, the user has completed the project that was
begun during the last time segment.</p>
<p>
REASON is the user's reason for clocking out.  If REASON is nil, and
FIND-REASON is non-nil -- or the user calls `timeclock-out'
interactively -- call the function `timeclock-get-reason-function' to
discover the reason.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG REASON FIND-REASON)<a name="help-buffer"></a>
<h3>Function: help-buffer</h3>
Return the name of a buffer for inserting help.
If `help-xref-following' is non-nil, this is the name of the
current buffer.  Signal an error if this buffer is not derived
from `help-mode'.
Otherwise, return "*Help*", creating a buffer with that name if
it does not already exist.<a name="make-frame"></a>
<h3>Function: make-frame</h3>
Return a newly created frame displaying the current buffer.
Optional argument PARAMETERS is an alist of frame parameters for
the new frame.  Each element of PARAMETERS should have the
form (NAME . VALUE), for example:</p>
<p>
 (name . STRING)	The frame should be named STRING.</p>
<p>
 (width . NUMBER)	The frame should be NUMBER characters in width.
 (height . NUMBER)	The frame should be NUMBER text lines high.</p>
<p>
You cannot specify either `width' or `height', you must specify
neither or both.</p>
<p>
 (minibuffer . t)	The frame should have a minibuffer.
 (minibuffer . nil)	The frame should have no minibuffer.
 (minibuffer . only)	The frame should contain only a minibuffer.
 (minibuffer . WINDOW)	The frame should use WINDOW as its minibuffer window.</p>
<p>
 (window-system . nil)	The frame should be displayed on a terminal device.
 (window-system . x)	The frame should be displayed in an X window.</p>
<p>
 (display . ":0")     The frame should appear on display :0.</p>
<p>
 (terminal . TERMINAL)  The frame should use the terminal object TERMINAL.</p>
<p>
In addition, any parameter specified in `default-frame-alist',
but not present in PARAMETERS, is applied.</p>
<p>
Before creating the frame (via `frame-creation-function-alist'),
this function runs the hook `before-make-frame-hook'.  After
creating the frame, it runs the hook `after-make-frame-functions'
with one arg, the newly created frame.</p>
<p>
If a display parameter is supplied and a window-system is not,
guess the window-system from the display.</p>
<p>
On graphical displays, this function does not itself make the new
frame the selected frame.  However, the window system may select
the new frame according to its own rules.<a name="x-display-pixel-height"></a>
<h3>Function: x-display-pixel-height</h3>
Return the height in pixels of the X display TERMINAL.
The optional argument TERMINAL specifies which display to ask about.
TERMINAL should be a terminal object, a frame or a display name (a string).
If omitted or nil, that stands for the selected frame's display.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional TERMINAL)<a name="category-table"></a>
<h3>Function: category-table</h3>
Return the current category table.
This is the one specified by the current buffer.</p>
<p>
(fn)<a name="comint-redirect-filter"></a>
<h3>Function: comint-redirect-filter</h3>
Filter function which redirects output from PROCESS to a buffer or buffers.
The variable `comint-redirect-output-buffer' says which buffer(s) to
place output in.</p>
<p>
INPUT-STRING is the input from the Comint process.</p>
<p>
This function runs as a process filter, and does not need to be invoked by the
end user.</p>
<p>
(fn PROCESS INPUT-STRING)<a name="cddar"></a>
<h3>Function: cddar</h3>
Return the `cdr' of the `cdr' of the `car' of X.</p>
<p>
(fn X)<a name="center-region"></a>
<h3>Function: center-region</h3>
Center each nonblank line starting in the region.
See `center-line' for more info.<a name="table-insert-sequence"></a>
<h3>Function: table-insert-sequence</h3>
Travel cells forward while inserting a specified sequence string in each cell.
STR is the base string from which the sequence starts.  When STR is an
empty string then each cell content is erased.  When STR ends with
numerical characters (they may optionally be surrounded by a pair of
parentheses) they are incremented as a decimal number.  Otherwise the
last character in STR is incremented in ASCII code order.  N is the
number of sequence elements to insert.  When N is negative the cell
traveling direction is backward.  When N is zero it travels forward
entire table.  INCREMENT is the increment between adjacent sequence
elements and can be a negative number for effectively decrementing.
INTERVAL is the number of cells to travel between sequence element
insertion which is normally 1.  When zero or less is given for
INTERVAL it is interpreted as number of cells per row so that sequence
is placed straight down vertically as long as the table's cell
structure is uniform.  JUSTIFY is one of the symbol 'left, 'center or
'right, that specifies justification of the inserted string.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<p>
  (progn
    (table-insert 16 3 5 1)
    (table-forward-cell 15)
    (table-insert-sequence "D0" -16 1 1 'center)
    (table-forward-cell 16)
    (table-insert-sequence "A[0]" -16 1 1 'center)
    (table-forward-cell 1)
    (table-insert-sequence "-" 16 0 1 'center))</p>
<p>
  (progn
    (table-insert 16 8 5 1)
    (table-insert-sequence "@" 0 1 2 'right)
    (table-forward-cell 1)
    (table-insert-sequence "64" 0 1 2 'left))</p>

<h3>Function: ad-add-advice</h3>
Add a piece of ADVICE to FUNCTION's list of advices in CLASS.</p>
<p>
ADVICE has the form (NAME PROTECTED ENABLED DEFINITION), where
NAME is the advice name; PROTECTED is a flag specifying whether
to protect against non-local exits; ENABLED is a flag specifying
whether to initially enable the advice; and DEFINITION has the
form (advice . LAMBDA), where LAMBDA is a lambda expression.</p>
<p>
If FUNCTION already has a piece of advice with the same name,
then POSITION is ignored, and the old advice is overwritten with
the new one.</p>
<p>
If FUNCTION already has one or more pieces of advice of the

(fn FORM)<a name="ad-activate"></a>
<h3>Function: ad-activate</h3>
Activate all the advice information of an advised FUNCTION.
If FUNCTION has a proper original definition then an advised
definition will be generated from FUNCTION's advice info and the
definition of FUNCTION will be replaced with it.  If a previously
cached advised definition was available, it will be used.
The optional COMPILE argument determines whether the resulting function
or a compilable cached definition will be compiled.  If it is negative
no compilation will be performed, if it is positive or otherwise non-nil
the resulting function will be compiled, if it is nil the behavior depends
on the value of `ad-default-compilation-action' (which see).
Activation of an advised function that has an advice info but no actual
pieces of advice is equivalent to a call to `ad-unadvise'.  Activation of
an advised function that has actual pieces of advice but none of them are
enabled is equivalent to a call to `ad-deactivate'.  The current advised
definition will always be cached for later usage.</p>

If FRAME is omitted or nil the value describes the default attributes,
but if you specify FRAME, the value describes the attributes
of FACE on FRAME.<a name="format-time-string"></a>
<h3>Function: format-time-string</h3>
Use FORMAT-STRING to format the time TIME, or now if omitted.
TIME is specified as (HIGH LOW USEC PSEC), as returned by
`current-time' or `file-attributes'.  The obsolete form (HIGH . LOW)
is also still accepted.
The third, optional, argument UNIVERSAL, if non-nil, means describe TIME
as Universal Time; nil means describe TIME in the local time zone.
The value is a copy of FORMAT-STRING, but with certain constructs replaced
by text that describes the specified date and time in TIME:</p>
<p>
%Y is the year, %y within the century, %C the century.
%G is the year corresponding to the ISO week, %g within the century.
%m is the numeric month.
%b and %h are the locale's abbreviated month name, %B the full name.
%d is the day of the month, zero-padded, %e is blank-padded.
%u is the numeric day of week from 1 (Monday) to 7, %w from 0 (Sunday) to 6.
%a is the locale's abbreviated name of the day of week, %A the full name.
%U is the week number starting on Sunday, %W starting on Monday,
 %V according to ISO 8601.
%j is the day of the year.</p>
<p>
%H is the hour on a 24-hour clock, %I is on a 12-hour clock, %k is like %H
 only blank-padded, %l is like %I blank-padded.
%p is the locale's equivalent of either AM or PM.
%M is the minute.
%S is the second.
%N is the nanosecond, %6N the microsecond, %3N the millisecond, etc.
%Z is the time zone name, %z is the numeric form.
%s is the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000.</p>
<p>
%c is the locale's date and time format.
%x is the locale's "preferred" date format.
%D is like "%m/%d/%y".</p>
<p>
%R is like "%H:%M", %T is like "%H:%M:%S", %r is like "%I:%M:%S %p".
%X is the locale's "preferred" time format.</p>
<p>
Finally, %n is a newline, %t is a tab, %% is a literal %.</p>
<p>
Certain flags and modifiers are available with some format controls.
The flags are `_', `-', `^' and `#'.  For certain characters X,
%_X is like %X, but padded with blanks; %-X is like %X,
but without padding.  %^X is like %X, but with all textual
characters up-cased; %#X is like %X, but with letter-case of
all textual characters reversed.
%NX (where N stands for an integer) is like %X,
but takes up at least N (a number) positions.
The modifiers are `E' and `O'.  For certain characters X,
%EX is a locale's alternative version of %X;
%OX is like %X, but uses the locale's number symbols.</p>
<p>
For example, to produce full ISO 8601 format, use "%Y-%m-%dT%T%z".</p>

<h3>Function: sql-add-product-keywords</h3>
Add highlighting KEYWORDS for SQL PRODUCT.</p>
<p>
PRODUCT should be a symbol, the name of a SQL product, such as
`oracle'.  KEYWORDS should be a list; see the variable
`font-lock-keywords'.  By default they are added at the beginning
of the current highlighting list.  If optional argument APPEND is
`set', they are used to replace the current highlighting list.
If APPEND is any other non-nil value, they are added at the end
of the current highlighting list.</p>
<p>
For example:</p>
<p>
 (sql-add-product-keywords 'ms
  '(("\\b\\w+_t\\b" . font-lock-type-face)))</p>

This is a skeleton command (see `skeleton-insert').
Normally the skeleton text is inserted at point, with nothing "inside".
If there is a highlighted region, the skeleton text is wrapped
around the region text.</p>
<p>
A prefix argument ARG says to wrap the skeleton around the next ARG words.
A prefix argument of -1 says to wrap around region, even if not highlighted.
A prefix argument of zero says to wrap around zero words---that is, nothing.
This is a way of overriding the use of a highlighted region.<a name="eieio-default-eval-maybe"></a>
