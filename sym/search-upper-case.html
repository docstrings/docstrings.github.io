<h3>Variable: search-upper-case</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, upper case chars disable case fold searching.<br>
That is, upper and lower case chars must match exactly.<br>
This applies no matter where the chars come from, but does not<br>
apply to chars in regexps that are prefixed with `\'.<br>
If this value is `not-yanks', text yanked into the search string<br>
in Isearch mode is always downcased.</p>
