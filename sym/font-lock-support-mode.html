<h3>Variable: font-lock-support-mode</h3>
<p>
Support mode for Font Lock mode.
Support modes speed up Font Lock mode by being choosy about when fontification
occurs.  The default support mode, Just-in-time Lock mode (symbol
`jit-lock-mode'), is recommended.</p>
<p>
Other, older support modes are Fast Lock mode (symbol `fast-lock-mode') and
Lazy Lock mode (symbol `lazy-lock-mode').  See those modes for more info.
However, they are no longer recommended, as Just-in-time Lock mode is better.</p>
<p>
If nil, means support for Font Lock mode is never performed.
If a symbol, use that support mode.
If a list, each element should be of the form (MAJOR-MODE . SUPPORT-MODE),
where MAJOR-MODE is a symbol or t (meaning the default).  For example:
 ((c-mode . fast-lock-mode) (c++-mode . fast-lock-mode) (t . lazy-lock-mode))
means that Fast Lock mode is used to support Font Lock mode for buffers in C or
C++ modes, and Lazy Lock mode is used to support Font Lock mode otherwise.</p>
<p>
The value of this variable is used when Font Lock mode is turned on.</p>
