<h3>Function: display-buffer-use-some-window</h3>
<p>
Display BUFFER in an existing window.
Search for a usable window, set that window to the buffer, and
return the window.  If no suitable window is found, return nil.</p>
<p>
If ALIST has a non-nil `inhibit-switch-frame' entry, then in the
event that a window in another frame is chosen, avoid raising
that frame.</p>
