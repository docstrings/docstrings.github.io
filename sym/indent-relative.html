<h3>Function: indent-relative</h3>
<p>
Space out to under next indent point in previous nonblank line.<br>
An indent point is a non-whitespace character following whitespace.<br>
The following line shows the indentation points in this line.<br>
    ^         ^    ^     ^   ^           ^      ^  ^    ^<br>
If the previous nonblank line has no indent points beyond the<br>
column point starts at, `tab-to-tab-stop' is done instead, unless<br>
this command is invoked with a numeric argument, in which case it<br>
does nothing.<br>
<br>
