<h3>Function: indent-relative</h3>
<p>
Space out to under next indent point in previous nonblank line.
An indent point is a non-whitespace character following whitespace.
The following line shows the indentation points in this line.
    ^         ^    ^     ^   ^           ^      ^  ^    ^
If the previous nonblank line has no indent points beyond the
column point starts at, `tab-to-tab-stop' is done instead, unless
this command is invoked with a numeric argument, in which case it
does nothing.</p>
