<h3>Function: change-log-merge</h3>
<p>
Merge the contents of change log file OTHER-LOG with this buffer.<br>
Both must be found in Change Log mode (since the merging depends on<br>
the appropriate motion commands).  OTHER-LOG can be either a file name<br>
or a buffer.<br>
<br>
Entries are inserted in chronological order.  Both the current and<br>
old-style time formats for entries are supported.
