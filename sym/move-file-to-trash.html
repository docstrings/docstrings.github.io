<h3>Function: move-file-to-trash</h3>
<p>
Move the file (or directory) named FILENAME to the trash.
When `delete-by-moving-to-trash' is non-nil, this function is
called by `delete-file' and `delete-directory' instead of
deleting files outright.</p>
<p>
If the function `system-move-file-to-trash' is defined, call it
 with FILENAME as an argument.
Otherwise, if `trash-directory' is non-nil, move FILENAME to that
 directory.
Otherwise, trash FILENAME using the freedesktop.org conventions,
 like the GNOME, KDE and XFCE desktop environments.  Emacs only
 moves files to "home trash", ignoring per-volume trashcans.</p>
