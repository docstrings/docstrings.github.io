FUNCTION is a symbol; FILE is a file name string to pass to `load'.<br>
Third arg DOCSTRING is documentation for the function.<br>
Fourth arg INTERACTIVE if non-nil says function can be called interactively.<br>
Fifth arg TYPE indicates the type of the object:<br>
   nil or omitted says FUNCTION is a function,<br>
   `keymap' says FUNCTION is really a keymap, and<br>
   `macro' or t says FUNCTION is really a macro.<br>
