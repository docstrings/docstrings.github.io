<h3>Variable: jka-compr-mode-alist-additions</h3>
<p>
List of pairs added to `auto-mode-alist' when installing jka-compr.
Uninstalling jka-compr removes all pairs from `auto-mode-alist' that
installing added.</p>
<p>
If you set this outside Custom while Auto Compression mode is
already enabled (as it is by default), you have to call
`jka-compr-update' after setting it to properly update other
variables.  Setting this through Custom does that automatically.</p>
