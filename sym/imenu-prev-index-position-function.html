<h3>Variable: imenu-prev-index-position-function</h3>
<p>
Function for finding the next index position.</p>
<p>
If `imenu-create-index-function' is set to
`imenu-default-create-index-function', then you must set this variable
to a function that will find the next index, looking backwards in the
file.</p>
<p>
The function should leave point at the place to be connected to the
index and it should return nil when it doesn't find another index.</p>
