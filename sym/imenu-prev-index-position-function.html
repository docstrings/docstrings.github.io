<h3>Variable: imenu-prev-index-position-function</h3>
<p>
Function for finding the next index position.<br>
<br>
If `imenu-create-index-function' is set to<br>
`imenu-default-create-index-function', then you must set this variable<br>
to a function that will find the next index, looking backwards in the<br>
file.<br>
<br>
The function should leave point at the place to be connected to the<br>
index and it should return nil when it doesn't find another index.</p>
