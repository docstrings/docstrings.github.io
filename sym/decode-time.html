<h3>Function: decode-time</h3>
<p>
Decode a time value as (SEC MINUTE HOUR DAY MONTH YEAR DOW DST ZONE).
The optional SPECIFIED-TIME should be a list of (HIGH LOW . IGNORED),
as from `current-time' and `file-attributes', or nil to use the
current time.  The obsolete form (HIGH . LOW) is also still accepted.
The list has the following nine members: SEC is an integer between 0
and 60; SEC is 60 for a leap second, which only some operating systems
support.  MINUTE is an integer between 0 and 59.  HOUR is an integer
between 0 and 23.  DAY is an integer between 1 and 31.  MONTH is an
integer between 1 and 12.  YEAR is an integer indicating the
four-digit year.  DOW is the day of week, an integer between 0 and 6,
where 0 is Sunday.  DST is t if daylight saving time is in effect,
otherwise nil.  ZONE is an integer indicating the number of seconds
east of Greenwich.  (Note that Common Lisp has different meanings for
DOW and ZONE.)</p>
