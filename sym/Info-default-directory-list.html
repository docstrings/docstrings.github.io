<h3>Variable: Info-default-directory-list</h3>
<p>
Default list of directories to search for Info documentation files.<br>
They are searched in the order they are given in the list.<br>
Therefore, the directory of Info files that come with Emacs<br>
normally should come last (so that local files override standard ones),<br>
unless Emacs is installed into a non-standard directory.  In the latter<br>
case, the directory of Info files that come with Emacs should be<br>
first in this list.<br>
<br>
Once Info is started, the list of directories to search<br>
comes from the variable `Info-directory-list'.<br>
This variable `Info-default-directory-list' is used as the default<br>
for initializing `Info-directory-list' when Info is started, unless<br>
the environment variable INFOPATH is set.<br>
<br>
Although this is a customizable variable, that is mainly for technical<br>
reasons.  Normally, you should either set INFOPATH or customize<br>
`Info-additional-directory-list', rather than changing this variable.</p>
