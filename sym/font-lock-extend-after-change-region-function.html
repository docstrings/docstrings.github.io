<h3>Variable: font-lock-extend-after-change-region-function</h3>
<p>
A function that determines the region to refontify after a change.<br>
<br>
This variable is either nil, or is a function that determines the<br>
region to refontify after a change.<br>
It is usually set by the major mode via `font-lock-defaults'.<br>
Font-lock calls this function after each buffer change.<br>
<br>
The function is given three parameters, the standard BEG, END, and OLD-LEN<br>
from `after-change-functions'.  It should return either a cons of the beginning<br>
and end buffer positions (in that order) of the region to refontify, or nil<br>
(which directs the caller to fontify a default region).<br>
This function should preserve the match-data.<br>
The region it returns may start or end in the middle of a line.</p>
