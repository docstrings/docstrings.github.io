<h3>Function: highlight-compare-with-file</h3>
<p>
Compare this buffer with a file, and highlight differences.</p>
<p>
If the buffer has a backup filename, it is used as the default when
this function is called interactively.</p>
<p>
If the current buffer is visiting the file being compared against, it
also will have its differences highlighted.  Otherwise, the file is
read in temporarily but the buffer is deleted.</p>
<p>
If the buffer is read-only, differences will be highlighted but no property
changes are made, so M-x highlight-changes-next-change and
M-x highlight-changes-previous-change will not work.</p>
<p>
