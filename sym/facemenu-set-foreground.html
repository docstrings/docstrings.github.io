<h3>Function: facemenu-set-foreground</h3>
<p>
Set the foreground COLOR of the region or next character typed.
This command reads the color in the minibuffer.</p>
<p>
If the region is active (normally true except in Transient Mark mode)
and there is no prefix argument, this command sets the region to the
requested face.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, this command specifies the face for the next character
inserted.  Moving point or switching buffers before
typing a character to insert cancels the specification.</p>
