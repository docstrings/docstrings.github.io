<h3>Variable: cl-least-positive-normalized-float</h3>
<p>
The smallest normalized Lisp float greater than zero.
This is the smallest value for which IEEE denormalization does not lose
precision.  For IEEE machines, this value is about 2.22e-308.
For machines that do not support the concept of denormalization
and gradual underflow, this constant equals `cl-least-positive-float'.
Call `cl-float-limits' to set this.</p>
