<h3>Variable: dynamic-library-alist</h3>
<p>
Alist of dynamic libraries vs external files implementing them.
Each element is a list (LIBRARY FILE...), where the car is a symbol
representing a supported external library, and the rest are strings giving
alternate filenames for that library.</p>
<p>
Emacs tries to load the library from the files in the order they appear on
the list; if none is loaded, the running session of Emacs won't have access
to that library.</p>
<p>
Note that image types `pbm' and `xbm' do not need entries in this variable
because they do not depend on external libraries and are always available.</p>
<p>
Also note that this is not a generic facility for accessing external
libraries; only those already known by Emacs will be loaded.</p>
