<h3>Function: comment-dwim</h3>
<p>
Call the comment command you want (Do What I Mean).<br>
If the region is active and `transient-mark-mode' is on, call<br>
`comment-region' (unless it only consists of comments, in which<br>
case it calls `uncomment-region').<br>
Else, if the current line is empty, call `comment-insert-comment-function'<br>
if it is defined, otherwise insert a comment and indent it.<br>
Else if a prefix ARG is specified, call `comment-kill'.<br>
Else, call `comment-indent'.<br>
You can configure `comment-style' to change the way regions are commented.
