<h3>Function: file-relative-name</h3>
<p>
Convert FILENAME to be relative to DIRECTORY (default: `default-directory').
This function returns a relative file name which is equivalent to FILENAME
when used with that default directory as the default.
If FILENAME and DIRECTORY lie on different machines or on different drives
on a DOS/Windows machine, it returns FILENAME in expanded form.</p>
