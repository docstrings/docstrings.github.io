<h3>Variable: syntax-propertize-extend-region-functions</h3>
<p>
Special hook run just before proceeding to propertize a region.<br>
This is used to allow major modes to help `syntax-propertize' find safe buffer<br>
positions as beginning and end of the propertized region.  Its most common use<br>
is to solve the problem of /identification/ of multiline elements by providing<br>
a function that tries to find such elements and move the boundaries such that<br>
they do not fall in the middle of one.<br>
Each function is called with two arguments (START and END) and it should return<br>
either a cons (NEW-START . NEW-END) or nil if no adjustment should be made.<br>
These functions are run in turn repeatedly until they all return nil.<br>
Put first the functions more likely to cause a change and cheaper to compute.</p>
