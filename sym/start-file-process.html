<h3>Function: start-file-process</h3>
<p>
Start a program in a subprocess.  Return the process object for it.<br>
<br>
Similar to `start-process', but may invoke a file handler based on<br>
`default-directory'.  See Info node `(elisp)Magic File Names'.<br>
<br>
This handler ought to run PROGRAM, perhaps on the local host,<br>
perhaps on a remote host that corresponds to `default-directory'.<br>
In the latter case, the local part of `default-directory' becomes<br>
the working directory of the process.<br>
<br>
PROGRAM and PROGRAM-ARGS might be file names.  They are not<br>
objects of file handler invocation.  File handlers might not
support pty association, if PROGRAM is nil.</p>
