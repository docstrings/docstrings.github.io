<h3>Function: skeleton-insert</h3>
<p>
Insert the complex statement skeleton SKELETON describes very concisely.</p>
<p>
With optional second argument REGIONS, wrap first interesting point
(`_') in skeleton around next REGIONS words, if REGIONS is positive.
If REGIONS is negative, wrap REGIONS preceding interregions into first
REGIONS interesting positions (successive `_'s) in skeleton.</p>
<p>
An interregion is the stretch of text between two contiguous marked
points.  If you marked A B C [] (where [] is the cursor) in
alphabetical order, the 3 interregions are simply the last 3 regions.
But if you marked B A [] C, the interregions are B-A, A-[], []-C.</p>
<p>
The optional third argument STR, if specified, is the value for the
variable `str' within the skeleton.  When this is non-nil, the
interactor gets ignored, and this should be a valid skeleton element.</p>
<p>
SKELETON is made up as (INTERACTOR ELEMENT ...).  INTERACTOR may be nil if
not needed, a prompt-string or an expression for complex read functions.</p>
<p>
If ELEMENT is a string or a character it gets inserted (see also
`skeleton-transformation-function').  Other possibilities are:</p>
<p>
	\n	go to next line and indent according to mode
	_	interesting point, interregion here
	-	interesting point, no interregion interaction, overrides
		interesting point set by _
	>	indent line (or interregion if > _) according to major mode
	@	add position to `skeleton-positions'
	&	do next ELEMENT if previous moved point
	|	do next ELEMENT if previous didn't move point
	-num	delete num preceding characters (see `skeleton-untabify')
	resume:	skipped, continue here if quit is signaled
	nil	skipped</p>
<p>
After termination, point will be positioned at the last occurrence of -
or at the first occurrence of _ or at the end of the inserted text.</p>
<p>
Further elements can be defined via `skeleton-further-elements'.  ELEMENT may
itself be a SKELETON with an INTERACTOR.  The user is prompted repeatedly for
different inputs.  The SKELETON is processed as often as the user enters a
non-empty string.  C-g terminates skeleton insertion, but
continues after `resume:' and positions at `_' if any.  If INTERACTOR in such
a subskeleton is a prompt-string which contains a ".. %s .." it is
formatted with `skeleton-subprompt'.  Such an INTERACTOR may also be a list of
strings with the subskeleton being repeated once for each string.</p>
<p>
Quoted Lisp expressions are evaluated for their side-effects.
Other Lisp expressions are evaluated and the value treated as above.
Note that expressions may not return t since this implies an
endless loop.  Modes can define other symbols by locally setting them
to any valid skeleton element.  The following local variables are
available:</p>
<p>
	str	first time: read a string according to INTERACTOR
		then: insert previously read string once more
	help	help-form during interaction with the user or nil
	input	initial input (string or cons with index) while reading str
	v1, v2	local variables for memorizing anything you want</p>
<p>
When done with skeleton, but before going back to `_'-point call
`skeleton-end-hook' if that is non-nil.</p>
