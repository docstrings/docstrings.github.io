<h3>Variable: print-number-table</h3>
<p>
A vector used internally to produce `#N=' labels and `#N#' references.
The Lisp printer uses this vector to detect Lisp objects referenced more
than once.</p>
<p>
When you bind `print-continuous-numbering' to t, you should probably
also bind `print-number-table' to nil.  This ensures that the value of
`print-number-table' can be garbage-collected once the printing is
done.  If all elements of `print-number-table' are nil, it means that
the printing done so far has not found any shared structure or objects
that need to be recorded in the table.</p>
