<h3>Function: get-next-valid-buffer</h3>
<p>
Search LIST for a valid buffer to display in FRAME.
Return nil when all buffers in LIST are undesirable for display,
otherwise return the first suitable buffer in LIST.</p>
<p>
Buffers not visible in windows are preferred to visible buffers,
unless VISIBLE-OK is non-nil.
If the optional argument FRAME is nil, it defaults to the selected frame.
If BUFFER is non-nil, ignore occurrences of that buffer in LIST.</p>
