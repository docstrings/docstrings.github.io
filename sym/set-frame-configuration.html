<h3>Function: set-frame-configuration</h3>
<p>
Restore the frames to the state described by CONFIGURATION.
Each frame listed in CONFIGURATION has its position, size, window
configuration, and other parameters set as specified in CONFIGURATION.
However, this function does not restore deleted frames.</p>
<p>
Ordinarily, this function deletes all existing frames not
listed in CONFIGURATION.  But if optional second argument NODELETE
is given and non-nil, the unwanted frames are iconified instead.</p>
