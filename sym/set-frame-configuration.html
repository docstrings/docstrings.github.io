<h3>Function: set-frame-configuration</h3>
<p>
Restore the frames to the state described by CONFIGURATION.<br>
Each frame listed in CONFIGURATION has its position, size, window<br>
configuration, and other parameters set as specified in CONFIGURATION.<br>
However, this function does not restore deleted frames.<br>
<br>
Ordinarily, this function deletes all existing frames not<br>
listed in CONFIGURATION.  But if optional second argument NODELETE<br>
is given and non-nil, the unwanted frames are iconified instead.</p>
