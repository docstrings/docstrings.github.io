<h3>Function: dabbrev--find-expansion</h3>
<p>
Find one occurrence of ABBREV, and return the expansion.<br>
DIRECTION > 0 means look that many times backwards.<br>
DIRECTION < 0 means look that many times forward.<br>
DIRECTION = 0 means try both backward and forward.<br>
IGNORE-CASE non-nil means ignore case when searching.<br>
This sets `dabbrev--last-direction' to 1 or -1 according<br>
to the direction in which the occurrence was actually found.<br>
It sets `dabbrev--last-expansion-location' to the location<br>
of the start of the occurrence.<br>
