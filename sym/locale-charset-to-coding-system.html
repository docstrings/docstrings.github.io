<h3>Function: locale-charset-to-coding-system</h3>
<p>
Find coding system corresponding to CHARSET.
CHARSET is any sort of non-Emacs charset name, such as might be used
in a locale codeset, or elsewhere.  It is matched to a coding system
first by case-insensitive lookup in `locale-charset-alist'.  Then
matches are looked for in the coding system list, treating case and
the characters `-' and `_' as insignificant.  The coding system base
is returned.  Thus, for instance, if charset "ISO8859-2",
`iso-latin-2' is returned.</p>
