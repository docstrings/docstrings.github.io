<h3>Variable: x-lost-selection-functions</h3>
<p>
A list of functions to be called when Emacs loses an X selection.<br>
(This happens when some other X client makes its own selection<br>
or when a Lisp program explicitly clears the selection.)<br>
The functions are called with one argument, the selection type<br>
(a symbol, typically `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', or `CLIPBOARD').</p>
