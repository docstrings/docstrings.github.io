PLACE must be a valid generalized variable.<br>
DO must be a function; it will be called with 2 arguments: GETTER and SETTER,<br>
where GETTER is a (copyable) Elisp expression that returns the value of PLACE,<br>
and SETTER is a function which returns the code to set PLACE when called<br>
with a (not necessarily copyable) Elisp expression that returns the value to<br>
set it to.<br>
