<h3>Variable: max-specpdl-size</h3>
<p>
Limit on number of Lisp variable bindings and `unwind-protect's.
If Lisp code tries to increase the total number past this amount,
an error is signaled.
You can safely use a value considerably larger than the default value,
if that proves inconveniently small.  However, if you increase it too far,
Emacs could run out of memory trying to make the stack bigger.</p>
