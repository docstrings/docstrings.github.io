<h3>Variable: max-specpdl-size</h3>
<p>
Limit on number of Lisp variable bindings and `unwind-protect's.<br>
If Lisp code tries to increase the total number past this amount,<br>
an error is signaled.<br>
You can safely use a value considerably larger than the default value,<br>
if that proves inconveniently small.  However, if you increase it too far,<br>
Emacs could run out of memory trying to make the stack bigger.</p>
