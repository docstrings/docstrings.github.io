<h3>Variable: buffer-substring-filters</h3>
<p>
List of filter functions for `filter-buffer-substring'.<br>
Each function must accept a single argument, a string, and return<br>
a string.  The buffer substring is passed to the first function<br>
in the list, and the return value of each function is passed to<br>
the next.  The final result (if `buffer-substring-filters' is<br>
nil, this is the unfiltered buffer-substring) is passed to the<br>
first function on `filter-buffer-substring-functions'.<br>
<br>
As a special convention, point is set to the start of the buffer text<br>
being operated on (i.e., the first argument of `filter-buffer-substring')
before these functions are called.</p>
