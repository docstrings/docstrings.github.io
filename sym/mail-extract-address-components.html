<h3>Function: mail-extract-address-components</h3>
<p>
Given an RFC-822 address ADDRESS, extract full name and canonical address.
Returns a list of the form (FULL-NAME CANONICAL-ADDRESS).  If no
name can be extracted, FULL-NAME will be nil.  Also see
`mail-extr-ignore-single-names' and
`mail-extr-ignore-realname-equals-mailbox-name'.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument ALL is non-nil, then ADDRESS can contain zero
or more recipients, separated by commas, and we return a list of
the form ((FULL-NAME CANONICAL-ADDRESS) ...) with one element for
each recipient.  If ALL is nil, then if ADDRESS contains more than
one recipients, all but the first is ignored.</p>
<p>
ADDRESS may be a string or a buffer.  If it is a buffer, the visible
(narrowed) portion of the buffer will be interpreted as the address.
(This feature exists so that the clever caller might be able to avoid
consing a string.)</p>
