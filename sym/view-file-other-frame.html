<h3>Function: view-file-other-frame</h3>
<p>
View FILE in View mode in another frame.
When done, kill the buffer visiting FILE if unmodified and if it wasn't
visited before; also, maybe delete other frame and/or return to previous
buffer.</p>
<p>
Emacs commands editing the buffer contents are not available; instead,
a special set of commands (mostly letters and punctuation)
are defined for moving around in the buffer.
Space scrolls forward, Delete scrolls backward.
For a list of all View commands, type H or h while viewing.</p>
<p>
This command runs the normal hook `view-mode-hook'.</p>
