<h3>Variable: Info-enable-edit</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means the M-x Info-edit command in Info can edit the current node.<br>
This is convenient if you want to write Info files by hand.<br>
However, we recommend that you not do this.<br>
It is better to write a Texinfo file and generate the Info file from that,<br>
because that gives you a printed manual as well.</p>
