<h3>Variable: Info-enable-edit</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means the M-x Info-edit command in Info can edit the current node.
This is convenient if you want to write Info files by hand.
However, we recommend that you not do this.
It is better to write a Texinfo file and generate the Info file from that,
because that gives you a printed manual as well.</p>
