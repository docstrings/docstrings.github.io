<h3>Function: read-char-exclusive</h3>
<p>
Read a character from the command input (keyboard or macro).
It is returned as a number.  Non-character events are ignored.
If the character has modifiers, they are resolved and reflected to the
character code if possible (e.g. C-SPC -> 0).</p>
<p>
If the optional argument PROMPT is non-nil, display that as a prompt.
If the optional argument INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD is non-nil and some
input method is turned on in the current buffer, that input method
is used for reading a character.
If the optional argument SECONDS is non-nil, it should be a number
specifying the maximum number of seconds to wait for input.  If no
input arrives in that time, return nil.  SECONDS may be a
floating-point value.</p>
