<h3>Function: gnus-extract-address-components</h3>
<p>
Extract address components from a From header.
Given an RFC-822 address FROM, extract full name and canonical address.
Returns a list of the form (FULL-NAME CANONICAL-ADDRESS).  Much more simple
solution than `mail-extract-address-components', which works much better, but
is slower.</p>
