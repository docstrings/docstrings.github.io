<h3>Function: pr-ps-buffer-preview</h3>
<p>
Preview buffer using ghostview.<br>
<br>
Interactively, the command prompts for N-UP printing number and, when you use a<br>
prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the user for a file name, and saves<br>
the PostScript image in that file instead of saving it in a temporary file.<br>
<br>
Noninteractively, if N-UP is nil, prompts for N-UP printing number.  The<br>
argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it's nil, save the image in a<br>
temporary file.  If FILENAME is a string, save the PostScript image in a file<br>
with that name.  If FILENAME is t, prompts for a file name.

(fn N-UP &optional FILENAME)</p>
