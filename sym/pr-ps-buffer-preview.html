<h3>Function: pr-ps-buffer-preview</h3>
<p>
Preview buffer using ghostview.</p>
<p>
Interactively, the command prompts for N-UP printing number and, when you use a
prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the user for a file name, and saves
the PostScript image in that file instead of saving it in a temporary file.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, if N-UP is nil, prompts for N-UP printing number.  The
argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it's nil, save the image in a
temporary file.  If FILENAME is a string, save the PostScript image in a file
with that name.  If FILENAME is t, prompts for a file name.</p>
<p>
(fn N-UP &optional FILENAME)</p>
