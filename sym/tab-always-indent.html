<h3>Variable: tab-always-indent</h3>
<p>
Controls the operation of the TAB key.<br>
If t, hitting TAB always just indents the current line.<br>
If nil, hitting TAB indents the current line if point is at the left margin<br>
or in the line's indentation, otherwise it inserts a "real" TAB character.<br>
If `complete', TAB first tries to indent the current line, and if the line<br>
was already indented, then try to complete the thing at point.<br>
<br>
Some programming language modes have their own variable to control this,<br>
e.g., `c-tab-always-indent', and do not respect this variable.</p>
