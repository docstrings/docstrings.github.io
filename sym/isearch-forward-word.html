<h3>Function: isearch-forward-word</h3>
<p>
Do incremental search forward for a sequence of words.
With a prefix argument, do a regular string search instead.
Like ordinary incremental search except that your input is treated
as a sequence of words without regard to how the words are separated.
See the command `isearch-forward' for more information.</p>
