<h3>Variable: process-environment</h3>
<p>
List of overridden environment variables for subprocesses to inherit.<br>
Each element should be a string of the form ENVVARNAME=VALUE.<br>
<br>
Entries in this list take precedence to those in the frame-local<br>
environments.  Therefore, let-binding `process-environment' is an easy<br>
way to temporarily change the value of an environment variable,<br>
irrespective of where it comes from.  To use `process-environment' to<br>
remove an environment variable, include only its name in the list,<br>
without "=VALUE".<br>
<br>
This variable is set to nil when Emacs starts.<br>
<br>
If multiple entries define the same variable, the first one always<br>
takes precedence.<br>
<br>
Non-ASCII characters are encoded according to the initial value of<br>
`locale-coding-system', i.e. the elements must normally be decoded for
use.

See `setenv' and `getenv'.</p>
