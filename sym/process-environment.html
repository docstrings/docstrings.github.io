<h3>Variable: process-environment</h3>
<p>
List of overridden environment variables for subprocesses to inherit.
Each element should be a string of the form ENVVARNAME=VALUE.</p>
<p>
Entries in this list take precedence to those in the frame-local
environments.  Therefore, let-binding `process-environment' is an easy
way to temporarily change the value of an environment variable,
irrespective of where it comes from.  To use `process-environment' to
remove an environment variable, include only its name in the list,
without "=VALUE".</p>
<p>
This variable is set to nil when Emacs starts.</p>
<p>
If multiple entries define the same variable, the first one always
takes precedence.</p>
<p>
Non-ASCII characters are encoded according to the initial value of
`locale-coding-system', i.e. the elements must normally be decoded for
use.</p>
<p>
See `setenv' and `getenv'.</p>
