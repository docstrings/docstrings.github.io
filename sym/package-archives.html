<h3>Variable: package-archives</h3>
<p>
An alist of archives from which to fetch.
The default value points to the GNU Emacs package repository.</p>
<p>
Each element has the form (ID . LOCATION).
 ID is an archive name, as a string.
 LOCATION specifies the base location for the archive.
  If it starts with "http:", it is treated as a HTTP URL;
  otherwise it should be an absolute directory name.
  (Other types of URL are currently not supported.)</p>
<p>
Only add locations that you trust, since fetching and installing
a package can run arbitrary code.</p>
