<h3>Variable: package-archives</h3>
<p>
An alist of archives from which to fetch.<br>
The default value points to the GNU Emacs package repository.<br>
<br>
Each element has the form (ID . LOCATION).<br>
 ID is an archive name, as a string.<br>
 LOCATION specifies the base location for the archive.<br>
  If it starts with "http:", it is treated as a HTTP URL;<br>
  otherwise it should be an absolute directory name.<br>
  (Other types of URL are currently not supported.)<br>
<br>
Only add locations that you trust, since fetching and installing
a package can run arbitrary code.</p>
