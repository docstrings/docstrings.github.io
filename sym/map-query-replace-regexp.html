<h3>Function: map-query-replace-regexp</h3>
<p>
Replace some matches for REGEXP with various strings, in rotation.<br>
The second argument TO-STRINGS contains the replacement strings, separated<br>
by spaces.  This command works like `query-replace-regexp' except that<br>
each successive replacement uses the next successive replacement string,<br>
wrapping around from the last such string to the first.<br>
<br>
In Transient Mark mode, if the mark is active, operate on the contents<br>
of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the end of the buffer.<br>
<br>
Non-interactively, TO-STRINGS may be a list of replacement strings.<br>
<br>
Use M-n to pull the last incremental search regexp to the minibuffer<br>
that reads REGEXP.<br>
<br>
A prefix argument N says to use each replacement string N times<br>
before rotating to the next.<br>
Fourth and fifth arg START and END specify the region to operate on.</p>
