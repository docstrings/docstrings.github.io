<h3>Function: map-query-replace-regexp</h3>
<p>
Replace some matches for REGEXP with various strings, in rotation.
The second argument TO-STRINGS contains the replacement strings, separated
by spaces.  This command works like `query-replace-regexp' except that
each successive replacement uses the next successive replacement string,
wrapping around from the last such string to the first.</p>
<p>
In Transient Mark mode, if the mark is active, operate on the contents
of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the end of the buffer.</p>
<p>
Non-interactively, TO-STRINGS may be a list of replacement strings.</p>
<p>
Use M-n to pull the last incremental search regexp to the minibuffer
that reads REGEXP.</p>
<p>
A prefix argument N says to use each replacement string N times
before rotating to the next.
Fourth and fifth arg START and END specify the region to operate on.</p>
