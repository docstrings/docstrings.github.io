<h3>Function: ansi-color-filter-region</h3>
<p>
Filter out all ANSI control sequences from region BEGIN to END.</p>
<p>
Every call to this function will set and use the buffer-local variable
`ansi-color-context-region' to save position.  This information will be
used for the next call to `ansi-color-apply-on-region'.  Specifically,
it will override BEGIN, the start of the region.  Set
`ansi-color-context-region' to nil if you don't want this.</p>
