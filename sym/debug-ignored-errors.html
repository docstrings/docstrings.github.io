<h3>Variable: debug-ignored-errors</h3>
<p>
List of errors for which the debugger should not be called.<br>
Each element may be a condition-name or a regexp that matches error messages.<br>
If any element applies to a given error, that error skips the debugger<br>
and just returns to top level.<br>
This overrides the variable `debug-on-error'.<br>
It does not apply to errors handled by `condition-case'.</p>
