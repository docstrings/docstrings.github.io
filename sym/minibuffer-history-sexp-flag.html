<h3>Variable: minibuffer-history-sexp-flag</h3>
<p>
Control whether history list elements are expressions or strings.<br>
If the value of this variable equals current minibuffer depth,<br>
they are expressions; otherwise they are strings.<br>
(That convention is designed to do the right thing for<br>
recursive uses of the minibuffer.)</p>
