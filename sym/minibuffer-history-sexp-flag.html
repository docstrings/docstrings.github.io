<h3>Variable: minibuffer-history-sexp-flag</h3>
<p>
Control whether history list elements are expressions or strings.
If the value of this variable equals current minibuffer depth,
they are expressions; otherwise they are strings.
(That convention is designed to do the right thing for
recursive uses of the minibuffer.)</p>
