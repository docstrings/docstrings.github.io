<h3>Function: define-abbrev-table</h3>
<p>
Define TABLENAME (a symbol) as an abbrev table name.
Define abbrevs in it according to DEFINITIONS, which is a list of elements
of the form (ABBREVNAME EXPANSION ...) that are passed to `define-abbrev'.
PROPS is a property list to apply to the table.
Properties with special meaning:
- `:parents' contains a list of abbrev tables from which this table inherits
  abbreviations.
- `:case-fixed' non-nil means that abbreviations are looked up without
  case-folding, and the expansion is not capitalized/upcased.
- `:regexp' is a regular expression that specifies how to extract the
  name of the abbrev before point.  The submatch 1 is treated
  as the potential name of an abbrev.  If :regexp is nil, the default
  behavior uses `backward-word' and `forward-word' to extract the name
  of the abbrev, which can therefore only be a single word.
- `:enable-function' can be set to a function of no argument which returns
  non-nil if and only if the abbrevs in this table should be used for this
  instance of `expand-abbrev'.</p>
