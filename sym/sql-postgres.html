<h3>Function: sql-postgres</h3>
<p>
Run psql by Postgres as an inferior process.</p>
<p>
If buffer `*SQL*' exists but no process is running, make a new process.
If buffer exists and a process is running, just switch to buffer
`*SQL*'.</p>
<p>
Interpreter used comes from variable `sql-postgres-program'.  Login uses
the variables `sql-database' and `sql-server' as default, if set.
Additional command line parameters can be stored in the list
`sql-postgres-options'.</p>
<p>
The buffer is put in SQL interactive mode, giving commands for sending
input.  See `sql-interactive-mode'.</p>
<p>
To set the buffer name directly, use C-u
before M-x sql-postgres.  Once session has started,
M-x sql-rename-buffer can be called separately to rename the
buffer.</p>
<p>
To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the input and output to the process, use C-x RET c
before M-x sql-postgres.  You can also specify this with C-x RET p
in the SQL buffer, after you start the process.
The default comes from `process-coding-system-alist' and
`default-process-coding-system'.  If your output lines end with ^M,
your might try undecided-dos as a coding system.  If this doesn't help,
Try to set `comint-output-filter-functions' like this:</p>
<p>
(setq comint-output-filter-functions (append comint-output-filter-functions
					     '(comint-strip-ctrl-m)))</p>
<p>
(Type C-h m in the SQL buffer for a list of commands.)</p>
<p>
(fn &optional BUFFER)</p>
