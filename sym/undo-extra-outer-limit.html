<h3>Variable: undo-extra-outer-limit</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, an extra level of size that's ok in an undo item.<br>
We don't ask the user about truncating the undo list until the<br>
current item gets bigger than this amount.<br>
<br>
This variable only matters if `undo-ask-before-discard' is non-nil.</p>
