<h3>Function: set-justification-left</h3>
<p>
Make paragraphs in the region left-justified.<br>
This means they are flush at the left margin and ragged on the right.<br>
This is usually the default, but see the variable `default-justification'.<br>
If the mark is not active, this applies to the current paragraph.</p>
