<h3>Function: gnus-no-server</h3>
<p>
Read network news.
If ARG is a positive number, Gnus will use that as the startup
level. If ARG is nil, Gnus will be started at level 2.  If ARG is
non-nil and not a positive number, Gnus will prompt the user for the
name of an NNTP server to use.
As opposed to `gnus', this command will not connect to the local
server.</p>
