<h3>Function: forward-word</h3>
<p>
Move point forward ARG words (backward if ARG is negative).
Normally returns t.
If an edge of the buffer or a field boundary is reached, point is left there
and the function returns nil.  Field boundaries are not noticed if
`inhibit-field-text-motion' is non-nil.</p>
