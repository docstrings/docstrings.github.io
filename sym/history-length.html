<h3>Variable: history-length</h3>
<p>
Maximum length of history lists before truncation takes place.<br>
A number means truncate to that length; truncation deletes old<br>
elements, and is done just after inserting a new element.<br>
A value of t means no truncation.<br>
<br>
This variable only affects history lists that don't specify their own<br>
maximum lengths.  Setting the `history-length' property of a history<br>
variable overrides this default.</p>
