<h3>Variable: history-length</h3>
<p>
Maximum length of history lists before truncation takes place.
A number means truncate to that length; truncation deletes old
elements, and is done just after inserting a new element.
A value of t means no truncation.</p>
<p>
This variable only affects history lists that don't specify their own
maximum lengths.  Setting the `history-length' property of a history
variable overrides this default.</p>
