<h3>Function: insert-pair</h3>
<p>
Enclose following ARG sexps in a pair of OPEN and CLOSE characters.
Leave point after the first character.
A negative ARG encloses the preceding ARG sexps instead.
No argument is equivalent to zero: just insert characters
and leave point between.
If `parens-require-spaces' is non-nil, this command also inserts a space
before and after, depending on the surrounding characters.
If region is active, insert enclosing characters at region boundaries.</p>
<p>
If arguments OPEN and CLOSE are nil, the character pair is found
from the variable `insert-pair-alist' according to the last input
character with or without modifiers.  If no character pair is
found in the variable `insert-pair-alist', then the last input
character is inserted ARG times.</p>
<p>
This command assumes point is not in a string or comment.</p>
