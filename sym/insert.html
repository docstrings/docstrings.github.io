<h3>Function: insert</h3>
<p>
Insert the arguments, either strings or characters, at point.
Point and before-insertion markers move forward to end up
 after the inserted text.
Any other markers at the point of insertion remain before the text.</p>
<p>
If the current buffer is multibyte, unibyte strings are converted
to multibyte for insertion (see `string-make-multibyte').
If the current buffer is unibyte, multibyte strings are converted
to unibyte for insertion (see `string-make-unibyte').</p>
<p>
When operating on binary data, it may be necessary to preserve the
original bytes of a unibyte string when inserting it into a multibyte
buffer; to accomplish this, apply `string-as-multibyte' to the string
and insert the result.</p>
