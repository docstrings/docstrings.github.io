<h3>Function: get-buffer-window-list</h3>
<p>
Return list of all windows displaying BUFFER-OR-NAME, or nil if none.
BUFFER-OR-NAME may be a buffer or the name of an existing buffer
and defaults to the current buffer.  Windows are scanned starting
with the selected window.</p>
<p>
MINIBUF t means include the minibuffer window even if the
minibuffer is not active.  MINIBUF nil or omitted means include
the minibuffer window only if the minibuffer is active.  Any
other value means do not include the minibuffer window even if
the minibuffer is active.</p>
<p>
ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted means consider all windows on the
selected frame, plus the minibuffer window if specified by the
MINIBUF argument.  If the minibuffer counts, consider all windows
on all frames that share that minibuffer too.  The following
non-nil values of ALL-FRAMES have special meanings:</p>
<p>
- t means consider all windows on all existing frames.</p>
<p>
- `visible' means consider all windows on all visible frames on
  the current terminal.</p>
<p>
- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible
  and iconified frames on the current terminal.</p>
<p>
- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.</p>
<p>
Anything else means consider all windows on the selected frame
and no others.</p>
