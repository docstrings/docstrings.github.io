<h3>Variable: mail-citation-hook</h3>
<p>
Hook for modifying a citation just inserted in the mail buffer.<br>
Each hook function can find the citation between (point) and (mark t),<br>
and should leave point and mark around the citation text as modified.<br>
The hook functions can find the header of the cited message<br>
in the variable `mail-citation-header', whether or not this is included<br>
in the cited portion of the message.<br>
<br>
If this hook is entirely empty (nil), a default action is taken
instead of no action.</p>
