<h3>Function: replace-string</h3>
<p>
Replace occurrences of FROM-STRING with TO-STRING.
Preserve case in each match if `case-replace' and `case-fold-search'
are non-nil and FROM-STRING has no uppercase letters.
(Preserving case means that if the string matched is all caps, or capitalized,
then its replacement is upcased or capitalized.)</p>
<p>
If `replace-lax-whitespace' is non-nil, a space or spaces in the string
to be replaced will match a sequence of whitespace chars defined by the
regexp in `search-whitespace-regexp'.</p>
<p>
In Transient Mark mode, if the mark is active, operate on the contents
of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the end of the buffer.</p>
<p>
Third arg DELIMITED (prefix arg if interactive), if non-nil, means replace
only matches surrounded by word boundaries.
Fourth and fifth arg START and END specify the region to operate on.</p>
<p>
Use M-n to pull the last incremental search string to the minibuffer
that reads FROM-STRING.</p>
<p>
This function is usually the wrong thing to use in a Lisp program.
What you probably want is a loop like this:
  (while (search-forward FROM-STRING nil t)
    (replace-match TO-STRING nil t))
which will run faster and will not set the mark or print anything.
(You may need a more complex loop if FROM-STRING can match the null string
and TO-STRING is also null.)</p>
