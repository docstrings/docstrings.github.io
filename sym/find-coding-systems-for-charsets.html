<h3>Function: find-coding-systems-for-charsets</h3>
<p>
Return a list of proper coding systems to encode characters of CHARSETS.<br>
CHARSETS is a list of character sets.<br>
<br>
This only finds coding systems of type `charset', whose<br>
`:charset-list' property includes all of CHARSETS (plus `ascii' for<br>
ASCII-compatible coding systems).  It was used in older versions of<br>
Emacs, but is unlikely to be what you really want now.</p>
