<h3>Function: find-coding-systems-for-charsets</h3>
<p>
Return a list of proper coding systems to encode characters of CHARSETS.
CHARSETS is a list of character sets.</p>
<p>
This only finds coding systems of type `charset', whose
`:charset-list' property includes all of CHARSETS (plus `ascii' for
ASCII-compatible coding systems).  It was used in older versions of
Emacs, but is unlikely to be what you really want now.</p>
