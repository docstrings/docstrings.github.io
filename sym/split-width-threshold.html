<h3>Variable: split-width-threshold</h3>
<p>
Minimum width for splitting windows sensibly.
If this is an integer, `split-window-sensibly' may split a window
horizontally only if it has at least this many columns.  If this
is nil, `split-window-sensibly' is not allowed to split a window
horizontally.</p>
