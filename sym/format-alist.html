<h3>Variable: format-alist</h3>
<p>
List of information about understood file formats.<br>
Elements are of the form<br>
(NAME DOC-STR REGEXP FROM-FN TO-FN MODIFY MODE-FN PRESERVE).<br>
<br>
NAME    is a symbol, which is stored in `buffer-file-format'.<br>
<br>
DOC-STR should be a single line providing more information about the<br>
        format.  It is currently unused, but in the future will be shown to<br>
        the user if they ask for more information.<br>
<br>
REGEXP  is a regular expression to match against the beginning of the file;<br>
        it should match only files in that format.  REGEXP may be nil, in<br>
        which case the format will never be applied automatically to a file.<br>
        Use this for formats that you only ever want to apply manually.<br>
<br>
FROM-FN is called to decode files in that format; it takes two args, BEGIN<br>
        and END, and can make any modifications it likes, returning the new<br>
        end.  It must make sure that the beginning of the file no longer<br>
        matches REGEXP, or else it will get called again.<br>
	Alternatively, FROM-FN can be a string, which specifies a shell command<br>
	(including options) to be used as a filter to perform the conversion.<br>
<br>
TO-FN   is called to encode a region into that format; it takes three<br>
        arguments: BEGIN, END, and BUFFER.  BUFFER is the original buffer that<br>
        the data being written came from, which the function could use, for<br>
        example, to find the values of local variables.  TO-FN should either<br>
        return a list of annotations like `write-region-annotate-functions',<br>
        or modify the region and return the new end.<br>
	Alternatively, TO-FN can be a string, which specifies a shell command<br>
	(including options) to be used as a filter to perform the conversion.<br>
<br>
MODIFY, if non-nil, means the TO-FN wants to modify the region.  If nil,<br>
        TO-FN will not make any changes but will instead return a list of<br>
        annotations.<br>
<br>
MODE-FN, if specified, is called when visiting a file with that format.<br>
         It is called with a single positive argument, on the assumption<br>
         that this would turn on some minor mode.

PRESERVE, if non-nil, means that `format-write-file' should not remove
          this format from `buffer-file-format'.</p>
