<h3>Variable: format-alist</h3>
<p>
List of information about understood file formats.
Elements are of the form
(NAME DOC-STR REGEXP FROM-FN TO-FN MODIFY MODE-FN PRESERVE).</p>
<p>
NAME    is a symbol, which is stored in `buffer-file-format'.</p>
<p>
DOC-STR should be a single line providing more information about the
        format.  It is currently unused, but in the future will be shown to
        the user if they ask for more information.</p>
<p>
REGEXP  is a regular expression to match against the beginning of the file;
        it should match only files in that format.  REGEXP may be nil, in
        which case the format will never be applied automatically to a file.
        Use this for formats that you only ever want to apply manually.</p>
<p>
FROM-FN is called to decode files in that format; it takes two args, BEGIN
        and END, and can make any modifications it likes, returning the new
        end.  It must make sure that the beginning of the file no longer
        matches REGEXP, or else it will get called again.
	Alternatively, FROM-FN can be a string, which specifies a shell command
	(including options) to be used as a filter to perform the conversion.</p>
<p>
TO-FN   is called to encode a region into that format; it takes three
        arguments: BEGIN, END, and BUFFER.  BUFFER is the original buffer that
        the data being written came from, which the function could use, for
        example, to find the values of local variables.  TO-FN should either
        return a list of annotations like `write-region-annotate-functions',
        or modify the region and return the new end.
	Alternatively, TO-FN can be a string, which specifies a shell command
	(including options) to be used as a filter to perform the conversion.</p>
<p>
MODIFY, if non-nil, means the TO-FN wants to modify the region.  If nil,
        TO-FN will not make any changes but will instead return a list of
        annotations.</p>
<p>
MODE-FN, if specified, is called when visiting a file with that format.
         It is called with a single positive argument, on the assumption
         that this would turn on some minor mode.</p>
<p>
PRESERVE, if non-nil, means that `format-write-file' should not remove
          this format from `buffer-file-format'.</p>
