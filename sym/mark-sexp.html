<h3>Function: mark-sexp</h3>
<p>
Set mark ARG sexps from point.
The place mark goes is the same place C-M-f would
move to with the same argument.
Interactively, if this command is repeated
or (in Transient Mark mode) if the mark is active,
it marks the next ARG sexps after the ones already marked.
This command assumes point is not in a string or comment.</p>
