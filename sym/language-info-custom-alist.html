<h3>Variable: language-info-custom-alist</h3>
<p>
Customizations of language environment parameters.
Value is an alist with elements like those of `language-info-alist'.
These are used to set values in `language-info-alist' which replace
the defaults.  A typical use is replacing the default input method for
the environment.  Use C-h L to find the environment's settings.</p>
<p>
This option is intended for use at startup.  Removing items doesn't
remove them from the language info until you next restart Emacs.</p>
<p>
Setting this variable directly does not take effect.
See `set-language-info-alist' for use in programs.</p>
