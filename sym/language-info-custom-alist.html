<h3>Variable: language-info-custom-alist</h3>
<p>
Customizations of language environment parameters.<br>
Value is an alist with elements like those of `language-info-alist'.<br>
These are used to set values in `language-info-alist' which replace<br>
the defaults.  A typical use is replacing the default input method for<br>
the environment.  Use C-h L to find the environment's settings.<br>
<br>
This option is intended for use at startup.  Removing items doesn't<br>
remove them from the language info until you next restart Emacs.<br>
<br>
Setting this variable directly does not take effect.<br>
See `set-language-info-alist' for use in programs.</p>
