<h3>Function: comint-write-output</h3>
<p>
Write output from interpreter since last input to FILENAME.
Any prompt at the end of the output is not written.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument APPEND (the prefix argument when interactive)
is non-nil, the output is appended to the file instead.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument MUSTBENEW is non-nil, check for an existing
file with the same name.  If MUSTBENEW is `excl', that means to get an
error if the file already exists; never overwrite.  If MUSTBENEW is
neither nil nor `excl', that means ask for confirmation before
overwriting, but do go ahead and overwrite the file if the user
confirms.  When interactive, MUSTBENEW is nil when appending, and t
otherwise.</p>
<p>
(fn FILENAME &optional APPEND MUSTBENEW)</p>
