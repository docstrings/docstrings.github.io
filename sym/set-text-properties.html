<h3>Function: set-text-properties</h3>
<p>
Completely replace properties of text from START to END.
The third argument PROPERTIES is the new property list.
If the optional fourth argument OBJECT is a buffer (or nil, which means
the current buffer), START and END are buffer positions (integers or
markers).  If OBJECT is a string, START and END are 0-based indices into it.
If PROPERTIES is nil, the effect is to remove all properties from
the designated part of OBJECT.</p>
<p>
(fn START END PROPERTIES &optional OBJECT)</p>
