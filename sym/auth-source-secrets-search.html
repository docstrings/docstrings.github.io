<h3>Function: auth-source-secrets-search</h3>
<p>
Search the Secrets API; spec is like `auth-source'.</p>
<p>
The :label key specifies the item's label.  It is the only key
that can specify a substring.  Any :label value besides a string
will allow any label.</p>
<p>
All other search keys must match exactly.  If you need substring
matching, do a wider search and narrow it down yourself.</p>
<p>
You'll get back all the properties of the token as a plist.</p>
<p>
Here's an example that looks for the first item in the 'Login'
Secrets collection:</p>
<p>
 (let ((auth-sources '("secrets:Login")))
    (auth-source-search :max 1)</p>
<p>
Here's another that looks for the first item in the 'Login'
Secrets collection whose label contains 'gnus':</p>
<p>
 (let ((auth-sources '("secrets:Login")))
    (auth-source-search :max 1 :label "gnus")</p>
<p>
And this one looks for the first item in the 'Login' Secrets
collection that's a Google Chrome entry for the git.gnus.org site
authentication tokens:</p>
<p>
 (let ((auth-sources '("secrets:Login")))
    (auth-source-search :max 1 :signon_realm "https://git.gnus.org/Git"))</p>
