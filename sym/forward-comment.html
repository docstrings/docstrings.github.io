<h3>Function: forward-comment</h3>
<p>
Move forward across up to COUNT comments.  If COUNT is negative, move backward.<br>
Stop scanning if we find something other than a comment or whitespace.<br>
Set point to where scanning stops.<br>
If COUNT comments are found as expected, with nothing except whitespace<br>
between them, return t; otherwise return nil.
