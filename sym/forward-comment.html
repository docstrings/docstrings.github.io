<h3>Function: forward-comment</h3>
<p>
Move forward across up to COUNT comments.  If COUNT is negative, move backward.
Stop scanning if we find something other than a comment or whitespace.
Set point to where scanning stops.
If COUNT comments are found as expected, with nothing except whitespace
between them, return t; otherwise return nil.</p>
