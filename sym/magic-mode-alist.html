<h3>Variable: magic-mode-alist</h3>
<p>
Alist of buffer beginnings vs. corresponding major mode functions.<br>
Each element looks like (REGEXP . FUNCTION) or (MATCH-FUNCTION . FUNCTION).<br>
After visiting a file, if REGEXP matches the text at the beginning of the<br>
buffer, or calling MATCH-FUNCTION returns non-nil, `normal-mode' will<br>
call FUNCTION rather than allowing `auto-mode-alist' to decide the buffer's<br>
major mode.<br>
<br>
If FUNCTION is nil, then it is not called.  (That is a way of saying<br>
"allow `auto-mode-alist' to decide for these files.")</p>
