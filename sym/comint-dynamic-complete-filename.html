<h3>Function: comint-dynamic-complete-filename</h3>
<p>
Dynamically complete the filename at point.
Completes if after a filename.
This function is similar to `comint-replace-by-expanded-filename', except that
it won't change parts of the filename already entered in the buffer; it just
adds completion characters to the end of the filename.  A completions listing
may be shown in a separate buffer if completion is ambiguous.</p>
<p>
Completion is dependent on the value of `comint-completion-addsuffix',
`comint-completion-recexact' and `comint-completion-fignore', and the timing of
completions listing is dependent on the value of `comint-completion-autolist'.</p>
<p>
Returns t if successful.</p>
