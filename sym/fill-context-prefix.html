<h3>Function: fill-context-prefix</h3>
<p>
Compute a fill prefix from the text between FROM and TO.<br>
This uses the variables `adaptive-fill-regexp' and `adaptive-fill-function'<br>
and `adaptive-fill-first-line-regexp'.  `paragraph-start' also plays a role;<br>
we reject a prefix based on a one-line paragraph if that prefix would<br>
act as a paragraph-separator.</p>
