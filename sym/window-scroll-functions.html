<h3>Variable: window-scroll-functions</h3>
<p>
List of functions to call before redisplaying a window with scrolling.<br>
Each function is called with two arguments, the window and its new<br>
display-start position.  Note that these functions are also called by<br>
`set-window-buffer'.  Also note that the value of `window-end' is not<br>
valid when these functions are called.<br>
<br>
Warning: Do not use this feature to alter the way the window<br>
is scrolled.  It is not designed for that, and such use probably won't
work.</p>
