<h3>Variable: scroll-conservatively</h3>
<p>
Scroll up to this many lines, to bring point back on screen.
If point moves off-screen, redisplay will scroll by up to
`scroll-conservatively' lines in order to bring point just barely
onto the screen again.  If that cannot be done, then redisplay
recenters point as usual.</p>
<p>
If the value is greater than 100, redisplay will never recenter point,
but will always scroll just enough text to bring point into view, even
if you move far away.</p>
<p>
A value of zero means always recenter point if it moves off screen.</p>
