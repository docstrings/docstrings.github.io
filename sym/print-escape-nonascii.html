<h3>Variable: print-escape-nonascii</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means print unibyte non-ASCII chars in strings as \OOO.<br>
(OOO is the octal representation of the character code.)<br>
Only single-byte characters are affected, and only in `prin1'.<br>
When the output goes in a multibyte buffer, this feature is<br>
enabled regardless of the value of the variable.</p>
