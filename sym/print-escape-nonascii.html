<h3>Variable: print-escape-nonascii</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means print unibyte non-ASCII chars in strings as \OOO.
(OOO is the octal representation of the character code.)
Only single-byte characters are affected, and only in `prin1'.
When the output goes in a multibyte buffer, this feature is
enabled regardless of the value of the variable.</p>
