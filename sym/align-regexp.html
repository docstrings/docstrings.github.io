<h3>Function: align-regexp</h3>
<p>
Align the current region using an ad-hoc rule read from the minibuffer.
BEG and END mark the limits of the region.  This function will prompt
for the REGEXP to align with.  If no prefix arg was specified, you
only need to supply the characters to be lined up and any preceding
whitespace is replaced.  If a prefix arg was specified, the full
regexp with parenthesized whitespace should be supplied; it will also
prompt for which parenthesis GROUP within REGEXP to modify, the amount
of SPACING to use, and whether or not to REPEAT the rule throughout
the line.  See `align-rules-list' for more information about these
options.</p>
<p>
For example, let's say you had a list of phone numbers, and wanted to
align them so that the opening parentheses would line up:</p>
<p>
    Fred (123) 456-7890
    Alice (123) 456-7890
    Mary-Anne (123) 456-7890
    Joe (123) 456-7890</p>
<p>
There is no predefined rule to handle this, but you could easily do it
using a REGEXP like "(".  All you would have to do is to mark the
region, call `align-regexp' and type in that regular expression.</p>
<p>
(fn BEG END REGEXP &optional GROUP SPACING REPEAT)</p>
