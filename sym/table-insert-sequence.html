<h3>Function: table-insert-sequence</h3>
<p>
Travel cells forward while inserting a specified sequence string in each cell.
STR is the base string from which the sequence starts.  When STR is an
empty string then each cell content is erased.  When STR ends with
numerical characters (they may optionally be surrounded by a pair of
parentheses) they are incremented as a decimal number.  Otherwise the
last character in STR is incremented in ASCII code order.  N is the
number of sequence elements to insert.  When N is negative the cell
traveling direction is backward.  When N is zero it travels forward
entire table.  INCREMENT is the increment between adjacent sequence
elements and can be a negative number for effectively decrementing.
INTERVAL is the number of cells to travel between sequence element
insertion which is normally 1.  When zero or less is given for
INTERVAL it is interpreted as number of cells per row so that sequence
is placed straight down vertically as long as the table's cell
structure is uniform.  JUSTIFY is one of the symbol 'left, 'center or
'right, that specifies justification of the inserted string.</p>

Example:</p>
<p>
  (progn
    (table-insert 16 3 5 1)
    (table-forward-cell 15)
    (table-insert-sequence "D0" -16 1 1 'center)
    (table-forward-cell 16)
    (table-insert-sequence "A[0]" -16 1 1 'center)
    (table-forward-cell 1)
    (table-insert-sequence "-" 16 0 1 'center))</p>
<p>
  (progn
    (table-insert 16 8 5 1)
    (table-insert-sequence "@" 0 1 2 'right)
    (table-forward-cell 1)
    (table-insert-sequence "64" 0 1 2 'left))</p>
