<h3>Function: reindent-then-newline-and-indent</h3>
<p>
Reindent current line, insert newline, then indent the new line.<br>
Indentation of both lines is done according to the current major mode,<br>
which means calling the current value of `indent-line-function'.<br>
In programming language modes, this is the same as TAB.<br>
In some text modes, where TAB inserts a tab, this indents to the<br>
column specified by the function `current-left-margin'.</p>
