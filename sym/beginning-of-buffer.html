<h3>Function: beginning-of-buffer</h3>
<p>
Move point to the beginning of the buffer.
With numeric arg N, put point N/10 of the way from the beginning.
If the buffer is narrowed, this command uses the beginning of the
accessible part of the buffer.</p>
<p>
If Transient Mark mode is disabled, leave mark at previous
position, unless a C-u prefix is supplied.</p>
<p>
Don't use this command in Lisp programs!
(goto-char (point-min)) is faster.</p>
