<h3>Function: beginning-of-buffer</h3>
<p>
Move point to the beginning of the buffer.<br>
With numeric arg N, put point N/10 of the way from the beginning.<br>
If the buffer is narrowed, this command uses the beginning of the<br>
accessible part of the buffer.<br>
<br>
If Transient Mark mode is disabled, leave mark at previous<br>
position, unless a C-u prefix is supplied.<br>
<br>
Don't use this command in Lisp programs!<br>
(goto-char (point-min)) is faster.</p>
