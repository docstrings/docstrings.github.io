<h3>Variable: sgml-specials</h3>
<p>
List of characters that have a special meaning for SGML mode.
This list is used when first loading the `sgml-mode' library.
The supported characters and potential disadvantages are:</p>
<p>
  ?\"	Makes " in text start a string.
  ?'	Makes ' in text start a string.
  ?-	Makes -- in text start a comment.</p>
<p>
When only one of ?\" or ?' are included, "'" or '"', as can be found in
DTDs, start a string.  To partially avoid this problem this also makes these
self insert as named entities depending on `sgml-quick-keys'.</p>
<p>
Including ?- has the problem of affecting dashes that have nothing to do
with comments, so we normally turn it off.</p>
