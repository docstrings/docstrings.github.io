<h3>Variable: comment-use-global-state</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means that the global syntactic context is used.<br>
More specifically, it means that `syntax-ppss' is used to find out whether<br>
point is within a string or not.  Major modes whose syntax is faithfully<br>
described by the syntax-tables can set this to non-nil so comment markers<br>
in strings will not confuse Emacs.</p>
