<h3>Function: insert-parentheses</h3>
<p>
Enclose following ARG sexps in parentheses.<br>
Leave point after open-paren.<br>
A negative ARG encloses the preceding ARG sexps instead.<br>
No argument is equivalent to zero: just insert `()' and leave point between.<br>
If `parens-require-spaces' is non-nil, this command also inserts a space<br>
before and after, depending on the surrounding characters.<br>
If region is active, insert enclosing characters at region boundaries.<br>
<br>
This command assumes point is not in a string or comment.</p>
