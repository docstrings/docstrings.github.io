<h3>Function: icalendar-import-buffer</h3>
<p>
Extract iCalendar events from current buffer.</p>
<p>
This function searches the current buffer for the first iCalendar
object, reads it and adds all VEVENT elements to the diary
DIARY-FILE.</p>
<p>
It will ask for each appointment whether to add it to the diary
unless DO-NOT-ASK is non-nil.  When called interactively,
DO-NOT-ASK is nil, so that you are asked for each event.</p>
<p>
NON-MARKING determines whether diary events are created as
non-marking.</p>
<p>
Return code t means that importing worked well, return code nil
means that an error has occurred.  Error messages will be in the
buffer `*icalendar-errors*'.</p>
