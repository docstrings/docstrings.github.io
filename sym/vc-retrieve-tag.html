<h3>Function: vc-retrieve-tag</h3>
<p>
Descending recursively from DIR, retrieve the tag called NAME.
If NAME is empty, it refers to the latest revisions.
If locking is used for the files in DIR, then there must not be any
locked files at or below DIR (but if NAME is empty, locked files are
allowed and simply skipped).</p>
