<h3>Function: vc-retrieve-tag</h3>
<p>
Descending recursively from DIR, retrieve the tag called NAME.<br>
If NAME is empty, it refers to the latest revisions.<br>
If locking is used for the files in DIR, then there must not be any<br>
locked files at or below DIR (but if NAME is empty, locked files are<br>
allowed and simply skipped).
