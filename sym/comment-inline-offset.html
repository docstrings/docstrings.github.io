<h3>Variable: comment-inline-offset</h3>
<p>
Inline comments have to be preceded by at least this many spaces.<br>
This is useful when style-conventions require a certain minimal offset.<br>
Python's PEP8 for example recommends two spaces, so you could do:<br>
<br>
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook<br>
   (lambda () (set (make-local-variable 'comment-inline-offset) 2)))<br>
<br>
See `comment-padding' for whole-line comments.</p>
