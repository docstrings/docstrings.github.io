<h3>Function: make-translation-table</h3>
<p>
Make a translation table from arguments.
A translation table is a char table intended for character
translation in CCL programs.</p>
<p>
Each argument is a list of elements of the form (FROM . TO), where FROM
is a character to be translated to TO.</p>
<p>
The arguments and forms in each argument are processed in the given
order, and if a previous form already translates TO to some other
character, say TO-ALT, FROM is also translated to TO-ALT.</p>
