<h3>Variable: Info-refill-paragraphs</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, attempt to refill paragraphs with hidden references.<br>
This refilling may accidentally remove explicit line breaks in the Info<br>
file, so be prepared for a few surprises if you enable this feature.<br>
This only has an effect if `Info-hide-note-references' is non-nil.</p>
