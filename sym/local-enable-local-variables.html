<h3>Variable: local-enable-local-variables</h3>
<p>
Like `enable-local-variables' but meant for buffer-local bindings.
The meaningful values are nil and non-nil.  The default is non-nil.
If a major mode sets this to nil, buffer-locally, then any local
variables list in a file visited in that mode will be ignored.</p>
<p>
This variable does not affect the use of major modes specified
in a -*- line.</p>
