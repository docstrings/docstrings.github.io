<h3>Variable: local-enable-local-variables</h3>
<p>
Like `enable-local-variables' but meant for buffer-local bindings.<br>
The meaningful values are nil and non-nil.  The default is non-nil.<br>
If a major mode sets this to nil, buffer-locally, then any local<br>
variables list in a file visited in that mode will be ignored.<br>
<br>
This variable does not affect the use of major modes specified
in a -*- line.</p>
