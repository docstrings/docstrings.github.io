<h3>Variable: last-coding-system-specified</h3>
<p>
Most recent coding system explicitly specified by the user when asked.
This variable is set whenever Emacs asks the user which coding system
to use in order to write a file.  If you set it to nil explicitly,
then call `write-region', then afterward this variable will be non-nil
only if the user was explicitly asked and specified a coding system.</p>
