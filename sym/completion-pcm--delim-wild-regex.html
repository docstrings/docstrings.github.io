<h3>Variable: completion-pcm--delim-wild-regex</h3>
<p>
Regular expression matching delimiters controlling the partial-completion.
Typically, this regular expression simply matches a delimiter, meaning
that completion can add something at (match-beginning 0), but if it has
a submatch 1, then completion can add something at (match-end 1).
This is used when the delimiter needs to be of size zero (e.g. the transition
from lowercase to uppercase characters).</p>
