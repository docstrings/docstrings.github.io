<h3>Function: vc-register</h3>
<p>
Register into a version control system.
If VC-FILESET is given, register the files in that fileset.
Otherwise register the current file.
With prefix argument SET-REVISION, allow user to specify initial revision
level.  If COMMENT is present, use that as an initial comment.</p>
<p>
The version control system to use is found by cycling through the list
`vc-handled-backends'.  The first backend in that list which declares
itself responsible for the file (usually because other files in that
directory are already registered under that backend) will be used to
register the file.  If no backend declares itself responsible, the
first backend that could register the file is used.</p>
