<h3>Variable: backup-by-copying-when-mismatch</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means create backups by copying if this preserves owner or group.<br>
Renaming may still be used (subject to control of other variables)<br>
when it would not result in changing the owner or group of the file;<br>
that is, for files which are owned by you and whose group matches<br>
the default for a new file created there by you.<br>
This variable is relevant only if `backup-by-copying' is nil.</p>
