<h3>Function: narrow-to-region</h3>
<p>
Restrict editing in this buffer to the current region.<br>
The rest of the text becomes temporarily invisible and untouchable<br>
but is not deleted; if you save the buffer in a file, the invisible<br>
text is included in the file.  C-x n w makes all visible again.<br>
See also `save-restriction'.<br>
<br>
When calling from a program, pass two arguments; positions (integers<br>
or markers) bounding the text that should remain visible.
