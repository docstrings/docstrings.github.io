<h3>Function: narrow-to-region</h3>
<p>
Restrict editing in this buffer to the current region.
The rest of the text becomes temporarily invisible and untouchable
but is not deleted; if you save the buffer in a file, the invisible
text is included in the file.  C-x n w makes all visible again.
See also `save-restriction'.</p>
<p>
When calling from a program, pass two arguments; positions (integers
or markers) bounding the text that should remain visible.</p>
