<h3>Function: handle-save-session</h3>
<p>
Handle the save_yourself event from a session manager.
A session manager can tell Emacs that the window system is shutting down
by sending Emacs a save_yourself message.  Emacs executes this function when
such an event occurs.  This function then executes `emacs-session-save'.
After that, this function informs the session manager that it can continue
or abort shutting down the window system depending on the return value
from `emacs-session-save'  If the return value is non-nil the session manager
is told to abort the window system shutdown.</p>
<p>
Do not call this function yourself.</p>
