<h3>Function: buffer-local-variables</h3>
<p>
Return an alist of variables that are buffer-local in BUFFER.<br>
Most elements look like (SYMBOL . VALUE), describing one variable.<br>
For a symbol that is locally unbound, just the symbol appears in the value.<br>
Note that storing new VALUEs in these elements doesn't change the variables.<br>
No argument or nil as argument means use current buffer as BUFFER.<br>
<br>
(fn &optional BUFFER)</p>
