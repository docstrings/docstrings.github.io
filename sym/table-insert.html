<h3>Function: table-insert</h3>
<p>
Insert an editable text table.
Insert a table of specified number of COLUMNS and ROWS.  Optional
parameter CELL-WIDTH and CELL-HEIGHT can specify the size of each
cell.  The cell size is uniform across the table if the specified size
is a number.  They can be a list of numbers to specify different size
for each cell.  When called interactively, the list of number is
entered by simply listing all the numbers with space characters
delimiting them.</p>
<p>
Examples:</p>
<p>
M-x table-insert inserts a table at the current point location.</p>
<p>
Suppose we have the following situation where `-!-' indicates the
location of point.</p>
<p>
    -!-</p>
<p>
Type M-x table-insert and hit ENTER key.  As it asks table
specification, provide 3 for number of columns, 1 for number of rows,
5 for cell width and 1 for cell height.  Now you shall see the next
table and the point is automatically moved to the beginning of the
first cell.</p>
<p>
    +-----+-----+-----+

<p>
Inside a table cell, there are special key bindings. 
Uses keymap `table-cell-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

M-9 M-x table-widen-cell (or C-u 9 M-x table-widen-cell) widens the first cell by 9 character
width, which results as</p>
<p>
    +--------------+-----+-----+
    |-!-           |     |     |
    +--------------+-----+-----+</p>
<p>
Type TAB M-x table-widen-cell then type TAB M-2 M-7 M-x table-widen-cell (or C-u 2 7 M-x table-widen-cell).  Typing
TAB moves the point forward by a cell. The result now looks like this:</p>
<p>
    +--------------+------+--------------------------------+
    |              |      |-!-                             |
    +--------------+------+--------------------------------+</p>
<p>
If you knew each width of the columns prior to the table creation,
what you could have done better was to have had given the complete
width information to `table-insert'.</p>
<p>
Cell width(s): 14 6 32</p>
<p>
instead of</p>
<p>
Cell width(s): 5</p>
<p>
This would have eliminated the previously mentioned width adjustment
work all together.</p>
<p>
If the point is in the last cell type S-TAB S-TAB to move it to the
first cell.  Now type M-x table-heighten-cell which heighten the row by a line.</p>
<p>

    +--------------+------+--------------------------------+</p>
<p>
Type M-x table-insert-row-column and tell it to insert a row.</p>
<p>
    +--------------+------+--------------------------------+
    |-!-           |      |                                |

<p>
Move the point under the table as shown below.</p>

    +--------------+------+--------------------------------+
    -!-</p>
<p>
Type M-x table-insert-row instead of M-x table-insert-row-column.  M-x table-insert-row-column does not work
when the point is outside of the table.  This insertion at
outside of the table effectively appends a row at the end.</p>
