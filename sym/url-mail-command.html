<h3>Variable: url-mail-command</h3>
<p>
This function will be called whenever URL needs to send mail.
It should enter a mail-mode-like buffer in the current window.
The commands `mail-to' and `mail-subject' should still work in this
buffer, and it should use `mail-header-separator' if possible.</p>
