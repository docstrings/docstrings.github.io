<h3>Function: current-fill-column</h3>
<p>
Return the fill-column to use for this line.<br>
The fill-column to use for a buffer is stored in the variable `fill-column',<br>
but can be locally modified by the `right-margin' text property, which is<br>
subtracted from `fill-column'.<br>
<br>
The fill column to use for a line is the first column at which the column<br>
number equals or exceeds the local fill-column - right-margin difference.</p>
