<h3>Variable: cl-custom-print-functions</h3>
<p>
This is a list of functions that format user objects for printing.<br>
Each function is called in turn with three arguments: the object, the<br>
stream, and the print level (currently ignored).  If it is able to<br>
print the object it returns true; otherwise it returns nil and the<br>
printer proceeds to the next function on the list.<br>
<br>
This variable is not used at present, but it is defined in hopes that<br>
a future Emacs interpreter will be able to use it.</p>
