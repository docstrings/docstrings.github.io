<h3>Function: macroexp--funcall-if-compiled</h3>
<p>
Pseudo function used internally by macroexp to delay warnings.
The purpose is to delay warnings to bytecomp.el, so they can use things
like `byte-compile-log-warning' to get better file-and-line-number data
and also to avoid outputting the warning during normal execution.</p>
