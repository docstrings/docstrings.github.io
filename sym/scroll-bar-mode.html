<h3>Function: scroll-bar-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle vertical scroll bars on all frames (Scroll Bar mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Scroll Bar mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
This command applies to all frames that exist and frames to be
created in the future.</p>
<h3>Variable: scroll-bar-mode</h3>
<p>
Specify whether to have vertical scroll bars, and on which side.
Possible values are nil (no scroll bars), `left' (scroll bars on left)
and `right' (scroll bars on right).
To set this variable in a Lisp program, use `set-scroll-bar-mode'
to make it take real effect.
Setting the variable with a customization buffer also takes effect.</p>
