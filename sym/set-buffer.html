<h3>Function: set-buffer</h3>
<p>
Make buffer BUFFER-OR-NAME current for editing operations.
BUFFER-OR-NAME may be a buffer or the name of an existing buffer.  See
also `with-current-buffer' when you want to make a buffer current
temporarily.  This function does not display the buffer, so its effect
ends when the current command terminates.  Use `switch-to-buffer' or
`pop-to-buffer' to switch buffers permanently.</p>
