<h3>Function: format-mode-line</h3>
<p>
Format a string out of a mode line format specification.
First arg FORMAT specifies the mode line format (see `mode-line-format'
for details) to use.</p>
<p>
By default, the format is evaluated for the currently selected window.</p>
<p>
Optional second arg FACE specifies the face property to put on all
characters for which no face is specified.  The value nil means the
default face.  The value t means whatever face the window's mode line
currently uses (either `mode-line' or `mode-line-inactive',
depending on whether the window is the selected window or not).
An integer value means the value string has no text
properties.</p>
<p>
Optional third and fourth args WINDOW and BUFFER specify the window
and buffer to use as the context for the formatting (defaults
are the selected window and the WINDOW's buffer).</p>
