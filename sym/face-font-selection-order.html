<h3>Variable: face-font-selection-order</h3>
<p>
A list specifying how face font selection chooses fonts.
Each of the four symbols `:width', `:height', `:weight', and `:slant'
must appear once in the list, and the list must not contain any other
elements.  Font selection first tries to find a best matching font
for those face attributes that appear before in the list.  For
example, if `:slant' appears before `:height', font selection first
tries to find a font with a suitable slant, even if this results in
a font height that isn't optimal.</p>
