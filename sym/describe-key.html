<h3>Function: describe-key</h3>
<p>
Display documentation of the function invoked by KEY.
KEY can be any kind of a key sequence; it can include keyboard events,
mouse events, and/or menu events.  When calling from a program,
pass KEY as a string or a vector.</p>
<p>
If non-nil, UNTRANSLATED is a vector of the corresponding untranslated events.
It can also be a number, in which case the untranslated events from
the last key sequence entered are used.
UP-EVENT is the up-event that was discarded by reading KEY, or nil.</p>

If KEY is a menu item or a tool-bar button that is disabled, this command
temporarily enables it to allow getting help on disabled items and buttons.</p>
