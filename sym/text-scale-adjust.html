<h3>Function: text-scale-adjust</h3>
<p>
Adjust the height of the default face by INC.</p>
<p>
INC may be passed as a numeric prefix argument.</p>
<p>
The actual adjustment made depends on the final component of the
key-binding used to invoke the command, with all modifiers removed:</p>
<p>
   +, =   Increase the default face height by one step
   -      Decrease the default face height by one step
   0      Reset the default face height to the global default</p>
<p>
When adjusting with `+' or `-', continue to read input events and
further adjust the face height as long as the input event read
(with all modifiers removed) is `+' or `-'.</p>
<p>
When adjusting with `0', immediately finish.</p>
<p>
Each step scales the height of the default face by the variable
`text-scale-mode-step' (a negative number of steps decreases the
height by the same amount).  As a special case, an argument of 0
will remove any scaling currently active.</p>
<p>
This command is a special-purpose wrapper around the
`text-scale-increase' command which makes repetition convenient
even when it is bound in a non-top-level keymap.  For binding in
a top-level keymap, `text-scale-increase' or
`text-scale-decrease' may be more appropriate.</p>
