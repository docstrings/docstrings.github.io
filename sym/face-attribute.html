<h3>Function: face-attribute</h3>
<p>
Return the value of FACE's ATTRIBUTE on FRAME.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.</p>
<p>
If INHERIT is nil, only attributes directly defined by FACE are considered,
  so the return value may be `unspecified', or a relative value.
If INHERIT is non-nil, FACE's definition of ATTRIBUTE is merged with the
  faces specified by its `:inherit' attribute; however the return value
  may still be `unspecified' or relative.
If INHERIT is a face or a list of faces, then the result is further merged
  with that face (or faces), until it becomes specified and absolute.</p>
<p>
To ensure that the return value is always specified and absolute, use a
value of `default' for INHERIT; this will resolve any unspecified or
relative values by merging with the `default' face (which is always
completely specified).</p>
