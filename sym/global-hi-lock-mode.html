<h3>Function: global-hi-lock-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle Hi-Lock mode in all buffers.
With prefix ARG, enable Global-Hi-Lock mode if ARG is positive;
otherwise, disable it.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode if
ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Hi-Lock mode is enabled in all buffers where
`turn-on-hi-lock-if-enabled' would do it.
See `hi-lock-mode' for more information on Hi-Lock mode.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)</p>
<h3>Variable: global-hi-lock-mode</h3>
<p>
Non-nil if Global-Hi-Lock mode is enabled.
See the command `global-hi-lock-mode' for a description of this minor mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')
or call the function `global-hi-lock-mode'.</p>
