<h3>Variable: view-no-disable-on-exit</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, View mode "exit" commands don't actually disable View mode.<br>
Instead, these commands just switch buffers or windows.<br>
This is set in certain buffers by specialized features such as help commands<br>
that use View mode automatically.</p>
