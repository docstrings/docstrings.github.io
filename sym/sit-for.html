<h3>Function: sit-for</h3>
<p>
Perform redisplay, then wait for SECONDS seconds or until input is available.
SECONDS may be a floating-point value.
(On operating systems that do not support waiting for fractions of a
second, floating-point values are rounded down to the nearest integer.)</p>
<p>
If optional arg NODISP is t, don't redisplay, just wait for input.
Redisplay does not happen if input is available before it starts.</p>
<p>
Value is t if waited the full time with no input arriving, and nil otherwise.</p>
<p>
An obsolete, but still supported form is
(sit-for SECONDS &optional MILLISECONDS NODISP)
where the optional arg MILLISECONDS specifies an additional wait period,
in milliseconds; this was useful when Emacs was built without
floating point support.</p>
