<h3>Function: read-char-by-name</h3>
<p>
Read a character by its Unicode name or hex number string.<br>
Display PROMPT and read a string that represents a character by its<br>
Unicode property `name' or `old-name'.<br>
<br>
This function returns the character as a number.<br>
<br>
You can type a few of the first letters of the Unicode name and<br>
use completion.  If you type a substring of the Unicode name<br>
preceded by an asterisk `*' and use completion, it will show all<br>
the characters whose names include that substring, not necessarily<br>
at the beginning of the name.<br>
<br>
This function also accepts a hexadecimal number of Unicode code<br>
point or a number in hash notation, e.g. #o21430 for octal,
#x2318 for hex, or #10r8984 for decimal.</p>
