<h3>Variable: file-name-handler-alist</h3>
<p>
Alist of elements (REGEXP . HANDLER) for file names handled specially.<br>
If a file name matches REGEXP, all I/O on that file is done by calling<br>
HANDLER.  If a file name matches more than one handler, the handler<br>
whose match starts last in the file name gets precedence.  The<br>
function `find-file-name-handler' checks this list for a handler for<br>
its argument.<br>
<br>
HANDLER should be a function.  The first argument given to it is the<br>
name of the I/O primitive to be handled; the remaining arguments are<br>
the arguments that were passed to that primitive.  For example, if you<br>
do (file-exists-p FILENAME) and FILENAME is handled by HANDLER, then<br>
HANDLER is called like this:<br>
<br>
  (funcall HANDLER 'file-exists-p FILENAME)<br>
<br>
Note that HANDLER must be able to handle all I/O primitives; if it has<br>
nothing special to do for a primitive, it should reinvoke the<br>
primitive to handle the operation "the usual way".
