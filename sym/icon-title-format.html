<h3>Variable: icon-title-format</h3>
<p>
Template for displaying the title bar of an iconified frame.
(Assuming the window manager supports this feature.)
This variable has the same structure as `mode-line-format' (which see),
and is used only on frames for which no explicit name has been set
(see `modify-frame-parameters').</p>
