<h3>Function: help-buffer</h3>
<p>
Return the name of a buffer for inserting help.
If `help-xref-following' is non-nil, this is the name of the
current buffer.  Signal an error if this buffer is not derived
from `help-mode'.
Otherwise, return "*Help*", creating a buffer with that name if
it does not already exist.</p>
