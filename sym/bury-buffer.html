<h3>Function: bury-buffer</h3>
<p>
Put BUFFER-OR-NAME at the end of the list of all buffers.
There it is the least likely candidate for `other-buffer' to
return; thus, the least likely buffer for C-x b to
select by default.</p>
<p>
You can specify a buffer name as BUFFER-OR-NAME, or an actual
buffer object.  If BUFFER-OR-NAME is nil or omitted, bury the
current buffer.  Also, if BUFFER-OR-NAME is nil or omitted,
remove the current buffer from the selected window if it is
displayed there.</p>
