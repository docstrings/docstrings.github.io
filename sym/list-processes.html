<h3>Function: list-processes</h3>
<p>
Display a list of all processes.
If optional argument QUERY-ONLY is non-nil, only processes with
the query-on-exit flag set are listed.
Any process listed as exited or signaled is actually eliminated
after the listing is made.
Optional argument BUFFER specifies a buffer to use, instead of
"*Process List*".
The return value is always nil.</p>
