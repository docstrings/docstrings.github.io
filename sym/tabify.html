<h3>Function: tabify</h3>
<p>
Convert multiple spaces in region to tabs when possible.<br>
A group of spaces is partially replaced by tabs<br>
when this can be done without changing the column they end at.<br>
Called non-interactively, the region is specified by arguments<br>
START and END, rather than by the position of point and mark.<br>
The variable `tab-width' controls the spacing of tab stops.
