<h3>Variable: after-revert-hook</h3>
<p>
Normal hook for `revert-buffer' to run after reverting.
Note that the hook value that it runs is the value that was in effect
before reverting; that makes a difference if you have buffer-local
hook functions.</p>
<p>
If `revert-buffer-function' is used to override the normal revert
mechanism, this hook is not used.</p>
