<h3>Variable: after-revert-hook</h3>
<p>
Normal hook for `revert-buffer' to run after reverting.<br>
Note that the hook value that it runs is the value that was in effect<br>
before reverting; that makes a difference if you have buffer-local<br>
hook functions.<br>
<br>
If `revert-buffer-function' is used to override the normal revert<br>
mechanism, this hook is not used.</p>
