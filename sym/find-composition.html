<h3>Function: find-composition</h3>
<p>
Return information about a composition at or near buffer position POS.</p>
<p>
If the character at POS has `composition' property, the value is a list
(FROM TO VALID-P).</p>
<p>
FROM and TO specify the range of text that has the same `composition'
property, VALID-P is t if this composition is valid, and nil if not.</p>
<p>
If there's no composition at POS, and the optional 2nd argument LIMIT
is non-nil, search for a composition toward the position given by LIMIT.</p>
<p>
If no composition is found, return nil.</p>
<p>
Optional 3rd argument STRING, if non-nil, is a string to look for a
composition in; nil means the current buffer.</p>
<p>
If a valid composition is found and the optional 4th argument DETAIL-P
is non-nil, the return value is a list of the form</p>
<p>
   (FROM TO COMPONENTS RELATIVE-P MOD-FUNC WIDTH)</p>
<p>
COMPONENTS is a vector of integers, the meaning depends on RELATIVE-P.</p>
<p>
RELATIVE-P is t if the composition method is relative, else nil.</p>
<p>
If RELATIVE-P is t, COMPONENTS is a vector of characters to be
composed.  If RELATIVE-P is nil, COMPONENTS is a vector of characters
and composition rules as described in `compose-region'.</p>
<p>
MOD-FUNC is a modification function of the composition.</p>
<p>
WIDTH is a number of columns the composition occupies on the screen.</p>
<p>
When Automatic Composition mode is on, this function also finds a
chunk of text that is automatically composed.  If such a chunk is
found closer to POS than the position that has `composition'
property, the value is a list of FROM, TO, and a glyph-string
that specifies how the chunk is to be composed.  See the function
`composition-get-gstring' for the format of the glyph-string.</p>
