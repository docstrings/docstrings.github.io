<h3>Function: add-minor-mode</h3>
<p>
Register a new minor mode.</p>
<p>
This is an XEmacs-compatibility function.  Use `define-minor-mode' instead.</p>
<p>
TOGGLE is a symbol which is the name of a buffer-local variable that
is toggled on or off to say whether the minor mode is active or not.</p>
<p>
NAME specifies what will appear in the mode line when the minor mode
is active.  NAME should be either a string starting with a space, or a
symbol whose value is such a string.</p>
<p>
Optional KEYMAP is the keymap for the minor mode that will be added
to `minor-mode-map-alist'.</p>
<p>
Optional AFTER specifies that TOGGLE should be added after AFTER
in `minor-mode-alist'.</p>
<p>
Optional TOGGLE-FUN is an interactive function to toggle the mode.
It defaults to (and should by convention be) TOGGLE.</p>
<p>
If TOGGLE has a non-nil `:included' property, an entry for the mode is
included in the mode-line minor mode menu.
If TOGGLE has a `:menu-tag', that is used for the menu item's label.</p>
