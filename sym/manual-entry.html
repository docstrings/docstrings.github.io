<h3>Function: manual-entry</h3>
<p>
Get a Un*x manual page and put it in a buffer.
This command is the top-level command in the man package.  It
runs a Un*x command to retrieve and clean a manpage in the
background and places the results in a `Man-mode' browsing
buffer.  See variable `Man-notify-method' for what happens when
the buffer is ready.  If a buffer already exists for this man
page, it will display immediately.</p>
<p>
For a manpage from a particular section, use either of the
following.  "cat(1)" is how cross-references appear and is
passed to man as "1 cat".</p>
<p>
    cat(1)
    1 cat</p>
<p>
To see manpages from all sections related to a subject, use an
"all pages" option (which might be "-a" if it's not the
default), then step through with `Man-next-manpage' (
Uses keymap `Man-mode-map', which is not currently defined.
M-x Man-next-manpage) etc.
Add to `Man-switches' to make this option permanent.</p>
<p>
    -a chmod</p>
<p>
An explicit filename can be given too.  Use -l if it might
otherwise look like a page name.</p>
<p>
    /my/file/name.1.gz
    -l somefile.1</p>
<p>
An "apropos" query with -k gives a buffer of matching page
names or descriptions.  The pattern argument is usually an
"egrep" style regexp.</p>
<p>
    -k pattern</p>
