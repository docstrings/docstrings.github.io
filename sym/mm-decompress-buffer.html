<h3>Function: mm-decompress-buffer</h3>
<p>
Decompress buffer's contents, depending on jka-compr.<br>
Only when FORCE is t or `auto-compression-mode' is enabled and FILENAME<br>
agrees with `jka-compr-compression-info-list', decompression is done.<br>
Signal an error if FORCE is neither nil nor t and compressed data are<br>
not decompressed because `auto-compression-mode' is disabled.<br>
If INPLACE is nil, return decompressed data or nil without modifying<br>
the buffer.  Otherwise, replace the buffer's contents with the<br>
decompressed data.  The buffer's multibyteness must be turned off.</p>
