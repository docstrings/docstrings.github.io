<h3>Function: goto-line</h3>
<p>
Go to LINE, counting from line 1 at beginning of buffer.
If called interactively, a numeric prefix argument specifies
LINE; without a numeric prefix argument, read LINE from the
minibuffer.</p>
<p>
If optional argument BUFFER is non-nil, switch to that buffer and
move to line LINE there.  If called interactively with C-u
as argument, BUFFER is the most recently selected other buffer.</p>
<p>
Prior to moving point, this function sets the mark (without
activating it), unless Transient Mark mode is enabled and the
mark is already active.</p>
<p>
This function is usually the wrong thing to use in a Lisp program.
What you probably want instead is something like:
  (goto-char (point-min))
  (forward-line (1- N))
If at all possible, an even better solution is to use char counts
rather than line counts.</p>
