<h3>Variable: face-remapping-alist</h3>
<p>
Alist of face remappings.
Each element is of the form:</p>
<p>
   (FACE . REPLACEMENT),</p>
<p>
which causes display of the face FACE to use REPLACEMENT instead.
REPLACEMENT is a face specification, i.e. one of the following:</p>
<p>
  (1) a face name
  (2) a property list of attribute/value pairs, or
  (3) a list in which each element has the form of (1) or (2).</p>
<p>
List values for REPLACEMENT are merged to form the final face
specification, with earlier entries taking precedence, in the same as
as in the `face' text property.</p>
<p>
Face-name remapping cycles are suppressed; recursive references use
the underlying face instead of the remapped face.  So a remapping of
the form:</p>
<p>
   (FACE EXTRA-FACE... FACE)</p>
<p>
or:</p>
<p>
   (FACE (FACE-ATTR VAL ...) FACE)</p>
<p>
causes EXTRA-FACE... or (FACE-ATTR VAL ...) to be _merged_ with the
existing definition of FACE.  Note that this isn't necessary for the
default face, since every face inherits from the default face.</p>
<p>
If this variable is made buffer-local, the face remapping takes effect
only in that buffer.  For instance, the mode my-mode could define a
face `my-mode-default', and then in the mode setup function, do:</p>
<p>
   (set (make-local-variable 'face-remapping-alist)
	'((default my-mode-default)))).</p>
<p>
Because Emacs normally only redraws screen areas when the underlying
buffer contents change, you may need to call `redraw-display' after
changing this variable for it to take effect.</p>
