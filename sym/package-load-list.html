<h3>Variable: package-load-list</h3>
<p>
List of packages for `package-initialize' to load.<br>
Each element in this list should be a list (NAME VERSION), or the<br>
symbol `all'.  The symbol `all' says to load the latest installed<br>
versions of all packages not specified by other elements.<br>
<br>
For an element (NAME VERSION), NAME is a package name (a symbol).<br>
VERSION should be t, a string, or nil.<br>
If VERSION is t, all versions are loaded, though obsolete ones<br>
 will be put in `package-obsolete-alist' and not activated.<br>
If VERSION is a string, only that version is ever loaded.<br>
 Any other version, even if newer, is silently ignored.<br>
 Hence, the package is "held" at that version.<br>
If VERSION is nil, the package is not loaded (it is "disabled").</p>
