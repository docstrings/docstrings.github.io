<h3>Variable: mouse-highlight</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, clickable text is highlighted when mouse is over it.<br>
If the value is an integer, highlighting is only shown after moving the<br>
mouse, while keyboard input turns off the highlight even when the mouse<br>
is over the clickable text.  However, the mouse shape still indicates<br>
when the mouse is over clickable text.</p>
