<h3>Function: idlwave-shell</h3>
<p>
Run an inferior IDL, with I/O through buffer `(idlwave-shell-buffer)'.
If buffer exists but shell process is not running, start new IDL.
If buffer exists and shell process is running, just switch to the buffer.</p>
<p>
When called with a prefix ARG, or when `idlwave-shell-use-dedicated-frame'
is non-nil, the shell buffer and the source buffers will be in
separate frames.</p>
<p>
The command to run comes from variable `idlwave-shell-explicit-file-name',
with options taken from `idlwave-shell-command-line-options'.</p>
<p>
The buffer is put in `idlwave-shell-mode', providing commands for sending
input and controlling the IDL job.  See help on `idlwave-shell-mode'.
See also the variable `idlwave-shell-prompt-pattern'.</p>
<p>
(Type C-h m in the shell buffer for a list of commands.)</p>
