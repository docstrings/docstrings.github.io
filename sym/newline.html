<h3>Function: newline</h3>
<p>
Insert a newline, and move to left margin of the new line if it's blank.
If `use-hard-newlines' is non-nil, the newline is marked with the
text-property `hard'.
With ARG, insert that many newlines.
Call `auto-fill-function' if the current column number is greater
than the value of `fill-column' and ARG is nil.</p>
