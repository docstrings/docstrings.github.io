<h3>Function: font-lock-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle syntax highlighting in this buffer (Font Lock mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Font Lock mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When Font Lock mode is enabled, text is fontified as you type it:</p>
<p>
 - Comments are displayed in `font-lock-comment-face';
 - Strings are displayed in `font-lock-string-face';
 - Certain other expressions are displayed in other faces according to the
   value of the variable `font-lock-keywords'.</p>
<p>
To customize the faces (colors, fonts, etc.) used by Font Lock for
fontifying different parts of buffer text, use M-x customize-face.</p>
<p>
You can enable Font Lock mode in any major mode automatically by turning on in
the major mode's hook.  For example, put in your ~/.emacs:</p>
<p>
 (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you can use Global Font Lock mode to automagically turn on Font
Lock mode in buffers whose major mode supports it and whose major mode is one
of `font-lock-global-modes'.  For example, put in your ~/.emacs:</p>
<p>
 (global-font-lock-mode t)</p>
<p>
Where major modes support different levels of fontification, you can use
the variable `font-lock-maximum-decoration' to specify which level you
generally prefer.  When you turn Font Lock mode on/off the buffer is
fontified/defontified, though fontification occurs only if the buffer is
less than `font-lock-maximum-size'.</p>
<p>
To add your own highlighting for some major mode, and modify the highlighting
selected automatically via the variable `font-lock-maximum-decoration', you can
use `font-lock-add-keywords'.</p>
<p>
To fontify a buffer, without turning on Font Lock mode and regardless of buffer
size, you can use M-x font-lock-fontify-buffer.</p>
<p>
To fontify a block (the function or paragraph containing point, or a number of
lines around point), perhaps because modification on the current line caused
syntactic change on other lines, you can use M-o M-o.</p>
<p>
You can set your own default settings for some mode, by setting a
buffer local value for `font-lock-defaults', via its mode hook.</p>
<p>
The above is the default behavior of `font-lock-mode'; you may specify
your own function which is called when `font-lock-mode' is toggled via
`font-lock-function'. </p>
<h3>Variable: font-lock-mode</h3>
<p>
Non-nil if Font-Lock mode is enabled.
Use the command `font-lock-mode' to change this variable.</p>
