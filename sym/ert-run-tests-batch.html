<h3>Function: ert-run-tests-batch</h3>
<p>
Run the tests specified by SELECTOR, printing results to the terminal.<br>
<br>
SELECTOR works as described in `ert-select-tests', except if<br>
SELECTOR is nil, in which case all tests rather than none will be<br>
run; this makes the command line "emacs -batch -l my-tests.el -f<br>
ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit" useful.<br>
<br>
Returns the stats object.

(fn &optional SELECTOR)</p>
