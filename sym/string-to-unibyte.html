<h3>Function: string-to-unibyte</h3>
<p>
Return a unibyte string with the same individual chars as STRING.
If STRING is unibyte, the result is STRING itself.
Otherwise it is a newly created string, with no text properties,
where each `eight-bit' character is converted to the corresponding byte.
If STRING contains a non-ASCII, non-`eight-bit' character,
an error is signaled.</p>
