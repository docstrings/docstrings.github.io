<h3>Function: password-cache-remove</h3>
<p>
Remove password indexed by KEY from password cache.
This is typically run by a timer setup from `password-cache-add',
but can be invoked at any time to forcefully remove passwords
from the cache.  This may be useful when it has been detected
that a password is invalid, so that `password-read' query the
user again.</p>
