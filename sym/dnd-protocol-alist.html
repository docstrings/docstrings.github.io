<h3>Variable: dnd-protocol-alist</h3>
<p>
The functions to call for different protocols when a drop is made.<br>
This variable is used by `dnd-handle-one-url' and `dnd-handle-file-name'.<br>
The list contains of (REGEXP . FUNCTION) pairs.<br>
The functions shall take two arguments, URL, which is the URL dropped and<br>
ACTION which is the action to be performed for the drop (move, copy, link,<br>
private or ask).<br>
If no match is found here, and the value of `browse-url-browser-function'<br>
is a pair of (REGEXP . FUNCTION), those regexps are tried for a match.<br>
If no match is found, the URL is inserted as text by calling `dnd-insert-text'.<br>
The function shall return the action done (move, copy, link or private)<br>
if some action was made, or nil if the URL is ignored.</p>
