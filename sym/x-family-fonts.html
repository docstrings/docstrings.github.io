<h3>Function: x-family-fonts</h3>
<p>
Return a list of available fonts of family FAMILY on FRAME.
If FAMILY is omitted or nil, list all families.
Otherwise, FAMILY must be a string, possibly containing wildcards
`?' and `*'.

FAMILY is the font family name.  POINT-SIZE is the size of the
font in 1/10 pt.  WIDTH, WEIGHT, and SLANT are symbols describing the
width, weight and slant of the font.  These symbols are the same as for
face attributes.  FIXED-P is non-nil if the font is fixed-pitch.
FULL is the full name of the font, and REGISTRY-AND-ENCODING is a string
giving the registry and encoding of the font.
The result list is sorted according to the current setting of
