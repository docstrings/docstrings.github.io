<h3>Variable: sh-leading-keywords</h3>
<p>
List of keywords that may be immediately followed by a builtin or keyword.<br>
Given some confusion between keywords and builtins depending on shell and<br>
system, the distinction here has been based on whether they influence the<br>
flow of control or syntax.  See `sh-feature'.</p>
