<h3>Function: facemenu-read-color</h3>
<p>
Read a color name or RGB triplet.
Completion is available for color names, but not for RGB triplets.</p>
<p>
RGB triplets have the form "#RRGGBB".  Each of the R, G, and B
components can have one to four digits, but all three components
must have the same number of digits.  Each digit is a hex value
between 0 and F; either upper case or lower case for A through F
are acceptable.</p>
<p>
In addition to standard color names and RGB hex values, the
following are available as color candidates.  In each case, the
corresponding color is used.</p>
<p>
 * `foreground at point'   - foreground under the cursor
 * `background at point'   - background under the cursor</p>
<p>
Optional arg PROMPT is the prompt; if nil, use a default prompt.</p>
<p>
Interactively, or with optional arg CONVERT-TO-RGB-P non-nil,
convert an input color name to an RGB hex string.  Return the RGB
hex string.</p>
<p>
If optional arg ALLOW-EMPTY-NAME is non-nil, the user is allowed
to enter an empty color name (the empty string).</p>
<p>
Interactively, or with optional arg MSG non-nil, print the
resulting color name in the echo area.</p>
