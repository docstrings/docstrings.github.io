<h3>Variable: sh-here-document-word</h3>
<p>
Word to delimit here documents.<br>
If the first character of this string is "-", this is taken as<br>
part of the redirection operator, rather than part of the<br>
word (that is, "<<-" instead of "<<").  This is a feature<br>
used by some shells (for example Bash) to indicate that leading<br>
tabs inside the here document should be ignored.  In this case,<br>
Emacs indents the initial body and end of the here document with<br>
tabs, to the same level as the start (note that apart from this<br>
there is no support for indentation of here documents).  This<br>
will only work correctly if `sh-basic-offset' is a multiple of<br>
`tab-width'.<br>
<br>
Any quote characters or leading whitespace in the word are
removed when closing the here document.</p>
