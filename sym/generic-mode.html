<h3>Function: generic-mode</h3>
<p>
Enter generic mode MODE.</p>
<p>
Generic modes provide basic comment and font-lock functionality
for "generic" files.  (Files which are too small to warrant their
own mode, but have comment characters, keywords, and the like.)</p>
<p>
To define a generic-mode, use the function `define-generic-mode'.
Some generic modes are defined in `generic-x.el'.</p>
<p>
(fn MODE)</p>
