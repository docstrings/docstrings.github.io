<h3>Function: generic-mode</h3>
<p>
Enter generic mode MODE.<br>
<br>
Generic modes provide basic comment and font-lock functionality<br>
for "generic" files.  (Files which are too small to warrant their<br>
own mode, but have comment characters, keywords, and the like.)<br>
<br>
To define a generic-mode, use the function `define-generic-mode'.<br>
Some generic modes are defined in `generic-x.el'.
