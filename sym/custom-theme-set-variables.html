<h3>Function: custom-theme-set-variables</h3>
<p>
Initialize variables for theme THEME according to settings in ARGS.
Each of the arguments in ARGS should be a list of this form:</p>
<p>
  (SYMBOL EXP [NOW [REQUEST [COMMENT]]])</p>
<p>
SYMBOL is the variable name, and EXP is an expression which
evaluates to the customized value.  EXP will also be stored,
without evaluating it, in SYMBOL's `saved-value' property, so
that it can be restored via the Customize interface.  It is also
added to the alist in SYMBOL's `theme-value' property (by
calling `custom-push-theme').</p>
<p>
NOW, if present and non-nil, means to install the variable's
value directly now, even if its `defcustom' declaration has not
been executed.  This is for internal use only.</p>
<p>
REQUEST is a list of features to `require' (which are loaded
prior to evaluating EXP).</p>
<p>
COMMENT is a comment string about SYMBOL.</p>
