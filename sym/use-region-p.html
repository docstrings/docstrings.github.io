<h3>Function: use-region-p</h3>
<p>
Return t if the region is active and it is appropriate to act on it.
This is used by commands that act specially on the region under
Transient Mark mode.</p>
<p>
The return value is t if Transient Mark mode is enabled and the
mark is active; furthermore, if `use-empty-active-region' is nil,
the region must not be empty.  Otherwise, the return value is nil.</p>
<p>
For some commands, it may be appropriate to ignore the value of
`use-empty-active-region'; in that case, use `region-active-p'.</p>
