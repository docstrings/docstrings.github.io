<h3>Function: comment-add</h3>
<p>
Compute the number of extra comment starter characters.<br>
(Extra semicolons in Lisp mode, extra stars in C mode, etc.)<br>
If ARG is non-nil, just follow ARG.<br>
If the comment starter is multi-char, just follow ARG.<br>
Otherwise obey `comment-add'.

(fn ARG)</p>
<h3>Variable: comment-add</h3>
<p>
How many more comment chars should be inserted by `comment-region'.<br>
This determines the default value of the numeric argument of `comment-region'.<br>
The `plain' comment style doubles this value.<br>
<br>
This should generally stay 0, except for a few modes like Lisp where<br>
it is 1 so that regions are commented with two or three semi-colons.</p>
