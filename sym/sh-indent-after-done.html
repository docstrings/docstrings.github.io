<h3>Variable: sh-indent-after-done</h3>
<p>
How much to indent a statement after a `done' keyword.<br>
Normally this is 0, which aligns the `done' to the matching<br>
looping construct line.<br>
Setting it non-zero allows you to have the `do' statement on a line<br>
by itself and align the done under to do.</p>
