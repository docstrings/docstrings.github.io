<h3>Function: replace-quote</h3>
<p>
Quote a replacement string.
This just doubles all backslashes in REPLACEMENT and
returns the resulting string.  If REPLACEMENT is not
a string, it is first passed through `prin1-to-string'
with the `noescape' argument set.</p>
<p>
`match-data' is preserved across the call.</p>
