<h3>Function: sieve-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for editing Sieve code.
This is much like C mode except for the syntax of comments.  Its keymap
inherits from C mode's and it has the same variables for customizing
indentation.  It has its own abbrev table and its own syntax table.</p>
<p>
Turning on Sieve mode runs `sieve-mode-hook'.</p>
