<h3>Function: indirect-variable</h3>
<p>
Return the variable at the end of OBJECT's variable chain.
If OBJECT is a symbol, follow its variable indirections (if any), and
return the variable at the end of the chain of aliases.  See Info node
`(elisp)Variable Aliases'.</p>
<p>
If OBJECT is not a symbol, just return it.  If there is a loop in the
chain of aliases, signal a `cyclic-variable-indirection' error.</p>
