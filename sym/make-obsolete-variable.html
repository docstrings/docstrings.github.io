<h3>Function: make-obsolete-variable</h3>
<p>
Make the byte-compiler warn that OBSOLETE-NAME is obsolete.
The warning will say that CURRENT-NAME should be used instead.
If CURRENT-NAME is a string, that is the `use instead' message.
WHEN should be a string indicating when the variable
was first made obsolete, for example a date or a release number.
ACCESS-TYPE if non-nil should specify the kind of access that will trigger
  obsolescence warnings; it can be either `get' or `set'.</p>
