<h3>Function: eval-buffer</h3>
<p>
Execute the current buffer as Lisp code.
When called from a Lisp program (i.e., not interactively), this
function accepts up to five optional arguments:
BUFFER is the buffer to evaluate (nil means use current buffer).
PRINTFLAG controls printing of output:
 A value of nil means discard it; anything else is stream for print.
FILENAME specifies the file name to use for `load-history'.
UNIBYTE, if non-nil, specifies `load-convert-to-unibyte' for this
 invocation.
DO-ALLOW-PRINT, if non-nil, specifies that `print' and related
 functions should work normally even if PRINTFLAG is nil.</p>
<p>
This function preserves the position of point.</p>
