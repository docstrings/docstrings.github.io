<h3>Function: quail-set-keyboard-layout</h3>
<p>
Set the current keyboard layout to the same as keyboard KBD-TYPE.</p>
<p>
Since some Quail packages depends on a physical layout of keys (not
characters generated by them), those are created by assuming the
standard layout defined in `quail-keyboard-layout-standard'.  This
function tells Quail system the layout of your keyboard so that what
you type is correctly handled.</p>
