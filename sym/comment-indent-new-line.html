<h3>Function: comment-indent-new-line</h3>
<p>
Break line at point and indent, continuing comment if within one.
This indents the body of the continued comment
under the previous comment line.</p>
<p>
This command is intended for styles where you write a comment per line,
starting a new comment (and terminating it if necessary) on each line.
If you want to continue one comment across several lines, use C-j.</p>
<p>
If a fill column is specified, it overrides the use of the comment column
or comment indentation.</p>
<p>
The inserted newline is marked hard if variable `use-hard-newlines' is true,
unless optional argument SOFT is non-nil.</p>
