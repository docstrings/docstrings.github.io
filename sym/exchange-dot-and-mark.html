<h3>Function: exchange-dot-and-mark</h3>
<p>
Put the mark where point is now, and point where the mark is now.
This command works even when the mark is not active,
and it reactivates the mark.</p>
<p>
If Transient Mark mode is on, a prefix ARG deactivates the mark
if it is active, and otherwise avoids reactivating it.  If
Transient Mark mode is off, a prefix ARG enables Transient Mark
mode temporarily.</p>
