<h3>Variable: inhibit-null-byte-detection</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, Emacs ignores null bytes on code detection.
By default, Emacs treats it as binary data, and does not attempt to
decode it.  The effect is as if you specified `no-conversion' for
reading that text.</p>
<p>
Set this to non-nil when a regular text happens to include null bytes.
Examples are Index nodes of Info files and null-byte delimited output
from GNU Find and GNU Grep.  Emacs will then ignore the null bytes and
decode text as usual.</p>
