<h3>Function: ps-print-buffer</h3>
<p>
Generate and print a PostScript image of the buffer.<br>
<br>
Interactively, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the<br>
user for a file name, and saves the PostScript image in that file instead of<br>
sending it to the printer.<br>
<br>
Noninteractively, the argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it is nil,<br>
send the image to the printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save the PostScript<br>
image in a file with that name.

(fn &optional FILENAME)</p>
