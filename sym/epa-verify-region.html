<h3>Function: epa-verify-region</h3>
<p>
Verify the current region between START and END.<br>
<br>
Don't use this command in Lisp programs!<br>
Since this function operates on regions, it does some tricks such<br>
as coding-system detection and unibyte/multibyte conversion.  If<br>
you are sure how the data in the region should be treated, you<br>
should consider using the string based counterpart<br>
`epg-verify-string', or the file based counterpart<br>
`epg-verify-file' instead.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
(let ((context (epg-make-context 'OpenPGP)))<br>
  (decode-coding-string<br>
    (epg-verify-string context (buffer-substring start end))
    'utf-8))

(fn START END)</p>
