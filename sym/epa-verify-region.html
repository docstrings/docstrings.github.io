<h3>Function: epa-verify-region</h3>
<p>
Verify the current region between START and END.</p>
<p>
Don't use this command in Lisp programs!
Since this function operates on regions, it does some tricks such
as coding-system detection and unibyte/multibyte conversion.  If
you are sure how the data in the region should be treated, you
should consider using the string based counterpart
`epg-verify-string', or the file based counterpart
`epg-verify-file' instead.</p>
<p>
For example:</p>
<p>
(let ((context (epg-make-context 'OpenPGP)))
  (decode-coding-string
    (epg-verify-string context (buffer-substring start end))
    'utf-8))</p>
<p>
(fn START END)</p>
