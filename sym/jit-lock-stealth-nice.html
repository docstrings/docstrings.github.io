<h3>Variable: jit-lock-stealth-nice</h3>
<p>
Time in seconds to pause between chunks of stealth fontification.<br>
Each iteration of stealth fontification is separated by this amount of time,<br>
thus reducing the demand that stealth fontification makes on the system.<br>
If nil, means stealth fontification is never paused.<br>
To reduce machine load during stealth fontification, at the cost of stealth<br>
taking longer to fontify, you could increase the value of this variable.<br>
See also `jit-lock-stealth-load'.</p>
