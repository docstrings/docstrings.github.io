<h3>Function: Info-scroll-down</h3>
<p>
Scroll one screenful back in Info, considering all nodes as one sequence.
If point is within the menu of a node, and `Info-scroll-prefer-subnodes'
is non-nil, this goes to its last subnode.  When you scroll past the
beginning of a node, that goes to the previous node or back up to the
parent node.</p>
