<h3>Function: describe-bindings-internal</h3>
<p>
Show a list of all defined keys, and their definitions.<br>
We put that list in a buffer, and display the buffer.<br>
<br>
The optional argument MENUS, if non-nil, says to mention menu bindings.<br>
(Ordinarily these are omitted from the output.)<br>
The optional argument PREFIX, if non-nil, should be a key sequence;<br>
then we display only bindings that start with that prefix.</p>
