<h3>Variable: byte-compile-dynamic</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, compile function bodies so they load lazily.<br>
They are hidden in comments in the compiled file,<br>
and each one is brought into core when the<br>
function is called.<br>
<br>
To enable this option, make it a file-local variable<br>
in the source file you want it to apply to.<br>
For example, add  -*-byte-compile-dynamic: t;-*- on the first line.<br>
<br>
When this option is true, if you load the compiled file and then move it,<br>
the functions you loaded will not be able to run.</p>
