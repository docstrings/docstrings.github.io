<h3>Variable: byte-compile-dynamic</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, compile function bodies so they load lazily.
They are hidden in comments in the compiled file,
and each one is brought into core when the
function is called.</p>
<p>
To enable this option, make it a file-local variable
in the source file you want it to apply to.
For example, add  -*-byte-compile-dynamic: t;-*- on the first line.</p>
<p>
When this option is true, if you load the compiled file and then move it,
the functions you loaded will not be able to run.</p>
