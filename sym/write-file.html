<h3>Function: write-file</h3>
<p>
Write current buffer into file FILENAME.
This makes the buffer visit that file, and marks it as not modified.</p>
<p>
If you specify just a directory name as FILENAME, that means to use
the default file name but in that directory.  You can also yank
the default file name into the minibuffer to edit it, using M-n.</p>
<p>
If the buffer is not already visiting a file, the default file name
for the output file is the buffer name.</p>
<p>
If optional second arg CONFIRM is non-nil, this function
asks for confirmation before overwriting an existing file.
Interactively, confirmation is required unless you supply a prefix argument.</p>
