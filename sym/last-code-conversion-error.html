<h3>Variable: last-code-conversion-error</h3>
<p>
Error status of the last code conversion.</p>
<p>
When an error was detected in the last code conversion, this variable
is set to one of the following symbols.
  `insufficient-source'
  `inconsistent-eol'
  `invalid-source'
  `interrupted'
  `insufficient-memory'
When no error was detected, the value doesn't change.  So, to check
the error status of a code conversion by this variable, you must
explicitly set this variable to nil before performing code
conversion.</p>
