<h3>Variable: last-code-conversion-error</h3>
<p>
Error status of the last code conversion.<br>
<br>
When an error was detected in the last code conversion, this variable<br>
is set to one of the following symbols.<br>
  `insufficient-source'<br>
  `inconsistent-eol'<br>
  `invalid-source'<br>
  `interrupted'<br>
  `insufficient-memory'<br>
When no error was detected, the value doesn't change.  So, to check<br>
the error status of a code conversion by this variable, you must<br>
explicitly set this variable to nil before performing code
conversion.</p>
