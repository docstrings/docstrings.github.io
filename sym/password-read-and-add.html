<h3>Function: password-read-and-add</h3>
<p>
Read password, for use with KEY, from user, or from cache if wanted.<br>
Then store the password in the cache.  Uses `password-read' and<br>
`password-cache-add'.  Custom variables `password-cache' and<br>
`password-cache-expiry' regulate cache behavior.<br>
<br>
Warning: the password is cached without checking that it is<br>
correct.  It is better to check the password before caching.  If<br>
you must use this function, take care to check passwords and<br>
remove incorrect ones from the cache.</p>
