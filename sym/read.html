<h3>Function: read</h3>
<p>
Read one Lisp expression as text from STREAM, return as Lisp object.
If STREAM is nil, use the value of `standard-input' (which see).
STREAM or the value of `standard-input' may be:
 a buffer (read from point and advance it)
 a marker (read from where it points and advance it)
 a function (call it with no arguments for each character,
     call it with a char as argument to push a char back)
 a string (takes text from string, starting at the beginning)
 t (read text line using minibuffer and use it, or read from
    standard input in batch mode).</p>
