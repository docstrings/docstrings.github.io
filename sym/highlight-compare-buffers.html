<h3>Function: highlight-compare-buffers</h3>
<p>
Compare two buffers and highlight the differences.</p>
<p>
The default is the current buffer and the one in the next window.</p>
<p>
If either buffer is modified and is visiting a file, you are prompted
to save the file.</p>
<p>
Unless the buffer is unmodified and visiting a file, the buffer is
written to a temporary file for comparison.</p>
<p>
If a buffer is read-only, differences will be highlighted but no property
changes are made, so M-x highlight-changes-next-change and
M-x highlight-changes-previous-change will not work.</p>
