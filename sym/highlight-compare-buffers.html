<h3>Function: highlight-compare-buffers</h3>
<p>
Compare two buffers and highlight the differences.<br>
<br>
The default is the current buffer and the one in the next window.<br>
<br>
If either buffer is modified and is visiting a file, you are prompted<br>
to save the file.<br>
<br>
Unless the buffer is unmodified and visiting a file, the buffer is<br>
written to a temporary file for comparison.<br>
<br>
If a buffer is read-only, differences will be highlighted but no property<br>
changes are made, so M-x highlight-changes-next-change and<br>
M-x highlight-changes-previous-change will not work.
