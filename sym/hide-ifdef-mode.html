<h3>Function: hide-ifdef-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle features to hide/show #ifdef blocks (Hide-Ifdef mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Hide-Ifdef mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Hide-Ifdef mode is a buffer-local minor mode for use with C and
C-like major modes.  When enabled, code within #ifdef constructs
that the C preprocessor would eliminate may be hidden from view.
Several variables affect how the hiding is done:</p>
<p>
`hide-ifdef-env'
	An association list of defined and undefined symbols for the
	current buffer.  Initially, the global value of `hide-ifdef-env'
	is used.</p>
<p>
`hide-ifdef-define-alist'
	An association list of defined symbol lists.
        Use `hide-ifdef-set-define-alist' to save the current `hide-ifdef-env'
        and `hide-ifdef-use-define-alist' to set the current `hide-ifdef-env'
        from one of the lists in `hide-ifdef-define-alist'.</p>
<p>
`hide-ifdef-lines'
	Set to non-nil to not show #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, and
	#endif lines when hiding.</p>
<p>
`hide-ifdef-initially'
	Indicates whether `hide-ifdefs' should be called when Hide-Ifdef mode
	is activated.</p>
<p>
`hide-ifdef-read-only'
	Set to non-nil if you want to make buffers read only while hiding.
	After `show-ifdefs', read-only status is restored to previous value.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `hide-ifdef-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
