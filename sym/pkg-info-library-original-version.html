<h3>Function: pkg-info-library-original-version</h3>
<p>
Get the original version in the header of LIBRARY.<br>
<br>
The original version is stored in the X-Original-Version header.<br>
This header is added by the MELPA package archive to preserve<br>
upstream version numbers.<br>
<br>
LIBRARY is either a symbol denoting a named feature, or a library<br>
name as string.<br>
<br>
If SHOW is non-nil, show the version in the minibuffer.<br>
<br>
Return the version from the header of LIBRARY as list.  Signal an<br>
error if the LIBRARY was not found or had no X-Original-Version<br>
header.<br>
<br>
See Info node `(elisp)Library Headers' for more information
about library headers.
