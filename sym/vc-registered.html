<h3>Function: vc-registered</h3>
<p>
Return non-nil if FILE is registered in a version control system.<br>
<br>
This function performs the check each time it is called.  To rely<br>
on the result of a previous call, use `vc-backend' instead.  If the<br>
file was previously registered under a certain backend, then that<br>
backend is tried first.</p>
