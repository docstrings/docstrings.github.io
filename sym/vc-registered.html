<h3>Function: vc-registered</h3>
<p>
Return non-nil if FILE is registered in a version control system.</p>
<p>
This function performs the check each time it is called.  To rely
on the result of a previous call, use `vc-backend' instead.  If the
file was previously registered under a certain backend, then that
backend is tried first.</p>
