<h3>Function: sql-db2</h3>
<p>
Run db2 by IBM as an inferior process.</p>
<p>
If buffer `*SQL*' exists but no process is running, make a new process.
If buffer exists and a process is running, just switch to buffer
`*SQL*'.</p>
<p>
Interpreter used comes from variable `sql-db2-program'.  There is not
automatic login.</p>
<p>
The buffer is put in SQL interactive mode, giving commands for sending
input.  See `sql-interactive-mode'.</p>
<p>
If you use M-x sql-accumulate-and-indent to send multiline commands to
db2, newlines will be escaped if necessary.  If you don't want that, set
`comint-input-sender' back to `comint-simple-send' by writing an after
advice.  See the elisp manual for more information.</p>
<p>
To set the buffer name directly, use C-u
before M-x sql-db2.  Once session has started,
M-x sql-rename-buffer can be called separately to rename the
buffer.</p>
<p>
To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the input and output to the process, use C-x RET c
before M-x sql-db2.  You can also specify this with C-x RET p
in the SQL buffer, after you start the process.
The default comes from `process-coding-system-alist' and
`default-process-coding-system'.</p>
<p>
(Type C-h m in the SQL buffer for a list of commands.)</p>
