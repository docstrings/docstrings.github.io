<h3>Function: x-disown-selection-internal</h3>
<p>
If we own the selection SELECTION, disown it.
Disowning it means there is no such selection.</p>
<p>
Sets the last-change time for the selection to TIME-OBJECT (by default
the time of the last event).</p>
<p>
TERMINAL should be a terminal object or a frame specifying the X
server to query.  If omitted or nil, that stands for the selected
frame's display, or the first available X display.</p>
<p>
On Nextstep, the TIME-OBJECT and TERMINAL arguments are unused.
On MS-DOS, all this does is return non-nil if we own the selection.</p>
<p>
(fn SELECTION &optional TIME-OBJECT TERMINAL)</p>
