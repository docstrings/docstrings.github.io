<h3>Function: bibtex-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for editing BibTeX files.<br>
<br>
General information on working with BibTeX mode:<br>
<br>
Use commands such as <br>
Uses keymap `bibtex-mode-map', which is not currently defined.<br>
M-x bibtex-Book to get a template for a specific entry.<br>
Then fill in all desired fields using M-x bibtex-next-field to jump from field<br>
to field.  After having filled in all desired fields in the entry, clean the<br>
new entry with the command M-x bibtex-clean-entry.<br>
<br>
Some features of BibTeX mode are available only by setting the variable<br>
`bibtex-maintain-sorted-entries' to non-nil.  However, then BibTeX mode<br>
works only with buffers containing valid (syntactically correct) and sorted<br>
entries.  This is usually the case, if you have created a buffer completely<br>
with BibTeX mode and finished every new entry with M-x bibtex-clean-entry.<br>
<br>
For third party BibTeX files, call the command M-x bibtex-convert-alien<br>
to fully take advantage of all features of BibTeX mode.<br>
<br>
<br>
Special information:<br>
<br>
A command such as M-x bibtex-Book outlines the fields for a BibTeX book entry.<br>
<br>
The names of optional fields start with the string OPT, and are thus ignored<br>
by BibTeX.  The names of alternative fields from which only one is required<br>
start with the string ALT.  The OPT or ALT string may be removed from<br>
the name of a field with M-x bibtex-remove-OPT-or-ALT.<br>
M-x bibtex-make-field inserts a new field after the current one.<br>
M-x bibtex-kill-field kills the current field entirely.<br>
M-x bibtex-yank yanks the last recently killed field after the current field.<br>
M-x bibtex-remove-delimiters removes the double-quotes or braces around the text of the current field.<br>
M-x bibtex-empty-field replaces the text of the current field with the default "" or {}.<br>
M-x bibtex-find-text moves point to the end of the current field.<br>
M-x completion-at-point completes word fragment before point according to context.<br>
<br>
The command M-x bibtex-clean-entry cleans the current entry, i.e. it removes OPT/ALT<br>
from the names of all non-empty optional or alternative fields, checks that<br>
no required fields are empty, and does some formatting dependent on the value<br>
of `bibtex-entry-format'.  Furthermore, it can automatically generate a key<br>
for the BibTeX entry, see `bibtex-generate-autokey'.<br>
Note: some functions in BibTeX mode depend on entries being in a special<br>
format (all fields beginning on separate lines), so it is usually a bad<br>
idea to remove `realign' from `bibtex-entry-format'.<br>
<br>
BibTeX mode supports Imenu and hideshow minor mode (`hs-minor-mode').<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------
Entry to BibTeX mode calls the value of `bibtex-mode-hook'
if that value is non-nil.


Uses keymap `bibtex-mode-map', which is not currently defined.
