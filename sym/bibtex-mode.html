<h3>Function: bibtex-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for editing BibTeX files.</p>
<p>
General information on working with BibTeX mode:</p>
<p>
Use commands such as 
Uses keymap `bibtex-mode-map', which is not currently defined.
M-x bibtex-Book to get a template for a specific entry.
Then fill in all desired fields using M-x bibtex-next-field to jump from field
to field.  After having filled in all desired fields in the entry, clean the
new entry with the command M-x bibtex-clean-entry.</p>
<p>
Some features of BibTeX mode are available only by setting the variable
`bibtex-maintain-sorted-entries' to non-nil.  However, then BibTeX mode
works only with buffers containing valid (syntactically correct) and sorted
entries.  This is usually the case, if you have created a buffer completely
with BibTeX mode and finished every new entry with M-x bibtex-clean-entry.</p>
<p>
For third party BibTeX files, call the command M-x bibtex-convert-alien
to fully take advantage of all features of BibTeX mode.</p>
<p>

Special information:</p>
<p>
A command such as M-x bibtex-Book outlines the fields for a BibTeX book entry.</p>
<p>
The names of optional fields start with the string OPT, and are thus ignored
by BibTeX.  The names of alternative fields from which only one is required
start with the string ALT.  The OPT or ALT string may be removed from
the name of a field with M-x bibtex-remove-OPT-or-ALT.
M-x bibtex-make-field inserts a new field after the current one.
M-x bibtex-kill-field kills the current field entirely.
M-x bibtex-yank yanks the last recently killed field after the current field.
M-x bibtex-remove-delimiters removes the double-quotes or braces around the text of the current field.
M-x bibtex-empty-field replaces the text of the current field with the default "" or {}.
M-x bibtex-find-text moves point to the end of the current field.
M-x completion-at-point completes word fragment before point according to context.</p>
<p>
The command M-x bibtex-clean-entry cleans the current entry, i.e. it removes OPT/ALT
from the names of all non-empty optional or alternative fields, checks that
no required fields are empty, and does some formatting dependent on the value
of `bibtex-entry-format'.  Furthermore, it can automatically generate a key
for the BibTeX entry, see `bibtex-generate-autokey'.
Note: some functions in BibTeX mode depend on entries being in a special
format (all fields beginning on separate lines), so it is usually a bad
idea to remove `realign' from `bibtex-entry-format'.</p>
<p>
BibTeX mode supports Imenu and hideshow minor mode (`hs-minor-mode').</p>
<p>
----------------------------------------------------------
Entry to BibTeX mode calls the value of `bibtex-mode-hook'
if that value is non-nil.</p>

Uses keymap `bibtex-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
