<h3>Function: indent-for-tab-command</h3>
<p>
Indent the current line or region, or insert a tab, as appropriate.
This function either inserts a tab, or indents the current line,
or performs symbol completion, depending on `tab-always-indent'.
The function called to actually indent the line or insert a tab
is given by the variable `indent-line-function'.</p>
<p>
If a prefix argument is given, after this function indents the
current line or inserts a tab, it also rigidly indents the entire
balanced expression which starts at the beginning of the current
line, to reflect the current line's indentation.</p>
<p>
In most major modes, if point was in the current line's
indentation, it is moved to the first non-whitespace character
after indenting; otherwise it stays at the same position relative
to the text.</p>
<p>
If `transient-mark-mode' is turned on and the region is active,
this function instead calls `indent-region'.  In this case, any
prefix argument is ignored.</p>
