<h3>Function: current-time-zone</h3>
<p>
Return the offset and name for the local time zone.
This returns a list of the form (OFFSET NAME).
OFFSET is an integer number of seconds ahead of UTC (east of Greenwich).
    A negative value means west of Greenwich.
NAME is a string giving the name of the time zone.
If SPECIFIED-TIME is given, the time zone offset is determined from it
instead of using the current time.  The argument should have the form
(HIGH LOW . IGNORED).  Thus, you can use times obtained from
`current-time' and from `file-attributes'.  SPECIFIED-TIME can also
have the form (HIGH . LOW), but this is considered obsolete.</p>
<p>
Some operating systems cannot provide all this information to Emacs;
in this case, `current-time-zone' returns a list containing nil for
the data it can't find.</p>
