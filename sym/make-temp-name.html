<h3>Function: make-temp-name</h3>
<p>
Generate temporary file name (string) starting with PREFIX (a string).
The Emacs process number forms part of the result,
so there is no danger of generating a name being used by another process.</p>
<p>
In addition, this function makes an attempt to choose a name
which has no existing file.  To make this work,
PREFIX should be an absolute file name.</p>
<p>
There is a race condition between calling `make-temp-name' and creating the
file which opens all kinds of security holes.  For that reason, you should
probably use `make-temp-file' instead, except in three circumstances:</p>
<p>
* If you are creating the file in the user's home directory.
* If you are creating a directory rather than an ordinary file.
* If you are taking special precautions as `make-temp-file' does.</p>
