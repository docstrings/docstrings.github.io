<h3>Variable: ignore-relative-composition</h3>
<p>
Char table of characters which are not composed relatively.
If an entry for a character is non-nil, a composition sequence
which contains that character is displayed so that
the glyph of that character is put without considering
an ascent and descent value of a previous character.</p>
