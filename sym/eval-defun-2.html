<h3>Function: eval-defun-2</h3>
<p>
Evaluate defun that point is in or before.
The value is displayed in the minibuffer.
If the current defun is actually a call to `defvar',
then reset the variable using the initial value expression
even if the variable already has some other value.
(Normally `defvar' does not change the variable's value
if it already has a value.)</p>
<p>
With argument, insert value in current buffer after the defun.
Return the result of evaluation.</p>
