<h3>Variable: tramp-file-name-regexp</h3>
<p>
Regular expression matching file names handled by Tramp.<br>
This regexp should match Tramp file names but no other file names.<br>
When tramp.el is loaded, this regular expression is prepended to<br>
`file-name-handler-alist', and that is searched sequentially.  Thus,<br>
if the Tramp entry appears rather early in the `file-name-handler-alist'<br>
and is a bit too general, then some files might be considered Tramp<br>
files which are not really Tramp files.<br>
<br>
Please note that the entry in `file-name-handler-alist' is made when<br>
this file (tramp.el) is loaded.  This means that this variable must be set<br>
before loading tramp.el.  Alternatively, `file-name-handler-alist' can be<br>
updated after changing this variable.

Also see `tramp-file-name-structure'.</p>
