<h3>Variable: file-coding-system-alist</h3>
<p>
Alist to decide a coding system to use for a file I/O operation.<br>
The format is ((PATTERN . VAL) ...),<br>
where PATTERN is a regular expression matching a file name,<br>
VAL is a coding system, a cons of coding systems, or a function symbol.<br>
If VAL is a coding system, it is used for both decoding and encoding<br>
the file contents.<br>
If VAL is a cons of coding systems, the car part is used for decoding,<br>
and the cdr part is used for encoding.<br>
If VAL is a function symbol, the function must return a coding system<br>
or a cons of coding systems which are used as above.  The function is<br>
called with an argument that is a list of the arguments with which<br>
`find-operation-coding-system' was called.  If the function can't decide<br>
a coding system, it can return `undecided' so that the normal<br>
code-detection is performed.<br>
<br>
See also the function `find-operation-coding-system'
and the variable `auto-coding-alist'.</p>
