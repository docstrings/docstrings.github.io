<h3>Function: compose-gstring-for-graphic</h3>
<p>
Compose glyph-string GSTRING for graphic display.
Combining characters are composed with the preceding base
character.  If the preceding character is not a base character,
each combining character is composed as a spacing character by
a padding space before and/or after the character.</p>

All non-spacing characters have this function in
`composition-function-table' unless overwritten.</p>
