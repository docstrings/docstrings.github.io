<h3>Function: buffer-chars-modified-tick</h3>
<p>
Return BUFFER's character-change tick counter.<br>
Each buffer has a character-change tick counter, which is set to the<br>
value of the buffer's tick counter (see `buffer-modified-tick'), each<br>
time text in that buffer is inserted or deleted.  By comparing the<br>
values returned by two individual calls of `buffer-chars-modified-tick',<br>
you can tell whether a character change occurred in that buffer in<br>
between these calls.  No argument or nil as argument means use current<br>
buffer as BUFFER.
