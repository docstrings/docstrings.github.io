<h3>Function: scheme-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for editing Scheme code.<br>
Editing commands are similar to those of `lisp-mode'.<br>
<br>
In addition, if an inferior Scheme process is running, some additional<br>
commands will be defined, for evaluating expressions and controlling<br>
the interpreter, and the state of the process will be displayed in the<br>
mode line of all Scheme buffers.  The names of commands that interact<br>
with the Scheme process start with "xscheme-" if you use the MIT<br>
Scheme-specific `xscheme' package; for more information see the<br>
documentation for `xscheme-interaction-mode'.  Use M-x run-scheme to<br>
start an inferior Scheme using the more general `cmuscheme' package.<br>
<br>
Commands:<br>
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.<br>
Blank lines separate paragraphs.  Semicolons start comments.<br>
<br>
Uses keymap `scheme-mode-map', which is not currently defined.<br>
<br>
Entry to this mode calls the value of `scheme-mode-hook'
if that value is non-nil.
