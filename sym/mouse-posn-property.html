<h3>Function: mouse-posn-property</h3>
<p>
Look for a property at click position.<br>
POS may be either a buffer position or a click position like<br>
those returned from `event-start'.  If the click position is on<br>
a string, the text property PROPERTY is examined.<br>
If this is nil or the click is not on a string, then<br>
the corresponding buffer position is searched for PROPERTY.<br>
If PROPERTY is encountered in one of those places,<br>
its value is returned.
