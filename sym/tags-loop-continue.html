<h3>Function: tags-loop-continue</h3>
<p>
Continue last M-x tags-search or M-x tags-query-replace command.<br>
Used noninteractively with non-nil argument to begin such a command (the<br>
argument is passed to `next-file', which see).<br>
<br>
Two variables control the processing we do on each file: the value of<br>
`tags-loop-scan' is a form to be executed on each file to see if it is<br>
interesting (it returns non-nil if so) and `tags-loop-operate' is a form to<br>
evaluate to operate on an interesting file.  If the latter evaluates to<br>
nil, we exit; otherwise we scan the next file.
