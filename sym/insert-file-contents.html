<h3>Function: insert-file-contents</h3>
<p>
Insert contents of file FILENAME after point.
Returns list of absolute file name and number of characters inserted.
If second argument VISIT is non-nil, the buffer's visited filename and
last save file modtime are set, and it is marked unmodified.  If
visiting and the file does not exist, visiting is completed before the
error is signaled.</p>
<p>
The optional third and fourth arguments BEG and END specify what portion
of the file to insert.  These arguments count bytes in the file, not
characters in the buffer.  If VISIT is non-nil, BEG and END must be nil.</p>
<p>
If optional fifth argument REPLACE is non-nil, replace the current
buffer contents (in the accessible portion) with the file contents.
This is better than simply deleting and inserting the whole thing
because (1) it preserves some marker positions and (2) it puts less data
in the undo list.  When REPLACE is non-nil, the second return value is
the number of characters that replace previous buffer contents.</p>

This function does code conversion according to the value of
`coding-system-for-read' or `file-coding-system-alist', and sets the
variable `last-coding-system-used' to the coding system actually used.</p>
<p>
In addition, this function decodes the inserted text from known formats
by calling `format-decode', which see.</p>
