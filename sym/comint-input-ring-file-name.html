<h3>Variable: comint-input-ring-file-name</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, name of the file to read/write input history.
See also `comint-read-input-ring' and `comint-write-input-ring'.
`comint-mode' makes this a buffer-local variable.  You probably want
to set this in a mode hook, rather than customize the default value.</p>
