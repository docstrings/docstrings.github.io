<h3>Function: latin1-display</h3>
<p>
Set up Latin-1/ASCII display for the arguments character SETS.
See option `latin1-display' for the method.  The members of the list
must be in `latin1-display-sets'.  With no arguments, reset the
display for all of `latin1-display-sets'. See also
`latin1-display-setup'.</p>
<p>
(fn &rest SETS)</p>
<h3>Variable: latin1-display</h3>
<p>
Set up Latin-1/ASCII display for ISO8859 character sets.
This is done for each character set in the list `latin1-display-sets',
if no font is available to display it.  Characters are displayed using
the corresponding Latin-1 characters where they match.  Otherwise
ASCII sequences are used, mostly following the Latin prefix input
methods.  Some different ASCII sequences are used if
`latin1-display-mnemonic' is non-nil.</p>
<p>
This option also treats some characters in the `mule-unicode-...'
charsets if you don't have a Unicode font with which to display them.</p>
<p>
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either M-x customize or the function `latin1-display'.</p>
