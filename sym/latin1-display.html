<h3>Variable: latin1-display</h3>
<p>
Set up Latin-1/ASCII display for ISO8859 character sets.<br>
This is done for each character set in the list `latin1-display-sets',<br>
if no font is available to display it.  Characters are displayed using<br>
the corresponding Latin-1 characters where they match.  Otherwise<br>
ASCII sequences are used, mostly following the Latin prefix input<br>
methods.  Some different ASCII sequences are used if<br>
`latin1-display-mnemonic' is non-nil.<br>
<br>
This option also treats some characters in the `mule-unicode-...'<br>
charsets if you don't have a Unicode font with which to display them.<br>
<br>
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;<br>
use either M-x customize or the function `latin1-display'.</p>
