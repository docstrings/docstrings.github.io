<h3>Variable: imagemagick-render-type</h3>
<p>
Integer indicating which ImageMagick rendering method to use.<br>
The options are:<br>
  0 -- the default method (pixel pushing)<br>
  1 -- a newer method ("MagickExportImagePixels") that may perform<br>
       better (speed etc) in some cases, but has not been as thoroughly<br>
       tested with Emacs as the default method.  This method requires<br>
       ImageMagick version 6.4.6 (approximately) or later.</p>
