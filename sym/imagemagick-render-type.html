<h3>Variable: imagemagick-render-type</h3>
<p>
Integer indicating which ImageMagick rendering method to use.
The options are:
  0 -- the default method (pixel pushing)
  1 -- a newer method ("MagickExportImagePixels") that may perform
       better (speed etc) in some cases, but has not been as thoroughly
       tested with Emacs as the default method.  This method requires
       ImageMagick version 6.4.6 (approximately) or later.</p>
