<h3>Function: next-error-buffer-p</h3>
<p>
Test if BUFFER is a `next-error' capable buffer.<br>
<br>
If AVOID-CURRENT is non-nil, treat the current buffer<br>
as an absolute last resort only.<br>
<br>
The function EXTRA-TEST-INCLUSIVE, if non-nil, is called in each buffer<br>
that normally would not qualify.  If it returns t, the buffer<br>
in question is treated as usable.<br>
<br>
The function EXTRA-TEST-EXCLUSIVE, if non-nil, is called in each buffer<br>
that would normally be considered usable.  If it returns nil,
that buffer is rejected.</p>
