<h3>Function: ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit</h3>
<p>
Like `ert-run-tests-batch', but exits Emacs when done.<br>
<br>
The exit status will be 0 if all test results were as expected, 1<br>
on unexpected results, or 2 if the tool detected an error outside<br>
of the tests (e.g. invalid SELECTOR or bug in the code that runs<br>
the tests).<br>

(fn &optional SELECTOR)</p>
