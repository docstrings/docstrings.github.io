<h3>Variable: imagemagick-enabled-types</h3>
<p>
List of ImageMagick types to treat as images.<br>
Each list element should be a string or symbol, representing one<br>
of the image types returned by `imagemagick-types'.  If the<br>
element is a string, it is handled as a regexp that enables all<br>
matching types.<br>
<br>
The value of `imagemagick-enabled-types' may also be t, meaning<br>
to enable all types that ImageMagick supports.<br>
<br>
The variable `imagemagick-types-inhibit' overrides this variable.<br>
<br>
If you change this without using customize, you must call<br>
`imagemagick-register-types' afterwards.<br>
<br>
If Emacs is compiled without ImageMagick support, this variable
has no effect.</p>
