<h3>Variable: imagemagick-enabled-types</h3>
<p>
List of ImageMagick types to treat as images.
Each list element should be a string or symbol, representing one
of the image types returned by `imagemagick-types'.  If the
element is a string, it is handled as a regexp that enables all
matching types.</p>
<p>
The value of `imagemagick-enabled-types' may also be t, meaning
to enable all types that ImageMagick supports.</p>
<p>
The variable `imagemagick-types-inhibit' overrides this variable.</p>
<p>
If you change this without using customize, you must call
`imagemagick-register-types' afterwards.</p>
<p>
If Emacs is compiled without ImageMagick support, this variable
has no effect.</p>
