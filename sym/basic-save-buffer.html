<h3>Function: basic-save-buffer</h3>
<p>
Save the current buffer in its visited file, if it has been modified.
The hooks `write-contents-functions' and `write-file-functions' get a chance
to do the job of saving; if they do not, then the buffer is saved in
the visited file in the usual way.
Before and after saving the buffer, this function runs
`before-save-hook' and `after-save-hook', respectively.</p>
