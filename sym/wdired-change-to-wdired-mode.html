<h3>Function: wdired-change-to-wdired-mode</h3>
<p>
Put a Dired buffer in Writable Dired (WDired) mode.<br>
<br>
Uses keymap `wdired-mode-map', which is not currently defined.<br>
<br>
In WDired mode, you can edit the names of the files in the<br>
buffer, the target of the links, and the permission bits of the<br>
files.  After typing M-x wdired-finish-edit, Emacs modifies the files and<br>
directories to reflect your edits.

See `wdired-mode'.
