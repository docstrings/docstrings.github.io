<h3>Variable: widen-automatically</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means it is ok for commands to call `widen' when they want to.
Some commands will do this in order to go to positions outside
the current accessible part of the buffer.</p>
<p>
If `widen-automatically' is nil, these commands will do something else
as a fallback, and won't change the buffer bounds.</p>
