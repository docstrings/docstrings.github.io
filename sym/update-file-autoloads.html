<h3>Function: update-file-autoloads</h3>
<p>
Update the autoloads for FILE.<br>
If prefix arg SAVE-AFTER is non-nil, save the buffer too.<br>
<br>
If FILE binds `generated-autoload-file' as a file-local variable,<br>
autoloads are written into that file.  Otherwise, the autoloads<br>
file is determined by OUTFILE.  If called interactively, prompt<br>
for OUTFILE; if called from Lisp with OUTFILE nil, use the<br>
existing value of `generated-autoload-file'.<br>
<br>
Return FILE if there was no autoload cookie in it, else nil.<br>

(fn FILE &optional SAVE-AFTER OUTFILE)</p>
