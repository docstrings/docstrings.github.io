<h3>Function: update-file-autoloads</h3>
<p>
Update the autoloads for FILE.
If prefix arg SAVE-AFTER is non-nil, save the buffer too.</p>
<p>
If FILE binds `generated-autoload-file' as a file-local variable,
autoloads are written into that file.  Otherwise, the autoloads
file is determined by OUTFILE.  If called interactively, prompt
for OUTFILE; if called from Lisp with OUTFILE nil, use the
existing value of `generated-autoload-file'.</p>
<p>
Return FILE if there was no autoload cookie in it, else nil.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE &optional SAVE-AFTER OUTFILE)</p>
