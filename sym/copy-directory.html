<h3>Function: copy-directory</h3>
<p>
Copy DIRECTORY to NEWNAME.  Both args must be strings.
This function always sets the file modes of the output files to match
the corresponding input file.</p>
<p>
The third arg KEEP-TIME non-nil means give the output files the same
last-modified time as the old ones.  (This works on only some systems.)</p>
<p>
A prefix arg makes KEEP-TIME non-nil.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, the last argument PARENTS says whether to
create parent directories if they don't exist.  Interactively,
this happens by default.</p>
<p>
If NEWNAME names an existing directory, copy DIRECTORY as a
subdirectory there.  However, if called from Lisp with a non-nil
optional argument COPY-CONTENTS, copy the contents of DIRECTORY
directly into NEWNAME instead.</p>
