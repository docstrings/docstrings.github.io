<h3>Variable: bytecomp-version-regexp</h3>
<p>
Regular expression matching safe to load compiled Lisp files.<br>
When Emacs loads a compiled Lisp file, it reads the first 512 bytes<br>
from the file, and matches them against this regular expression.<br>
When the regular expression matches, the file is considered to be safe<br>
to load.  See also `load-dangerous-libraries'.</p>
