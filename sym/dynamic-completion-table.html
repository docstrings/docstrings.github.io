<h3>Function: dynamic-completion-table</h3>
<p>
Use function FUN as a dynamic completion table.
FUN is called with one argument, the string for which completion is required,
and it should return an alist containing all the intended possible completions.
This alist may be a full list of possible completions so that FUN can ignore
the value of its argument.  If completion is performed in the minibuffer,
FUN will be called in the buffer from which the minibuffer was entered.</p>
<p>
The result of the `completion-table-dynamic' form is a function
that can be used as the COLLECTION argument to `try-completion' and
`all-completions'.  See Info node `(elisp)Programmed Completion'.</p>
