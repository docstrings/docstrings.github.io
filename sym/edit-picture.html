<h3>Function: edit-picture</h3>
<p>
Switch to Picture mode, in which a quarter-plane screen model is used.</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `picture-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
Printing characters replace instead of inserting themselves with motion
afterwards settable by these commands:</p>
<p>
 Move left after insertion:            M-x picture-movement-left
 Move right after insertion:           M-x picture-movement-right
 Move up after insertion:              M-x picture-movement-up
 Move down after insertion:            M-x picture-movement-down</p>
<p>
 Move northwest (nw) after insertion:  M-x picture-movement-nw
 Move northeast (ne) after insertion:  M-x picture-movement-ne
 Move southwest (sw) after insertion:  M-x picture-movement-sw
 Move southeast (se) after insertion:  M-x picture-movement-se</p>
<p>
 Move westnorthwest (wnw) after insertion:  C-u M-x picture-movement-nw
 Move eastnortheast (ene) after insertion:  C-u M-x picture-movement-ne
 Move westsouthwest (wsw) after insertion:  C-u M-x picture-movement-sw
 Move eastsoutheast (ese) after insertion:  C-u M-x picture-movement-se</p>
<p>
The current direction is displayed in the mode line.  The initial
direction is right.  Whitespace is inserted and tabs are changed to
spaces when required by movement.  You can move around in the buffer
with these commands:</p>
<p>
 Move vertically to SAME column in previous line: M-x picture-move-down
 Move vertically to SAME column in next line:     M-x picture-move-up
 Move to column following last
  non-whitespace character:                       M-x picture-end-of-line
 Move right, inserting spaces if required:        M-x picture-forward-column
 Move left changing tabs to spaces if required:   M-x picture-backward-column
 Move in direction of current picture motion:     M-x picture-motion
 Move opposite to current picture motion:         M-x picture-motion-reverse
 Move to beginning of next line:                  C-n</p>
<p>
You can edit tabular text with these commands:</p>
<p>
 Move to column beneath (or at) next interesting
  character (see variable `picture-tab-chars'):   M-x picture-tab-search
 Move to next stop in tab stop list:              M-x picture-tab
 Set tab stops according to context of this line: M-x picture-set-tab-stops
   (With ARG, resets tab stops to default value.)
 Change the tab stop list:                        M-x edit-tab-stops</p>
<p>
You can manipulate text with these commands:
 Clear ARG columns after point without moving:    M-x picture-clear-column
 Delete char at point:                            M-x picture-delete-char
 Clear ARG columns backward:                      M-x picture-backward-clear-column
 Clear ARG lines, advancing over them:            M-x picture-clear-line
  (the cleared text is saved in the kill ring)
 Open blank line(s) beneath current line:         M-x picture-open-line</p>
<p>
You can manipulate rectangles with these commands:
  Clear a rectangle and save it:                  M-x picture-clear-rectangle
  Clear a rectangle, saving in a named register:  M-x picture-clear-rectangle-to-register
  Insert currently saved rectangle at point:      M-x picture-yank-rectangle
  Insert rectangle from named register:           M-x picture-yank-rectangle-from-register
  Draw a rectangular box around mark and point:   M-x picture-draw-rectangle
  Copies a rectangle to a register:               C-x r r
  Undo effects of rectangle overlay commands:     C-x u</p>
<p>
You can return to the previous mode with M-x picture-mode-exit, which
also strips trailing whitespace from every line.  Stripping is suppressed
by supplying an argument.</p>
<p>
Entry to this mode calls the value of `picture-mode-hook' if non-nil.</p>
<p>
Note that Picture mode commands will work outside of Picture mode, but
they are not by default assigned to keys.</p>
