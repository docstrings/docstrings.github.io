Switch to Picture mode, in which a quarter-plane screen model is used.<br>
<br>
Uses keymap `picture-mode-map', which is not currently defined.<br>
<br>

afterwards settable by these commands:<br>
<br>
 Move left after insertion:            M-x picture-movement-left<br>
 Move right after insertion:           M-x picture-movement-right<br>
 Move up after insertion:              M-x picture-movement-up<br>
 Move down after insertion:            M-x picture-movement-down<br>
<br>
 Move northwest (nw) after insertion:  M-x picture-movement-nw<br>
 Move northeast (ne) after insertion:  M-x picture-movement-ne<br>
 Move southwest (sw) after insertion:  M-x picture-movement-sw<br>
 Move southeast (se) after insertion:  M-x picture-movement-se<br>
<br>
 Move westnorthwest (wnw) after insertion:  C-u M-x picture-movement-nw<br>
 Move eastnortheast (ene) after insertion:  C-u M-x picture-movement-ne<br>

The current direction is displayed in the mode line.  The initial<br>
direction is right.  Whitespace is inserted and tabs are changed to<br>
spaces when required by movement.  You can move around in the buffer<br>
with these commands:<br>
<br>
 Move vertically to SAME column in previous line: M-x picture-move-down<br>
 Move vertically to SAME column in next line:     M-x picture-move-up<br>
 Move to column following last<br>
  non-whitespace character:                       M-x picture-end-of-line<br>
 Move right, inserting spaces if required:        M-x picture-forward-column<br>
 Move left changing tabs to spaces if required:   M-x picture-backward-column<br>
 Move in direction of current picture motion:     M-x picture-motion<br>
 Move opposite to current picture motion:         M-x picture-motion-reverse<br>
 Move to beginning of next line:                  C-n<br>
<br>
You can edit tabular text with these commands:<br>
<br>
 Move to column beneath (or at) next interesting<br>
  character (see variable `picture-tab-chars'):   M-x picture-tab-search<br>
 Move to next stop in tab stop list:              M-x picture-tab<br>
 Set tab stops according to context of this line: M-x picture-set-tab-stops<br>
   (With ARG, resets tab stops to default value.)<br>
 Change the tab stop list:                        M-x edit-tab-stops<br>
<br>
You can manipulate text with these commands:<br>
 Clear ARG columns after point without moving:    M-x picture-clear-column<br>
 Delete char at point:                            M-x picture-delete-char<br>
 Clear ARG columns backward:                      M-x picture-backward-clear-column<br>
 Clear ARG lines, advancing over them:            M-x picture-clear-line<br>
  (the cleared text is saved in the kill ring)<br>
 Open blank line(s) beneath current line:         M-x picture-open-line<br>
<br>
You can manipulate rectangles with these commands:<br>
  Clear a rectangle and save it:                  M-x picture-clear-rectangle<br>
  Clear a rectangle, saving in a named register:  M-x picture-clear-rectangle-to-register<br>
  Insert currently saved rectangle at point:      M-x picture-yank-rectangle<br>
  Insert rectangle from named register:           M-x picture-yank-rectangle-from-register<br>
  Draw a rectangular box around mark and point:   M-x picture-draw-rectangle<br>
  Copies a rectangle to a register:               C-x r r<br>
  Undo effects of rectangle overlay commands:     C-x u<br>
<br>
You can return to the previous mode with M-x picture-mode-exit, which<br>
also strips trailing whitespace from every line.  Stripping is suppressed
by supplying an argument.

Entry to this mode calls the value of `picture-mode-hook' if non-nil.

Note that Picture mode commands will work outside of Picture mode, but
they are not by default assigned to keys.
