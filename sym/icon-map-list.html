<h3>Variable: icon-map-list</h3>
<p>
A list of alists that map icon file names to stock/named icons.<br>
The alists are searched in the order they appear.  The first match is used.<br>
The keys in the alists are file names without extension and with two directory<br>
components.  For example, to map /usr/share/emacs/22.1.1/etc/images/open.xpm<br>
to stock item gtk-open, use:<br>
<br>
  ("etc/images/open" . "gtk-open")<br>
<br>
Themes also have named icons.  To map to one of those, use n: before the name:<br>
<br>
  ("etc/images/diropen" . "n:system-file-manager")<br>
<br>
The list elements are either the symbol name for the alist or the<br>
alist itself.<br>

If you don't want stock icons, set the variable to nil.</p>
