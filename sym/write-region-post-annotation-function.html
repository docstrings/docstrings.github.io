<h3>Variable: write-region-post-annotation-function</h3>
<p>
Function to call after `write-region' completes.
The function is called with no arguments.  If one or more of the
annotation functions in `write-region-annotate-functions' changed the
current buffer, the function stored in this variable is called for
each of those additional buffers as well, in addition to the original
buffer.  The relevant buffer is current during each function call.</p>
