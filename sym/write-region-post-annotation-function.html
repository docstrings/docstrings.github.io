<h3>Variable: write-region-post-annotation-function</h3>
<p>
Function to call after `write-region' completes.<br>
The function is called with no arguments.  If one or more of the<br>
annotation functions in `write-region-annotate-functions' changed the<br>
current buffer, the function stored in this variable is called for<br>
each of those additional buffers as well, in addition to the original<br>
buffer.  The relevant buffer is current during each function call.</p>
