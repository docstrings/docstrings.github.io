<h3>Variable: buffer-stale-function</h3>
<p>
Function to check whether a non-file buffer needs reverting.
This should be a function with one optional argument NOCONFIRM.
Auto Revert Mode passes t for NOCONFIRM.  The function should return
non-nil if the buffer should be reverted.  A return value of
`fast' means that the need for reverting was not checked, but
that reverting the buffer is fast.  The buffer is current when
this function is called.</p>
<p>
The idea behind the NOCONFIRM argument is that it should be
non-nil if the buffer is going to be reverted without asking the
user.  In such situations, one has to be careful with potentially
time consuming operations.</p>
<p>
For more information on how this variable is used by Auto Revert mode,
see Info node `(emacs)Supporting additional buffers'.</p>
