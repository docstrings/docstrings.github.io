<h3>Function: memory-use-counts</h3>
<p>
Return a list of counters that measure how much consing there has been.
Each of these counters increments for a certain kind of object.
The counters wrap around from the largest positive integer to zero.
Garbage collection does not decrease them.
The elements of the value are as follows:
  (CONSES FLOATS VECTOR-CELLS SYMBOLS STRING-CHARS MISCS INTERVALS STRINGS)
All are in units of 1 = one object consed
except for VECTOR-CELLS and STRING-CHARS, which count the total length of
objects consed.
MISCS include overlays, markers, and some internal types.
Frames, windows, buffers, and subprocesses count as vectors
  (but the contents of a buffer's text do not count here).</p>
