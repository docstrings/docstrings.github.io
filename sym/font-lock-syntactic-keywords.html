<h3>Variable: font-lock-syntactic-keywords</h3>
<p>
A list of the syntactic keywords to put syntax properties on.
The value can be the list itself, or the name of a function or variable
whose value is the list.</p>
<p>
See `font-lock-keywords' for a description of the form of this list;
only the differences are stated here.  MATCH-HIGHLIGHT should be of the form:</p>
<p>
 (SUBEXP SYNTAX OVERRIDE LAXMATCH)</p>
<p>
where SYNTAX can be a string (as taken by `modify-syntax-entry'), a syntax
table, a cons cell (as returned by `string-to-syntax') or an expression whose
value is such a form.  OVERRIDE cannot be `prepend' or `append'.</p>
<p>
Here are two examples of elements of `font-lock-syntactic-keywords'
and what they do:</p>
<p>
 ("\\$\\(#\\)" 1 ".")</p>
<p>
 gives a hash character punctuation syntax (".") when following a
 dollar-sign character.  Hash characters in other contexts will still
 follow whatever the syntax table says about the hash character.</p>
<p>
 ("\\('\\).\\('\\)"
  (1 "\"")
  (2 "\""))</p>
<p>
 gives a pair single-quotes, which surround a single character, a SYNTAX of
 "\"" (meaning string quote syntax).  Single-quote characters in other
 contexts will not be affected.</p>
<p>
This is normally set via `font-lock-defaults'.</p>
