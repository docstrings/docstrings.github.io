<h3>Variable: font-lock-maximum-decoration</h3>
<p>
Maximum decoration level for fontification.
If nil, use the default decoration (typically the minimum available).
If t, use the maximum decoration available.
If a number, use that level of decoration (or if not available the maximum).
The higher the number, the more decoration is done.
If a list, each element should be a cons pair of the form (MAJOR-MODE . LEVEL),
where MAJOR-MODE is a symbol or t (meaning the default).  For example:
 ((c-mode . t) (c++-mode . 2) (t . 1))
means use the maximum decoration available for buffers in C mode, level 2
decoration for buffers in C++ mode, and level 1 decoration otherwise.</p>
