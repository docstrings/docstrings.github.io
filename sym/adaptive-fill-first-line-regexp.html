<h3>Variable: adaptive-fill-first-line-regexp</h3>
<p>
Regexp specifying whether to set fill prefix from a one-line paragraph.
When a paragraph has just one line, then after `adaptive-fill-regexp'
finds the prefix at the beginning of the line, if it doesn't
match this regexp, it is replaced with whitespace.</p>
<p>
By default, this regexp matches sequences of just spaces and tabs.</p>
<p>
However, we never use a prefix from a one-line paragraph
if it would act as a paragraph-starter on the second line.</p>
