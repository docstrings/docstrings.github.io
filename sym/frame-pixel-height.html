<h3>Function: frame-pixel-height</h3>
<p>
Return a FRAME's height in pixels.
If FRAME is omitted, the selected frame is used.  The exact value
of the result depends on the window-system and toolkit in use:</p>
<p>
In the Gtk+ version of Emacs, it includes only any window (including
the minibuffer or echo area), mode line, and header line.  It does not
include the tool bar or menu bar.</p>
<p>
With other graphical versions, it also includes the tool bar and the
menu bar.</p>
<p>
For a text terminal, it includes the menu bar.  In this case, the
result is really in characters rather than pixels (i.e., is identical
to `frame-height').</p>
