<h3>Function: frame-pixel-height</h3>
<p>
Return a FRAME's height in pixels.<br>
If FRAME is omitted, the selected frame is used.  The exact value<br>
of the result depends on the window-system and toolkit in use:<br>
<br>
In the Gtk+ version of Emacs, it includes only any window (including<br>
the minibuffer or echo area), mode line, and header line.  It does not<br>
include the tool bar or menu bar.<br>
<br>
With other graphical versions, it also includes the tool bar and the<br>
menu bar.<br>
<br>
For a text terminal, it includes the menu bar.  In this case, the<br>
result is really in characters rather than pixels (i.e., is identical
to `frame-height').
