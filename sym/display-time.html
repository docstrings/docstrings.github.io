<h3>Function: display-time</h3>
<p>
Enable display of time, load level, and mail flag in mode lines.
This display updates automatically every minute.
If `display-time-day-and-date' is non-nil, the current day and date
are displayed as well.
This runs the normal hook `display-time-hook' after each update.</p>
