<h3>Function: composition-get-gstring</h3>
<p>
Return a glyph-string for characters between FROM and TO.
If the glyph string is for graphic display, FONT-OBJECT must be
a font-object to use for those characters.
Otherwise (for terminal display), FONT-OBJECT must be a terminal ID, a
frame, or nil for the selected frame's terminal device.</p>
<p>
If the optional 4th argument STRING is not nil, it is a string
containing the target characters between indices FROM and TO.</p>
<p>
A glyph-string is a vector containing information about how to display
a specific character sequence.  The format is:
   [HEADER ID GLYPH ...]</p>
<p>
HEADER is a vector of this form:
    [FONT-OBJECT CHAR ...]
where
    FONT-OBJECT is a font-object for all glyphs in the glyph-string,
    or the terminal coding system of the specified terminal.
    CHARs are characters to be composed by GLYPHs.</p>
<p>
ID is an identification number of the glyph-string.  It may be nil if
not yet shaped.</p>
<p>
GLYPH is a vector whose elements have this form:
    [ FROM-IDX TO-IDX C CODE WIDTH LBEARING RBEARING ASCENT DESCENT
      [ [X-OFF Y-OFF WADJUST] | nil] ]
where
    FROM-IDX and TO-IDX are used internally and should not be touched.
    C is the character of the glyph.
    CODE is the glyph-code of C in FONT-OBJECT.
    WIDTH thru DESCENT are the metrics (in pixels) of the glyph.
    X-OFF and Y-OFF are offsets to the base position for the glyph.
    WADJUST is the adjustment to the normal width of the glyph.</p>
<p>
If GLYPH is nil, the remaining elements of the glyph-string vector
should be ignored.</p>
