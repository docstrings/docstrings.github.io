<h3>Variable: mouse-1-click-follows-link</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means that clicking Mouse-1 on a link follows the link.</p>
<p>
With the default setting, an ordinary Mouse-1 click on a link
performs the same action as Mouse-2 on that link, while a longer
Mouse-1 click (hold down the Mouse-1 button for more than 450
milliseconds) performs the original Mouse-1 binding (which
typically sets point where you click the mouse).</p>
<p>
If value is an integer, the time elapsed between pressing and
releasing the mouse button determines whether to follow the link
or perform the normal Mouse-1 action (typically set point).
The absolute numeric value specifies the maximum duration of a
"short click" in milliseconds.  A positive value means that a
short click follows the link, and a longer click performs the
normal action.  A negative value gives the opposite behavior.</p>
<p>
If value is `double', a double click follows the link.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, a single Mouse-1 click unconditionally follows the link.</p>
<p>
Note that dragging the mouse never follows the link.</p>
<p>
This feature only works in modes that specifically identify
clickable text as links, so it may not work with some external
packages.  See `mouse-on-link-p' for details.</p>
