<h3>Variable: completion-cycle-threshold</h3>
<p>
Number of completion candidates below which cycling is used.
Depending on this setting `minibuffer-complete' may use cycling,
like `minibuffer-force-complete'.
If nil, cycling is never used.
If t, cycling is always used.
If an integer, cycling is used so long as there are not more
completion candidates than this number.</p>
