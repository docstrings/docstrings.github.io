<h3>Function: frame-or-buffer-changed-p</h3>
<p>
Return non-nil if the frame and buffer state appears to have changed.<br>
VARIABLE is a variable name whose value is either nil or a state vector<br>
that will be updated to contain all frames and buffers,<br>
aside from buffers whose names start with space,<br>
along with the buffers' read-only and modified flags.  This allows a fast<br>
check to see whether buffer menus might need to be recomputed.<br>
If this function returns non-nil, it updates the internal vector to reflect<br>
the current state.<br>
<br>
If VARIABLE is nil, an internal variable is used.  Users should not<br>
pass nil for VARIABLE.
