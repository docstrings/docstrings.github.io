<h3>Function: file-accessible-directory-p</h3>
<p>
Return t if file FILENAME names a directory you can open.<br>
For the value to be t, FILENAME must specify the name of a directory as a file,<br>
and the directory must allow you to open files in it.  In order to use a<br>
directory as a buffer's current directory, this predicate must return true.<br>
A directory name spec may be given instead; then the value is t<br>
if the directory so specified exists and really is a readable and<br>
searchable directory.
