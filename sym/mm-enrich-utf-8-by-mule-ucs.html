<h3>Function: mm-enrich-utf-8-by-mule-ucs</h3>
<p>
Make the `utf-8' MIME charset usable by the Mule-UCS package.
This function will run when the `un-define' module is loaded under
XEmacs, and fill the `utf-8' entry in `mm-mime-mule-charset-alist'
with Mule charsets.  It is completely useless for Emacs.</p>
