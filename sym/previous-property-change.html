<h3>Function: previous-property-change</h3>
<p>
Return the position of previous property change.
Scans characters backwards from POSITION in OBJECT till it finds
a change in some text property, then returns the position of the change.
If the optional second argument OBJECT is a buffer (or nil, which means
the current buffer), POSITION is a buffer position (integer or marker).
If OBJECT is a string, POSITION is a 0-based index into it.
Return nil if the property is constant all the way to the start of OBJECT.
If the value is non-nil, it is a position less than POSITION, never equal.</p>
<p>
If the optional third argument LIMIT is non-nil, don't search
back past position LIMIT; return LIMIT if nothing is found until LIMIT.</p>
<p>
