What is Solitaire?</p>
<p>
I don't know who invented this game, but it seems to be rather old and
its origin seems to be northern Africa.  Here's how to play:
Initially, the board will look similar to this:</p>
<p>
	Le Solitaire
	============</p>
<p>
		o   o   o</p>
<p>
		o   o   o</p>
<p>
	o   o   o   o   o   o   o</p>
<p>
	o   o   o   .   o   o   o</p>
<p>
	o   o   o   o   o   o   o</p>
<p>
		o   o   o</p>
<p>
		o   o   o</p>
<p>
Let's call the o's stones and the .'s holes.  One stone fits into one
hole.  As you can see, all holes but one are occupied by stones.  The
aim of the game is to get rid of all but one stone, leaving that last
one in the middle of the board if you're cool.</p>
<p>
A stone can be moved if there is another stone next to it, and a hole
after that one.  Thus there must be three fields in a row, either
horizontally or vertically, up, down, left or right, which look like
this:  o  o  .</p>
<p>
Then the first stone is moved to the hole, jumping over the second,
which therefore is taken away.  The above thus `evaluates' to:  .  .  o</p>
<p>
That's all.  Here's the board after two moves:</p>
<p>
		o   o   o</p>
<p>
		.   o   o</p>
<p>
	o   o   .   o   o   o   o</p>
<p>
	o   .   o   o   o   o   o</p>
<p>
	o   o   o   o   o   o   o</p>
<p>
		o   o   o</p>
<p>
		o   o   o</p>
