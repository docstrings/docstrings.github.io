What is Solitaire?<br>
<br>
I don't know who invented this game, but it seems to be rather old and<br>
its origin seems to be northern Africa.  Here's how to play:<br>
Initially, the board will look similar to this:<br>

Let's call the o's stones and the .'s holes.  One stone fits into one<br>
hole.  As you can see, all holes but one are occupied by stones.  The<br>
aim of the game is to get rid of all but one stone, leaving that last<br>
one in the middle of the board if you're cool.<br>
<br>
A stone can be moved if there is another stone next to it, and a hole<br>
after that one.  Thus there must be three fields in a row, either<br>
horizontally or vertically, up, down, left or right, which look like<br>
this:  o  o  .<br>
<br>
Then the first stone is moved to the hole, jumping over the second,<br>
which therefore is taken away.  The above thus `evaluates' to:  .  .  o<br>
<br>
That's all.  Here's the board after two moves:<br>
<br>
		o   o   o<br>
<br>
		.   o   o<br>
<br>
	o   o   .   o   o   o   o

	o   .   o   o   o   o   o
