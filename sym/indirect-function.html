<h3>Function: indirect-function</h3>
<p>
Return the function at the end of OBJECT's function chain.
If OBJECT is not a symbol, just return it.  Otherwise, follow all
function indirections to find the final function binding and return it.
If the final symbol in the chain is unbound, signal a void-function error.
Optional arg NOERROR non-nil means to return nil instead of signaling.
Signal a cyclic-function-indirection error if there is a loop in the
function chain of symbols.</p>
