<h3>Variable: translation-table-for-input</h3>
<p>
Char table for translating self-inserting characters.<br>
This is applied to the result of input methods, not their input.<br>
See also `keyboard-translate-table'.<br>
<br>
Use of this variable for character code unification was rendered<br>
obsolete in Emacs 23.1 and later, since Unicode is now the basis of<br>
internal character representation.</p>
