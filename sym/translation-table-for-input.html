<h3>Variable: translation-table-for-input</h3>
<p>
Char table for translating self-inserting characters.
This is applied to the result of input methods, not their input.
See also `keyboard-translate-table'.</p>
<p>
Use of this variable for character code unification was rendered
obsolete in Emacs 23.1 and later, since Unicode is now the basis of
internal character representation.</p>
