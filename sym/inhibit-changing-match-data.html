<h3>Variable: inhibit-changing-match-data</h3>
<p>
Internal use only.<br>
If non-nil, the primitive searching and matching functions<br>
such as `looking-at', `string-match', `re-search-forward', etc.,<br>
do not set the match data.  The proper way to use this variable<br>
is to bind it with `let' around a small expression.</p>
