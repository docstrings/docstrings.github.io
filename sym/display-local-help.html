<h3>Function: display-local-help</h3>
<p>
Display local help in the echo area.<br>
This displays a short help message, namely the string produced by<br>
the `kbd-help' property at point.  If `kbd-help' does not produce<br>
a string, but the `help-echo' property does, then that string is<br>
printed instead.<br>
<br>
A numeric argument ARG prevents display of a message in case<br>
there is no help.  While ARG can be used interactively, it is<br>
mainly meant for use from Lisp.
