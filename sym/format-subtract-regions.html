<h3>Function: format-subtract-regions</h3>
<p>
Remove from the regions in MINUEND the regions in SUBTRAHEND.<br>
A region is a dotted pair (FROM . TO).  Both parameters are lists of<br>
regions.  Each list must contain nonoverlapping, noncontiguous<br>
regions, in descending order.  The result is also nonoverlapping,<br>
noncontiguous, and in descending order.  The first element of MINUEND<br>
can have a cdr of nil, indicating that the end of that region is not<br>
yet known.<br>
