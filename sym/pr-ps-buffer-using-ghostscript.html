<h3>Function: pr-ps-buffer-using-ghostscript</h3>
<p>
Print buffer using PostScript through ghostscript.</p>
<p>
Interactively, the command prompts for N-UP printing number and, when you use a
prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the user for a file name, and saves
the PostScript image in that file instead of sending it to the printer.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, if N-UP is nil, prompts for N-UP printing number.  The
argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it's nil, send the image to the
printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save the PostScript image in a file with
that name.  If FILENAME is t, prompts for a file name.</p>
<p>
(fn N-UP &optional FILENAME)</p>
