<h3>Function: isearch-highlight-regexp</h3>
<p>
Run `highlight-regexp' with regexp from the current search string.
It exits Isearch mode and calls `hi-lock-face-buffer' with its regexp
argument from the last search regexp or a quoted search string,
and reads its face argument using `hi-lock-read-face-name'.</p>
