<h3>Function: count-screen-lines</h3>
<p>
Return the number of screen lines in the region.<br>
The number of screen lines may be different from the number of actual lines,<br>
due to line breaking, display table, etc.<br>
<br>
Optional arguments BEG and END default to `point-min' and `point-max'<br>
respectively.<br>
<br>
If region ends with a newline, ignore it unless optional third argument<br>
COUNT-FINAL-NEWLINE is non-nil.<br>
<br>
The optional fourth argument WINDOW specifies the window used for obtaining<br>
parameters such as width, horizontal scrolling, and so on.  The default is<br>
to use the selected window's parameters.<br>
<br>
Like `vertical-motion', `count-screen-lines' always uses the current buffer,<br>
regardless of which buffer is displayed in WINDOW.  This makes possible to use<br>
`count-screen-lines' in any buffer, whether or not it is currently displayed
in some window.</p>
