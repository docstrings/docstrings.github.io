<h3>Function: count-screen-lines</h3>
<p>
Return the number of screen lines in the region.
The number of screen lines may be different from the number of actual lines,
due to line breaking, display table, etc.</p>
<p>
Optional arguments BEG and END default to `point-min' and `point-max'
respectively.</p>
<p>
If region ends with a newline, ignore it unless optional third argument
COUNT-FINAL-NEWLINE is non-nil.</p>
<p>
The optional fourth argument WINDOW specifies the window used for obtaining
parameters such as width, horizontal scrolling, and so on.  The default is
to use the selected window's parameters.</p>
<p>
Like `vertical-motion', `count-screen-lines' always uses the current buffer,
regardless of which buffer is displayed in WINDOW.  This makes possible to use
`count-screen-lines' in any buffer, whether or not it is currently displayed
in some window.</p>
