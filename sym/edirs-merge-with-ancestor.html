<h3>Function: edirs-merge-with-ancestor</h3>
<p>
Merge files in directories DIR1 and DIR2 using files in ANCESTOR-DIR as ancestors.
Ediff merges files that have identical names in DIR1, DIR2.  If a pair of files
in DIR1 and DIR2 doesn't have an ancestor in ANCESTOR-DIR, Ediff will merge
without ancestor.  The fourth argument, REGEXP, is nil or a regular expression;
only file names that match the regexp are considered.</p>
