<h3>Variable: Info-virtual-nodes</h3>
<p>
List of definitions of virtual Info nodes.
Each element of the list has the format (NODENAME (OPERATION . HANDLER) ...)
where NODENAME is a regexp that matches a class of virtual Info node names.
It should be carefully chosen to not cause node name clashes with
existing node names.  OPERATION is one of the following operation
symbols `find-node' that define what HANDLER function to call instead
of calling the default corresponding function to override it.</p>
