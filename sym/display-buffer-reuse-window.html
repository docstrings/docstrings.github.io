<h3>Function: display-buffer-reuse-window</h3>
<p>
Return a window that is already displaying BUFFER.
Return nil if no usable window is found.</p>
<p>
If ALIST has a non-nil `inhibit-same-window' entry, the selected
window is not eligible for reuse.</p>
<p>
If ALIST contains a `reusable-frames' entry, its value determines
which frames to search for a reusable window:
  nil -- the selected frame (actually the last non-minibuffer frame)
  A frame   -- just that frame
  `visible' -- all visible frames
  0   -- all frames on the current terminal
  t   -- all frames.</p>
<p>
If ALIST contains no `reusable-frames' entry, search just the
selected frame if `display-buffer-reuse-frames' and
`pop-up-frames' are both nil; search all frames on the current
terminal if either of those variables is non-nil.</p>
<p>
If ALIST has a non-nil `inhibit-switch-frame' entry, then in the
event that a window on another frame is chosen, avoid raising
that frame.</p>
