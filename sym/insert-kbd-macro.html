<h3>Function: insert-kbd-macro</h3>
<p>
Insert in buffer the definition of kbd macro NAME, as Lisp code.
Optional second arg KEYS means also record the keys it is on
(this is the prefix argument, when calling interactively).</p>
<p>
This Lisp code will, when executed, define the kbd macro with the same
definition it has now.  If you say to record the keys, the Lisp code
will also rebind those keys to the macro.  Only global key bindings
are recorded since executing this Lisp code always makes global
bindings.</p>
<p>
To save a kbd macro, visit a file of Lisp code such as your `~/.emacs',
use this command, and then save the file.</p>
