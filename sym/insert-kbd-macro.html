<h3>Function: insert-kbd-macro</h3>
<p>
Insert in buffer the definition of kbd macro NAME, as Lisp code.<br>
Optional second arg KEYS means also record the keys it is on<br>
(this is the prefix argument, when calling interactively).<br>
<br>
This Lisp code will, when executed, define the kbd macro with the same<br>
definition it has now.  If you say to record the keys, the Lisp code<br>
will also rebind those keys to the macro.  Only global key bindings<br>
are recorded since executing this Lisp code always makes global<br>
bindings.<br>
<br>
To save a kbd macro, visit a file of Lisp code such as your `~/.emacs',<br>
use this command, and then save the file.
