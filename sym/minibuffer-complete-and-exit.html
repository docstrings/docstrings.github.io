<h3>Function: minibuffer-complete-and-exit</h3>
<p>
Exit if the minibuffer contains a valid completion.
Otherwise, try to complete the minibuffer contents.  If
completion leads to a valid completion, a repetition of this
command will exit.</p>
<p>
If `minibuffer-completion-confirm' is `confirm', do not try to
 complete; instead, ask for confirmation and accept any input if
 confirmed.
If `minibuffer-completion-confirm' is `confirm-after-completion',
 do not try to complete; instead, ask for confirmation if the
 preceding minibuffer command was a member of
 `minibuffer-confirm-exit-commands', and accept the input
 otherwise.</p>
