<h3>Function: find-buffer-visiting</h3>
<p>
Return the buffer visiting file FILENAME (a string).<br>
This is like `get-file-buffer', except that it checks for any buffer<br>
visiting the same file, possibly under a different name.<br>
If PREDICATE is non-nil, only buffers satisfying it are eligible,<br>
and others are ignored.<br>
If there is no such live buffer, return nil.</p>
