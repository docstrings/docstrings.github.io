<h3>Function: split-window-right</h3>
<p>
Split the selected window into two side-by-side windows.
The selected window is on the left.  The newly split-off window
is on the right, and displays the same buffer.  Return the new
window.</p>
<p>
If optional argument SIZE is omitted or nil, both windows get the
same width, or close to it.  If SIZE is positive, the left-hand
(selected) window gets SIZE columns.  If SIZE is negative, the
right-hand (new) window gets -SIZE columns.  Here, SIZE includes
the width of the window's scroll bar; if there are no scroll
bars, it includes the width of the divider column to the window's
right, if any.</p>
