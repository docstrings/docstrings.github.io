<h3>Function: directory-files-and-attributes</h3>
<p>
Return a list of names of files and their attributes in DIRECTORY.
There are four optional arguments:
If FULL is non-nil, return absolute file names.  Otherwise return names
 that are relative to the specified directory.
If MATCH is non-nil, mention only file names that match the regexp MATCH.
If NOSORT is non-nil, the list is not sorted--its order is unpredictable.
 NOSORT is useful if you plan to sort the result yourself.
ID-FORMAT specifies the preferred format of attributes uid and gid, see
`file-attributes' for further documentation.
On MS-Windows, performance depends on `w32-get-true-file-attributes',
which see.</p>
