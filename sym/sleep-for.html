<h3>Function: sleep-for</h3>
<p>
Pause, without updating display, for SECONDS seconds.<br>
SECONDS may be a floating-point value, meaning that you can wait for a<br>
fraction of a second.  Optional second arg MILLISECONDS specifies an<br>
additional wait period, in milliseconds; this is for backwards compatibility.<br>
(Not all operating systems support waiting for a fraction of a second.)<br>
