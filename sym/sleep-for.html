<h3>Function: sleep-for</h3>
<p>
Pause, without updating display, for SECONDS seconds.
SECONDS may be a floating-point value, meaning that you can wait for a
fraction of a second.  Optional second arg MILLISECONDS specifies an
additional wait period, in milliseconds; this is for backwards compatibility.
(Not all operating systems support waiting for a fraction of a second.)</p>
