<h3>Variable: term-file-prefix</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, Emacs startup performs terminal-specific initialization.<br>
It does this by: (load (concat term-file-prefix (getenv "TERM")))<br>
<br>
You may set this variable to nil in your init file if you do not wish<br>
the terminal-initialization file to be loaded.</p>
