<h3>Variable: term-file-prefix</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, Emacs startup performs terminal-specific initialization.
It does this by: (load (concat term-file-prefix (getenv "TERM")))</p>
<p>
You may set this variable to nil in your init file if you do not wish
the terminal-initialization file to be loaded.</p>
