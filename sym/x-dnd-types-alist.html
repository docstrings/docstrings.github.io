<h3>Variable: x-dnd-types-alist</h3>
<p>
Which function to call to handle a drop of that type.<br>
If the type for the drop is not present, or the function is nil,<br>
the drop is rejected.  The function takes three arguments, WINDOW, ACTION<br>
and DATA.  WINDOW is where the drop occurred, ACTION is the action for<br>
this drop (copy, move, link, private or ask) as determined by a previous<br>
call to `x-dnd-test-function'.  DATA is the drop data.<br>
The function shall return the action used (copy, move, link or private)<br>
if drop is successful, nil if not.</p>
