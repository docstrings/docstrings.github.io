<h3>Function: subword-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle subword movement and editing (Subword mode).<br>
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Subword mode if ARG is<br>
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable<br>
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.<br>
<br>
Subword mode is a buffer-local minor mode.  Enabling it remaps<br>
word-based editing commands to subword-based commands that handle<br>
symbols with mixed uppercase and lowercase letters,<br>
e.g. "GtkWidget", "EmacsFrameClass", "NSGraphicsContext".<br>
<br>
Here we call these mixed case symbols `nomenclatures'.  Each<br>
capitalized (or completely uppercase) part of a nomenclature is<br>
called a `subword'.  Here are some examples:<br>
<br>
  Nomenclature           Subwords<br>
  ===========================================================<br>
  GtkWindow          =>  "Gtk" and "Window"<br>
  EmacsFrameClass    =>  "Emacs", "Frame" and "Class"<br>
  NSGraphicsContext  =>  "NS", "Graphics" and "Context"<br>
<br>
The subword oriented commands activated in this minor mode recognize<br>
subwords in a nomenclature to move between subwords and to edit them<br>
as words.


Uses keymap `subword-mode-map', which is not currently defined.
