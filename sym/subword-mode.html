<h3>Function: subword-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle subword movement and editing (Subword mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Subword mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Subword mode is a buffer-local minor mode.  Enabling it remaps
word-based editing commands to subword-based commands that handle
symbols with mixed uppercase and lowercase letters,
e.g. "GtkWidget", "EmacsFrameClass", "NSGraphicsContext".</p>
<p>
Here we call these mixed case symbols `nomenclatures'.  Each
capitalized (or completely uppercase) part of a nomenclature is
called a `subword'.  Here are some examples:</p>
<p>
  Nomenclature           Subwords
  ===========================================================
  GtkWindow          =>  "Gtk" and "Window"
  EmacsFrameClass    =>  "Emacs", "Frame" and "Class"
  NSGraphicsContext  =>  "NS", "Graphics" and "Context"</p>
<p>
The subword oriented commands activated in this minor mode recognize
subwords in a nomenclature to move between subwords and to edit them
as words.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `subword-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
