<h3>Function: gnus-agent-rename-group</h3>
<p>
Rename fully-qualified OLD-GROUP as NEW-GROUP.<br>
Always updates the agent, even when disabled, as the old agent<br>
files would corrupt gnus when the agent was next enabled.<br>
Depends upon the caller to determine whether group renaming is<br>
supported.<br>
<br>
(fn OLD-GROUP NEW-GROUP)</p>
