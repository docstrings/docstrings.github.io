<h3>Variable: package-archive-contents</h3>
<p>
Cache of the contents of the Emacs Lisp Package Archive.<br>
This is an alist mapping package names (symbols) to package<br>
descriptor vectors.  These are like the vectors for `package-alist'<br>
but have extra entries: one which is 'tar for tar packages and<br>
'single for single-file packages, and one which is the name of<br>
the archive from which it came.</p>
