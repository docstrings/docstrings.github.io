<h3>Function: sh-execute-region</h3>
<p>
Pass optional header and region to a subshell for noninteractive execution.<br>
The working directory is that of the buffer, and only environment variables<br>
are already set which is why you can mark a header within the script.<br>
<br>
With a positive prefix ARG, instead of sending region, define header from<br>
beginning of buffer to point.  With a negative prefix ARG, instead of sending<br>
region, clear header.</p>
