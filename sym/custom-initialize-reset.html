<h3>Function: custom-initialize-reset</h3>
<p>
Initialize SYMBOL based on VALUE.
Set the symbol, using its `:set' function (or `set-default' if it has none).
The value is either the symbol's current value
 (as obtained using the `:get' function), if any,
or the value in the symbol's `saved-value' property if any,
or (last of all) VALUE.</p>
