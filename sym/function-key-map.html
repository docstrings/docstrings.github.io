<h3>Variable: function-key-map</h3>
<p>
The parent keymap of all `local-function-key-map' instances.<br>
Function key definitions that apply to all terminal devices should go<br>
here.  If a mapping is defined in both the current<br>
`local-function-key-map' binding and this variable, then the local<br>
definition will take precedence.</p>
