<h3>Function: shell-filter-ctrl-a-ctrl-b</h3>
<p>
Remove `^A' and `^B' characters from comint output.</p>
<p>
Bash uses these characters as internal quoting characters in its
prompt.  Due to a bug in some bash versions (including 2.03,
2.04, and 2.05b), they may erroneously show up when bash is
started with the `--noediting' option and Select Graphic
Rendition (SGR) control sequences (formerly known as ANSI escape
sequences) are used to color the prompt.</p>
<p>
This function can be put on `comint-preoutput-filter-functions'.</p>
<p>
(fn STRING)</p>
