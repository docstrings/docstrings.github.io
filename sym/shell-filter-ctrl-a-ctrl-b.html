<h3>Function: shell-filter-ctrl-a-ctrl-b</h3>
<p>
Remove `^A' and `^B' characters from comint output.<br>
<br>
Bash uses these characters as internal quoting characters in its<br>
prompt.  Due to a bug in some bash versions (including 2.03,<br>
2.04, and 2.05b), they may erroneously show up when bash is<br>
started with the `--noediting' option and Select Graphic<br>
Rendition (SGR) control sequences (formerly known as ANSI escape<br>
sequences) are used to color the prompt.<br>
<br>
This function can be put on `comint-preoutput-filter-functions'.
