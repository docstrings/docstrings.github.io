<h3>Variable: vc-follow-symlinks</h3>
<p>
What to do if visiting a symbolic link to a file under version control.
Editing such a file through the link bypasses the version control system,
which is dangerous and probably not what you want.</p>
<p>
If this variable is t, VC follows the link and visits the real file,
telling you about it in the echo area.  If it is `ask', VC asks for
confirmation whether it should follow the link.  If nil, the link is
visited and a warning displayed.</p>
