<h3>Function: ansi-color-apply-on-region</h3>
<p>
Translates SGR control sequences into overlays or extents.
Delete all other control sequences without processing them.</p>
<p>
SGR control sequences are applied by calling the function
specified by `ansi-color-apply-face-function'.  The default
function sets foreground and background colors to the text
between BEGIN and END, using overlays.  The colors used are given
in `ansi-color-faces-vector' and `ansi-color-names-vector'.  See
`ansi-color-apply-sequence' for details.</p>
<p>
Every call to this function will set and use the buffer-local
variable `ansi-color-context-region' to save position and current
ansi codes.  This information will be used for the next call to
`ansi-color-apply-on-region'.  Specifically, it will override
BEGIN, the start of the region and set the face with which to
start.  Set `ansi-color-context-region' to nil if you don't want
this.</p>
