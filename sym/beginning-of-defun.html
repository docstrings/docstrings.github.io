<h3>Function: beginning-of-defun</h3>
<p>
Move backward to the beginning of a defun.
With ARG, do it that many times.  Negative ARG means move forward
to the ARGth following beginning of defun.</p>
<p>
If search is successful, return t; point ends up at the beginning
of the line where the search succeeded.  Otherwise, return nil.</p>
<p>
When `open-paren-in-column-0-is-defun-start' is non-nil, a defun
is assumed to start where there is a char with open-parenthesis
syntax at the beginning of a line.  If `defun-prompt-regexp' is
non-nil, then a string which matches that regexp may also precede
the open-parenthesis.  If `defun-prompt-regexp' and
`open-paren-in-column-0-is-defun-start' are both nil, this
function instead finds an open-paren at the outermost level.</p>
<p>
If the variable `beginning-of-defun-function' is non-nil, its
value is called as a function, with argument ARG, to find the
defun's beginning.</p>
<p>
Regardless of the values of `defun-prompt-regexp' and
`beginning-of-defun-function', point always moves to the
beginning of the line whenever the search is successful.</p>
