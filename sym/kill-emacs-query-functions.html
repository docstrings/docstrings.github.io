<h3>Variable: kill-emacs-query-functions</h3>
<p>
Functions to call with no arguments to query about killing Emacs.<br>
If any of these functions returns nil, killing Emacs is canceled.<br>
`save-buffers-kill-emacs' calls these functions, but `kill-emacs',<br>
the low level primitive, does not.  See also `kill-emacs-hook'.</p>
