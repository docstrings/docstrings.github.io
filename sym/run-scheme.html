<h3>Function: run-scheme</h3>
<p>
Run an inferior Scheme process, input and output via buffer `*scheme*'.
If there is a process already running in `*scheme*', switch to that buffer.
With argument, allows you to edit the command line (default is value
of `scheme-program-name').
If the file `~/.emacs_SCHEMENAME' or `~/.emacs.d/init_SCHEMENAME.scm' exists,
it is given as initial input.
Note that this may lose due to a timing error if the Scheme processor
discards input when it starts up.
Runs the hook `inferior-scheme-mode-hook' (after the `comint-mode-hook'
is run).
(Type C-h m in the process buffer for a list of commands.)</p>
