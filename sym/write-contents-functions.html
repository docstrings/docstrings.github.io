<h3>Variable: write-contents-functions</h3>
<p>
List of functions to be called before writing out a buffer to a file.<br>
If one of them returns non-nil, the file is considered already written<br>
and the rest are not called and neither are the functions in<br>
`write-file-functions'.<br>
<br>
This variable is meant to be used for hooks that pertain to the<br>
buffer's contents, not to the particular visited file; thus,<br>
`set-visited-file-name' does not clear this variable; but changing the<br>
major mode does clear it.<br>
<br>
For hooks that _do_ pertain to the particular visited file, use<br>
`write-file-functions'.  Both this variable and<br>
`write-file-functions' relate to how a buffer is saved to file.<br>
To perform various checks or updates before the buffer is saved,
use `before-save-hook'.</p>
