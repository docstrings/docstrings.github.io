<h3>Function: frame-geom-value-cons</h3>
<p>
Return equivalent geometry value for FRAME as a cons with car `+'.
A geometry value equivalent to VALUE for FRAME is returned,
where the value is a cons with car `+', not numeric.
TYPE is the car of the original geometry spec (TYPE . VALUE).
   It is `top' or `left', depending on which edge VALUE is related to.
VALUE is the cdr of a frame geometry spec: (left/top . VALUE).
If VALUE is a number, then it is converted to a cons value, perhaps
   relative to the opposite frame edge from that in the original spec.
FRAME defaults to the selected frame.</p>

Examples (measures in pixels) -
 Assuming display height/width=1024, frame height/width=600:
 300 inside display edge:                   300  => (+  300)
                                        (+  300) => (+  300)
 300 inside opposite display edge:      (-  300) => (+  124)
                                           -300  => (+  124)
 300 beyond display edge
  (= 724 inside opposite display edge): (+ -300) => (+ -300)
 300 beyond display edge
  (= 724 inside opposite display edge): (- -300) => (+  724)</p>
<p>
In the 3rd, 4th, and 6th examples, the returned value is relative to
the opposite frame edge from the edge indicated in the input spec.</p>
