<h3>Function: gdb</h3>
<p>
Run gdb on program FILE in buffer *gud-FILE*.
The directory containing FILE becomes the initial working directory
and source-file directory for your debugger.</p>
<p>
COMMAND-LINE is the shell command for starting the gdb session.
It should be a string consisting of the name of the gdb
executable followed by command-line options.  The command-line
options should include "-i=mi" to use gdb's MI text interface.
Note that the old "--annotate" option is no longer supported.</p>
<p>
If `gdb-many-windows' is nil (the default value) then gdb just
pops up the GUD buffer unless `gdb-show-main' is t.  In this case
it starts with two windows: one displaying the GUD buffer and the
other with the source file with the main routine of the inferior.</p>
<p>
If `gdb-many-windows' is t, regardless of the value of
`gdb-show-main', the layout below will appear.  Keybindings are
shown in some of the buffers.</p>
<p>
Watch expressions appear in the speedbar/slowbar.</p>
<p>
The following commands help control operation :</p>
<p>
`gdb-many-windows'    - Toggle the number of windows gdb uses.
`gdb-restore-windows' - To restore the window layout.</p>
<p>
See Info node `(emacs)GDB Graphical Interface' for a more
detailed description of this mode.</p>
