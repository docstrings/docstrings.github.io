<h3>Variable: ctext-standard-encodings</h3>
<p>
List of approved standard encodings (i.e. charsets) of X's Compound Text.<br>
Coding-system `compound-text-with-extensions' encodes a character<br>
belonging to any of those charsets using the normal ISO2022<br>
designation sequence unless the current language environment or<br>
the variable `ctext-non-standard-encodings' decide to use an extended<br>
segment of CTEXT for that character.  See also the documentation<br>
of `ctext-non-standard-encodings-alist'.</p>
