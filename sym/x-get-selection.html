<h3>Function: x-get-selection</h3>
<p>
Return the value of an X Windows selection.
The argument TYPE (default `PRIMARY') says which selection,
and the argument DATA-TYPE (default `STRING') says
how to convert the data.</p>
<p>
TYPE may be any symbol (but nil stands for `PRIMARY').  However,
only a few symbols are commonly used.  They conventionally have
all upper-case names.  The most often used ones, in addition to
`PRIMARY', are `SECONDARY' and `CLIPBOARD'.</p>
<p>
DATA-TYPE is usually `STRING', but can also be one of the symbols
in `selection-converter-alist', which see.</p>
