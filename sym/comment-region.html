<h3>Function: comment-region</h3>
<p>
Comment or uncomment each line in the region.<br>
With just C-u prefix arg, uncomment each line in region BEG .. END.<br>
Numeric prefix ARG means use ARG comment characters.<br>
If ARG is negative, delete that many comment characters instead.<br>
<br>
The strings used as comment starts are built from `comment-start'<br>
and `comment-padding'; the strings used as comment ends are built<br>
from `comment-end' and `comment-padding'.<br>
<br>
By default, the `comment-start' markers are inserted at the<br>
current indentation of the region, and comments are terminated on<br>
each line (even for syntaxes in which newline does not end the<br>
comment and blank lines do not get comments).  This can be<br>
changed with `comment-style'.
