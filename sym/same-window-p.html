<h3>Function: same-window-p</h3>
<p>
Return non-nil if a buffer named BUFFER-NAME would be shown in the "same" window.
This function returns non-nil if `display-buffer' or
`pop-to-buffer' would show a buffer named BUFFER-NAME in the
selected rather than (as usual) some other window.  See
`same-window-buffer-names' and `same-window-regexps'.</p>
