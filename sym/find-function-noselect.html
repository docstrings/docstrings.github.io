<h3>Function: find-function-noselect</h3>
<p>
Return a pair (BUFFER . POINT) pointing to the definition of FUNCTION.</p>
<p>
Finds the source file containing the definition of FUNCTION
in a buffer and the point of the definition.  The buffer is
not selected.  If the function definition can't be found in
the buffer, returns (BUFFER).</p>
<p>
If FUNCTION is a built-in function, this function normally
attempts to find it in the Emacs C sources; however, if LISP-ONLY
is non-nil, signal an error instead.</p>
<p>
If the file where FUNCTION is defined is not known, then it is
searched for in `find-function-source-path' if non-nil, otherwise
in `load-path'.</p>
<p>
(fn FUNCTION &optional LISP-ONLY)</p>
