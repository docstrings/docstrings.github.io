<h3>Function: compile</h3>
<p>
Compile the program including the current buffer.  Default: run `make'.
Runs COMMAND, a shell command, in a separate process asynchronously
with output going to the buffer `*compilation*'.</p>
<p>
You can then use the command C-x ` to find the next error message
and move to the source code that caused it.</p>
<p>
If optional second arg COMINT is t the buffer will be in Comint mode with
`compilation-shell-minor-mode'.</p>
<p>
Interactively, prompts for the command if `compilation-read-command' is
non-nil; otherwise uses `compile-command'.  With prefix arg, always prompts.
Additionally, with universal prefix arg, compilation buffer will be in
comint mode, i.e. interactive.</p>
<p>
To run more than one compilation at once, start one then rename
the `*compilation*' buffer to some other name with
M-x rename-buffer.  Then _switch buffers_ and start the new compilation.
It will create a new `*compilation*' buffer.</p>
<p>
On most systems, termination of the main compilation process
kills its subprocesses.</p>
<p>
The name used for the buffer is actually whatever is returned by
the function in `compilation-buffer-name-function', so you can set that
to a function that generates a unique name.</p>
<p>
(fn COMMAND &optional COMINT)</p>
