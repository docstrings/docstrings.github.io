<h3>Function: font-lock-match-c-style-declaration-item-and-skip-to-next</h3>
<p>
Match, and move over, any declaration/definition item after point.
Matches after point, but ignores leading whitespace and `*' characters.
Does not move further than LIMIT.</p>
<p>
The expected syntax of a declaration/definition item is `word' (preceded by
optional whitespace and `*' characters and proceeded by optional whitespace)
optionally followed by a `('.  Everything following the item (but belonging to
it) is expected to be skip-able by `scan-sexps', and items are expected to be
separated with a `,' and to be terminated with a `;'.</p>
<p>
Thus the regexp matches after point:	word (
					^^^^ ^
Where the match subexpressions are:	  1  2</p>
<p>
The item is delimited by (match-beginning 1) and (match-end 1).
If (match-beginning 2) is non-nil, the item is followed by a `('.</p>
<p>
This function could be MATCHER in a MATCH-ANCHORED `font-lock-keywords' item.</p>
