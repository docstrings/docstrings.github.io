<h3>Function: mh-smail-batch</h3>
<p>
Compose a message with the MH mail system.<br>
<br>
This function does not prompt the user for any header fields, and<br>
thus is suitable for use by programs that want to create a mail<br>
buffer. Users should use M-x mh-smail to compose mail.<br>
<br>
Optional arguments for setting certain fields include TO,<br>
SUBJECT, and OTHER-HEADERS. Additional arguments are IGNORED.<br>
<br>
This function remains for Emacs 21 compatibility. New<br>
applications should use `mh-user-agent-compose'.<br>
<br>
