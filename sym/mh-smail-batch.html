<h3>Function: mh-smail-batch</h3>
<p>
Compose a message with the MH mail system.</p>
<p>
This function does not prompt the user for any header fields, and
thus is suitable for use by programs that want to create a mail
buffer. Users should use M-x mh-smail to compose mail.</p>
<p>
Optional arguments for setting certain fields include TO,
SUBJECT, and OTHER-HEADERS. Additional arguments are IGNORED.</p>
<p>
This function remains for Emacs 21 compatibility. New
applications should use `mh-user-agent-compose'.</p>
