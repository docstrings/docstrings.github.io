<h3>Function: format-replace-strings</h3>
<p>
Do multiple replacements on the buffer.
ALIST is a list of (FROM . TO) pairs, which should be proper arguments to
`search-forward' and `replace-match', respectively.
Optional second arg REVERSE, if non-nil, means the pairs are (TO . FROM),
so that you can use the same list in both directions if it contains only
literal strings.
Optional args BEG and END specify a region of the buffer on which to operate.</p>
