<h3>Function: kill-rectangle</h3>
<p>
Delete the region-rectangle and save it as the last killed one.<br>
<br>
When called from a program the rectangle's corners are START and END.<br>
You might prefer to use `delete-extract-rectangle' from a program.<br>
<br>
With a prefix (or a FILL) argument, also fill lines where nothing has to be<br>
deleted.<br>
<br>
If the buffer is read-only, Emacs will beep and refrain from deleting<br>
the rectangle, but put it in the kill ring anyway.  This means that<br>
you can use this command to copy text from a read-only buffer.<br>
(If the variable `kill-read-only-ok' is non-nil, then this won't
even beep.)

(fn START END &optional FILL)</p>
