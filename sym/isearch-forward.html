<h3>Function: isearch-forward</h3>
<p>
Do incremental search forward.
With a prefix argument, do an incremental regular expression search instead.</p>
<p>
As you type characters, they add to the search string and are found.
The following non-printing keys are bound in `isearch-mode-map'.</p>
<p>
Type DEL to cancel last input item from end of search string.
Type RET to exit, leaving point at location found.
Type LFD (C-j) to match end of line.
Type C-s to search again forward, C-r to search again backward.
Type C-w to yank next word or character in buffer
  onto the end of the search string, and search for it.
Type C-M-w to delete character from end of search string.
Type C-M-y to yank char from buffer onto end of search string and search for it.
Type M-s C-e to yank rest of line onto end of search string and search for it.
Type C-y to yank the last string of killed text.
Type M-y to replace string just yanked into search prompt
 with string killed before it.
Type C-q to quote control character to search for it.
C-g while searching or when search has failed cancels input back to what has
 been found successfully.
C-g when search is successful aborts and moves point to starting point.</p>
<p>
If you try to exit with the search string still empty, it invokes
 nonincremental search.</p>
<p>
Type M-c to toggle search case-sensitivity.
Type M-r to toggle regular-expression mode.
Type M-s w to toggle word mode.
Type M-s _ to toggle symbol mode.</p>
<p>
Type M-s SPC to toggle whitespace matching.
In incremental searches, a space or spaces normally matches any whitespace
defined by the variable `search-whitespace-regexp'; see also the variables
`isearch-lax-whitespace' and `isearch-regexp-lax-whitespace'.</p>
<p>
Type M-e to edit the search string in the minibuffer.</p>
<p>
Also supported is a search ring of the previous 16 search strings.
Type M-n to search for the next item in the search ring.
Type M-p to search for the previous item in the search ring.
Type C-M-i to complete the search string using the search ring.</p>
<p>
Type M-% to run `query-replace' with string to replace from last search string.
Type C-M-% to run `query-replace-regexp' with the last search string.
Type M-s o to run `occur' that shows the last search string.
Type M-s h r to run `highlight-regexp' that highlights the last search string.</p>
<p>
Type C-h b to display all Isearch key bindings.
Type C-h k to display documentation of Isearch key.
Type C-h m to display documentation of Isearch mode.</p>
<p>
If an input method is turned on in the current buffer, that input
method is also active while you are typing characters to search.
To toggle the input method, type C-\.  It also toggles the input
method in the current buffer.</p>
<p>
To use a different input method for searching, type C-^,
and specify an input method you want to use.</p>
<p>
The above keys, bound in `isearch-mode-map', are often controlled by
 options; do M-x apropos on search-.* to find them.
Other control and meta characters terminate the search
 and are then executed normally (depending on `search-exit-option').
Likewise for function keys and mouse button events.</p>
<p>
If this function is called non-interactively, it does not return to
the calling function until the search is done.</p>
