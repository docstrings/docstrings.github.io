<h3>Function: byte-compile-lambda</h3>
<p>
Byte-compile a lambda-expression and return a valid function.<br>
The value is usually a compiled function but may be the original<br>
lambda-expression.<br>
When ADD-LAMBDA is non-nil, the symbol `lambda' is added as head<br>
of the list FUN and `byte-compile-set-symbol-position' is not called.<br>
Use this feature to avoid calling `byte-compile-set-symbol-position'<br>
for symbols generated by the byte compiler itself.<br>
<br>
(fn FUN &optional ADD-LAMBDA RESERVED-CSTS)</p>
