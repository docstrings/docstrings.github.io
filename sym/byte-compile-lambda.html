<h3>Function: byte-compile-lambda</h3>
<p>
Byte-compile a lambda-expression and return a valid function.
The value is usually a compiled function but may be the original
lambda-expression.
When ADD-LAMBDA is non-nil, the symbol `lambda' is added as head
of the list FUN and `byte-compile-set-symbol-position' is not called.
Use this feature to avoid calling `byte-compile-set-symbol-position'
for symbols generated by the byte compiler itself.</p>
