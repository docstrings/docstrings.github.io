<h3>Function: overwrite-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle Overwrite mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Overwrite mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When Overwrite mode is enabled, printing characters typed in
replace existing text on a one-for-one basis, rather than pushing
it to the right.  At the end of a line, such characters extend
the line.  Before a tab, such characters insert until the tab is
filled in.  C-q still inserts characters in
overwrite mode; this is supposed to make it easier to insert
characters when necessary.</p>
<h3>Variable: overwrite-mode</h3>
<p>
Non-nil if self-insertion should replace existing text.
The value should be one of `overwrite-mode-textual',
`overwrite-mode-binary', or nil.
If it is `overwrite-mode-textual', self-insertion still
inserts at the end of a line, and inserts when point is before a tab,
until the tab is filled in.
If `overwrite-mode-binary', self-insertion replaces newlines and tabs too.</p>
