<h3>Variable: initial-window-system</h3>
<p>
Name of the window system that Emacs uses for the first frame.
The value is a symbol:
 nil for a termcap frame (a character-only terminal),
 'x' for an Emacs frame that is really an X window,
 'w32' for an Emacs frame that is a window on MS-Windows display,
 'ns' for an Emacs frame on a GNUstep or Macintosh Cocoa display,
 'pc' for a direct-write MS-DOS frame.</p>
<p>
Use of this variable as a boolean is deprecated.  Instead,
use `display-graphic-p' or any of the other `display-*-p'
predicates which report frame's specific UI-related capabilities.</p>
