<h3>Function: set-case-syntax-delims</h3>
<p>
Make characters L and R a matching pair of non-case-converting delimiters.
This sets the entries for L and R in TABLE, which is a string
that will be used as the downcase part of a case table.
It also modifies `standard-syntax-table' to
indicate left and right delimiters.</p>
