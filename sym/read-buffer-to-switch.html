<h3>Function: read-buffer-to-switch</h3>
<p>
Read the name of a buffer to switch to, prompting with PROMPT.
Return the name of the buffer as a string.</p>
<p>
This function is intended for the `switch-to-buffer' family of
commands since these need to omit the name of the current buffer
from the list of completions and default values.</p>
