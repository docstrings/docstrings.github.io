<h3>Function: gnus-remassoc</h3>
<p>
Delete by side effect any elements of LIST whose car is `equal' to KEY.
The modified LIST is returned.  If the first member
of LIST has a car that is `equal' to KEY, there is no way to remove it
by side effect; therefore, write `(setq foo (gnus-remassoc key foo))' to be
sure of changing the value of `foo'.</p>
