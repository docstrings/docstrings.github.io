<h3>Variable: custom-enabled-themes</h3>
<p>
List of enabled Custom Themes, highest precedence first.<br>
This list does not include the `user' theme, which is set by<br>
Customize and always takes precedence over other Custom Themes.<br>
<br>
This variable cannot be defined inside a Custom theme; there, it<br>
is simply ignored.<br>
<br>
Setting this variable through Customize calls `enable-theme' or<br>
`load-theme' for each theme in the list.</p>
