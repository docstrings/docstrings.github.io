<h3>Variable: imagemagick-types-inhibit</h3>
<p>
List of ImageMagick types that should never be treated as images.
This should be a list of symbols, each of which should be one of
the ImageMagick types listed by `imagemagick-types'.  The listed
image types are not registered by `imagemagick-register-types'.</p>
<p>
If the value is t, inhibit the use of ImageMagick for images.</p>
<p>
If you change this without using customize, you must call
`imagemagick-register-types' afterwards.</p>
<p>
If Emacs is compiled without ImageMagick support, this variable
has no effect.</p>
