<h3>Variable: imagemagick-types-inhibit</h3>
<p>
List of ImageMagick types that should never be treated as images.<br>
This should be a list of symbols, each of which should be one of<br>
the ImageMagick types listed by `imagemagick-types'.  The listed<br>
image types are not registered by `imagemagick-register-types'.<br>
<br>
If the value is t, inhibit the use of ImageMagick for images.<br>
<br>
If you change this without using customize, you must call<br>
`imagemagick-register-types' afterwards.<br>
<br>
If Emacs is compiled without ImageMagick support, this variable
has no effect.</p>
