<h3>Variable: bidi-paragraph-direction</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, forces directionality of text paragraphs in the buffer.<br>
<br>
If this is nil (the default), the direction of each paragraph is<br>
determined by the first strong directional character of its text.<br>
The values of `right-to-left' and `left-to-right' override that.<br>
Any other value is treated as nil.<br>
<br>
This variable has no effect unless the buffer's value of<br>
`bidi-display-reordering' is non-nil.</p>
