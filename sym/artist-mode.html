<p>
		* Straight lines can only go horizontally, vertically
		  or diagonally.</p>
<p>
		* Poly-lines are drawn while holding mouse-1 down.  When you
		  release the button, the point is set.  If you want a segment
		  to be straight, hold down shift before pressing the
		  mouse-1 button.  Click mouse-2 or mouse-3 to stop drawing
		  poly-lines.</p>
<p>
		* See thru for text means that text already in the buffer
		  will be visible through blanks in the text rendered, while
		  overwrite means the opposite.</p>
<p>
		* Vaporizing connected lines only vaporizes lines whose
		  _endpoints_ are connected.  See also the variable
		  `artist-vaporize-fuzziness'.</p>
<p>
		* Cut copies, then clears the rectangle/square.</p>
<p>
		* When drawing lines or poly-lines, you can set arrows.
		  See below under ``Arrows'' for more info.</p>
<p>
		* The mode line shows the currently selected drawing operation.
		  In addition, if it has an asterisk (*) at the end, you
		  are currently drawing something.</p>
<p>
		* Be patient when flood-filling -- large areas take quite
		  some time to fill.</p>
<p>

 mouse-3	Erases character under pointer
 shift mouse-3	Erases rectangle</p>
