<h3>Function: file-expand-wildcards</h3>
<p>
Expand wildcard pattern PATTERN.
This returns a list of file names which match the pattern.</p>
<p>
If PATTERN is written as an absolute file name,
the values are absolute also.</p>
<p>
If PATTERN is written as a relative file name, it is interpreted
relative to the current default directory, `default-directory'.
The file names returned are normally also relative to the current
default directory.  However, if FULL is non-nil, they are absolute.</p>
