<h3>Function: file-expand-wildcards</h3>
<p>
Expand wildcard pattern PATTERN.<br>
This returns a list of file names which match the pattern.<br>
<br>
If PATTERN is written as an absolute file name,<br>
the values are absolute also.<br>
<br>
If PATTERN is written as a relative file name, it is interpreted<br>
relative to the current default directory, `default-directory'.<br>
The file names returned are normally also relative to the current<br>
default directory.  However, if FULL is non-nil, they are absolute.</p>
