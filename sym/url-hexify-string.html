<h3>Function: url-hexify-string</h3>
<p>
URI-encode STRING and return the result.
If STRING is multibyte, it is first converted to a utf-8 byte
string.  Each byte corresponding to an allowed character is left
as-is, while all other bytes are converted to a three-character
string: "%" followed by two upper-case hex digits.</p>
<p>
The allowed characters are specified by ALLOWED-CHARS.  If this
argument is nil, the list `url-unreserved-chars' determines the
allowed characters.  Otherwise, ALLOWED-CHARS should be a vector
whose Nth element is non-nil if character N is allowed.</p>
