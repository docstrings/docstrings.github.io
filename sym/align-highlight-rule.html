<h3>Function: align-highlight-rule</h3>
<p>
Highlight the whitespace which a given rule would have modified.
BEG and END mark the extent of the region.  TITLE identifies the rule
that should be highlighted.  If RULES or EXCLUDE-RULES is set to a
list of rules (see `align-rules-list'), it can be used to override the
default alignment rules that would have been used to identify the text
to be colored.</p>
