<h3>Function: kmacro-call-macro</h3>
<p>
Call the last keyboard macro that you defined with C-x (.
A prefix argument serves as a repeat count.  Zero means repeat until error.</p>
<p>
When you call the macro, you can call the macro again by repeating
just the last key in the key sequence that you used to call this
command.  See `kmacro-call-repeat-key' and `kmacro-call-repeat-with-arg'
for details on how to adjust or disable this behavior.</p>
<p>
To make a macro permanent so you can call it even after defining
others, use M-x kmacro-name-last-macro.</p>
<p>
(fn ARG &optional NO-REPEAT END-MACRO)</p>
