<h3>Variable: gnutls-min-prime-bits</h3>
<p>
Minimum number of prime bits accepted by GnuTLS for key exchange.<br>
During a Diffie-Hellman handshake, if the server sends a prime<br>
number with fewer than this number of bits, the handshake is<br>
rejected.  (The smaller the prime number, the less secure the<br>
key exchange is against man-in-the-middle attacks.)<br>
<br>
A value of nil says to use the default GnuTLS value.</p>
