<h3>Function: completing-read-multiple</h3>
<p>
Read multiple strings in the minibuffer, with completion.
By using this functionality, a user may specify multiple strings at a
single prompt, optionally using completion.</p>
<p>
Multiple strings are specified by separating each of the strings with
a prespecified separator character.  For example, if the separator
character is a comma, the strings 'alice', 'bob', and 'eve' would be
specified as 'alice,bob,eve'.</p>
<p>
The default value for the separator character is the value of
`crm-default-separator' (comma).  The separator character may be
changed by modifying the value of `crm-separator'.</p>
<p>
Contiguous strings of non-separator-characters are referred to as
'elements'.  In the aforementioned example, the elements are: 'alice',
'bob', and 'eve'.</p>
<p>
Completion is available on a per-element basis.  For example, if the
contents of the minibuffer are 'alice,bob,eve' and point is between
'l' and 'i', pressing TAB operates on the element 'alice'.</p>
<p>
The return value of this function is a list of the read strings.</p>
