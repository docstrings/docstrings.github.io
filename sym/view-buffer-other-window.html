<h3>Function: view-buffer-other-window</h3>
<p>
View BUFFER in View mode in another window.
Emacs commands editing the buffer contents are not available;
instead, a special set of commands (mostly letters and
punctuation) are defined for moving around in the buffer.
Space scrolls forward, Delete scrolls backward.
For a list of all View commands, type H or h while viewing.</p>
<p>
This command runs the normal hook `view-mode-hook'.</p>
<p>
Optional argument NOT-RETURN is ignored.</p>
<p>
Optional argument EXIT-ACTION is either nil or a function with buffer as
argument.  This function is called when finished viewing buffer.  Use
this argument instead of explicitly setting `view-exit-action'.</p>
<p>
This function does not enable View mode if the buffer's major-mode
has a `special' mode-class, because such modes usually have their
own View-like bindings.</p>
