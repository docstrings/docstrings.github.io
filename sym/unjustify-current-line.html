<h3>Function: unjustify-current-line</h3>
<p>
Remove justification whitespace from current line.
If the line is centered or right-justified, this function removes any
indentation past the left margin.  If the line is full-justified, it removes
extra spaces between words.  It does nothing in other justification modes.</p>
