<h3>Function: re-builder</h3>
<p>
Construct a regexp interactively.
This command makes the current buffer the "target" buffer of
the regexp builder.  It displays a buffer named "*RE-Builder*"
in another window, initially containing an empty regexp.</p>
<p>
As you edit the regexp in the "*RE-Builder*" buffer, the
matching parts of the target buffer will be highlighted.</p>
