<h3>Function: re-builder</h3>
<p>
Construct a regexp interactively.<br>
This command makes the current buffer the "target" buffer of<br>
the regexp builder.  It displays a buffer named "*RE-Builder*"<br>
in another window, initially containing an empty regexp.<br>
<br>
As you edit the regexp in the "*RE-Builder*" buffer, the<br>
matching parts of the target buffer will be highlighted.
