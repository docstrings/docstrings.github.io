<h3>Function: make-overlay</h3>
<p>
Create a new overlay with range BEG to END in BUFFER.<br>
If omitted, BUFFER defaults to the current buffer.<br>
BEG and END may be integers or markers.<br>
The fourth arg FRONT-ADVANCE, if non-nil, makes the marker<br>
for the front of the overlay advance when text is inserted there<br>
(which means the text *is not* included in the overlay).<br>
The fifth arg REAR-ADVANCE, if non-nil, makes the marker<br>
for the rear of the overlay advance when text is inserted there<br>
(which means the text *is* included in the overlay).<br>
