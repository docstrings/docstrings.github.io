<h3>Variable: switch-to-visible-buffer</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, allow switching to an already visible buffer.<br>
If this variable is non-nil, `switch-to-prev-buffer' and<br>
`switch-to-next-buffer' may switch to an already visible buffer<br>
provided the buffer was shown before in the window specified as<br>
argument to those functions.  If this variable is nil,<br>
`switch-to-prev-buffer' and `switch-to-next-buffer' always try to<br>
avoid switching to a buffer that is already visible in another<br>
window on the same frame.</p>
