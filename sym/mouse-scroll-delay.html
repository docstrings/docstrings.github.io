<h3>Variable: mouse-scroll-delay</h3>
<p>
The pause between scroll steps caused by mouse drags, in seconds.<br>
If you drag the mouse beyond the edge of a window, Emacs scrolls the<br>
window to bring the text beyond that edge into view, with a delay of<br>
this many seconds between scroll steps.  Scrolling stops when you move<br>
the mouse back into the window, or release the button.<br>
This variable's value may be non-integral.<br>
Setting this to zero causes Emacs to scroll as fast as it can.</p>
