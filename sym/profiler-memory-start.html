<h3>Function: profiler-memory-start</h3>
<p>
Start/restart the memory profiler.
The memory profiler will take samples of the call-stack whenever a new
allocation takes place.  Note that most small allocations only trigger
the profiler occasionally.
See also `profiler-log-size' and `profiler-max-stack-depth'.</p>
