<h3>Function: window--resize-siblings</h3>
<p>
Resize other windows when WINDOW is resized vertically by DELTA lines.
Optional argument HORIZONTAL non-nil means resize other windows
when WINDOW is resized horizontally by DELTA columns.  WINDOW
itself is not resized by this function.</p>
<p>
Optional argument IGNORE non-nil means ignore restrictions
imposed by fixed size windows, `window-min-height' or
`window-min-width' settings.  If IGNORE equals `safe', live
windows may get as small as `window-safe-min-height' lines and
`window-safe-min-width' columns.  If IGNORE is a window, ignore
restrictions for that window only.  Any other non-nil value means
ignore all of the above restrictions for all windows.</p>
<p>
Optional arguments TRAIL and EDGE, when non-nil, refine the set
of windows that shall be resized.  If TRAIL equals `before',
resize only windows on the left or above EDGE.  If TRAIL equals
`after', resize only windows on the right or below EDGE.  Also,
preferably only resize windows adjacent to EDGE.</p>
