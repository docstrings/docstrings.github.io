<h3>Function: mapconcat</h3>
<p>
Apply FUNCTION to each element of SEQUENCE, and concat the results as strings.
In between each pair of results, stick in SEPARATOR.  Thus, " " as
SEPARATOR results in spaces between the values returned by FUNCTION.
SEQUENCE may be a list, a vector, a bool-vector, or a string.</p>
<p>
(fn FUNCTION SEQUENCE SEPARATOR)</p>
