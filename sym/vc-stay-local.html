<h3>Variable: vc-stay-local</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means use local operations when possible for remote repositories.
This avoids slow queries over the network and instead uses heuristics
and past information to determine the current status of a file.</p>
<p>
If value is the symbol `only-file' `vc-dir' will connect to the
server, but heuristics will be used to determine the status for
all other VC operations.</p>
<p>
The value can also be a regular expression or list of regular
expressions to match against the host name of a repository; then VC
only stays local for hosts that match it.  Alternatively, the value
can be a list of regular expressions where the first element is the
symbol `except'; then VC always stays local except for hosts matched
by these regular expressions.</p>
