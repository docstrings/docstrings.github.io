<h3>Variable: vc-stay-local</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means use local operations when possible for remote repositories.<br>
This avoids slow queries over the network and instead uses heuristics<br>
and past information to determine the current status of a file.<br>
<br>
If value is the symbol `only-file' `vc-dir' will connect to the<br>
server, but heuristics will be used to determine the status for<br>
all other VC operations.<br>
<br>
The value can also be a regular expression or list of regular<br>
expressions to match against the host name of a repository; then VC<br>
only stays local for hosts that match it.  Alternatively, the value<br>
can be a list of regular expressions where the first element is the<br>
symbol `except'; then VC always stays local except for hosts matched
by these regular expressions.</p>
