<h3>Variable: pcomplete-parse-arguments-function</h3>
<p>
A function to call to parse the current line's arguments.<br>
It should be called with no parameters, and with point at the position<br>
of the argument that is to be completed.<br>
<br>
It must either return nil, or a cons cell of the form:<br>
<br>
  ((ARG...) (BEG-POS...))<br>
<br>
The two lists must be identical in length.  The first gives the final<br>
value of each command line argument (which need not match the textual<br>
representation of that argument), and BEG-POS gives the beginning<br>
position of each argument, as it is seen by the user.  The establishes<br>
a relationship between the fully resolved value of the argument, and
the textual representation of the argument.</p>
