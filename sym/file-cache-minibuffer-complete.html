<h3>Function: file-cache-minibuffer-complete</h3>
<p>
Complete a filename in the minibuffer using a preloaded cache.
Filecache does two kinds of substitution: it completes on names in
the cache, and, once it has found a unique name, it cycles through
the directories that the name is available in.  With a prefix argument,
the name is considered already unique; only the second substitution
(directories) is done.</p>
