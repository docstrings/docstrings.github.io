<h3>Function: easy-menu-define-key</h3>
<p>
Add binding in MENU for KEY => ITEM.  Similar to `define-key-after'.
If KEY is not nil then delete any duplications.
If ITEM is nil, then delete the definition of KEY.</p>
<p>
Optional argument BEFORE is nil or a key in MENU.  If BEFORE is not nil,
put binding before the item in MENU named BEFORE; otherwise,
if a binding for KEY is already present in MENU, just change it;
otherwise put the new binding last in MENU.
BEFORE can be either a string (menu item name) or a symbol
(the fake function key for the menu item).
KEY does not have to be a symbol, and comparison is done with equal.</p>
