<h3>Function: make-keymap</h3>
<p>
Construct and return a new keymap, of the form (keymap CHARTABLE . ALIST).
CHARTABLE is a char-table that holds the bindings for all characters
without modifiers.  All entries in it are initially nil, meaning
"command undefined".  ALIST is an assoc-list which holds bindings for
function keys, mouse events, and any other things that appear in the
input stream.  Initially, ALIST is nil.</p>
<p>
The optional arg STRING supplies a menu name for the keymap
in case you use it as a menu with `x-popup-menu'.</p>
