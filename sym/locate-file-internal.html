<h3>Function: locate-file-internal</h3>
<p>
Search for FILENAME through PATH.<br>
Returns the file's name in absolute form, or nil if not found.<br>
If SUFFIXES is non-nil, it should be a list of suffixes to append to<br>
file name when searching.<br>
If non-nil, PREDICATE is used instead of `file-readable-p'.<br>
PREDICATE can also be an integer to pass to the access(2) function,<br>
in which case file-name-handlers are ignored.<br>
This function will normally skip directories, so if you want it to find<br>
directories, make sure the PREDICATE function returns `dir-ok' for them.<br>
<br>
(fn FILENAME PATH &optional SUFFIXES PREDICATE)</p>
