<h3>Variable: ignore-window-parameters</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, standard functions ignore window parameters.<br>
The functions currently affected by this are `split-window',<br>
`delete-window', `delete-other-windows' and `other-window'.<br>
<br>
An application may bind this to a non-nil value around calls to<br>
these functions to inhibit processing of window parameters.</p>
