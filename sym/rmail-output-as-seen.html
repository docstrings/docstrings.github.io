<h3>Function: rmail-output-as-seen</h3>
<p>
Append this message to mbox file named FILE-NAME.<br>
The details are as for `rmail-output', except that:<br>
  i) the header is output as currently seen<br>
 ii) this function cannot write to Babyl files<br>
iii) an Rmail buffer cannot be visiting FILE-NAME<br>
<br>
Note that if NOT-RMAIL is non-nil, there is no difference between this<br>
function and `rmail-output'.  This argument may be removed in future,<br>
so you should call `rmail-output' directly in that case.<br>
<br>
(fn FILE-NAME &optional COUNT NOATTRIBUTE NOT-RMAIL)</p>
