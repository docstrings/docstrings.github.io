<h3>Function: rmail-output-as-seen</h3>
<p>
Append this message to mbox file named FILE-NAME.
The details are as for `rmail-output', except that:
  i) the header is output as currently seen
 ii) this function cannot write to Babyl files
iii) an Rmail buffer cannot be visiting FILE-NAME</p>
<p>
Note that if NOT-RMAIL is non-nil, there is no difference between this
function and `rmail-output'.  This argument may be removed in future,
so you should call `rmail-output' directly in that case.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE-NAME &optional COUNT NOATTRIBUTE NOT-RMAIL)</p>
