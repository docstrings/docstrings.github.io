<h3>Function: substring</h3>
<p>
Return a new string whose contents are a substring of STRING.<br>
The returned string consists of the characters between index FROM<br>
(inclusive) and index TO (exclusive) of STRING.  FROM and TO are<br>
zero-indexed: 0 means the first character of STRING.  Negative values<br>
are counted from the end of STRING.  If TO is nil, the substring runs<br>
to the end of STRING.<br>
<br>
The STRING argument may also be a vector.  In that case, the return<br>
value is a new vector that contains the elements between index FROM<br>
(inclusive) and index TO (exclusive) of that vector argument.
