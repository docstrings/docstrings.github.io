<h3>Function: substring</h3>
<p>
Return a new string whose contents are a substring of STRING.
The returned string consists of the characters between index FROM
(inclusive) and index TO (exclusive) of STRING.  FROM and TO are
zero-indexed: 0 means the first character of STRING.  Negative values
are counted from the end of STRING.  If TO is nil, the substring runs
to the end of STRING.</p>
<p>
The STRING argument may also be a vector.  In that case, the return
value is a new vector that contains the elements between index FROM
(inclusive) and index TO (exclusive) of that vector argument.</p>

(fn STRING FROM &optional TO)</p>
