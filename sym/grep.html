<h3>Function: grep</h3>
<p>
Run grep, with user-specified args, and collect output in a buffer.
While grep runs asynchronously, you can use C-x ` (M-x next-error),
or 
Uses keymap `grep-mode-map', which is not currently defined.
M-x compile-goto-error in the *grep* buffer, to go to the lines where grep found
matches.  To kill the grep job before it finishes, type M-x kill-compilation.</p>
<p>
For doing a recursive `grep', see the `rgrep' command.  For running
`grep' in a specific directory, see `lgrep'.</p>

This command uses a special history list for its COMMAND-ARGS, so you
can easily repeat a grep command.</p>

tag the cursor is over, substituting it into the last grep command
in the grep command history (or into `grep-command' if that history
list is empty).</p>
