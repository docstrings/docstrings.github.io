<h3>Function: grep</h3>
<p>
Run grep, with user-specified args, and collect output in a buffer.<br>
While grep runs asynchronously, you can use C-x ` (M-x next-error),<br>
or <br>
Uses keymap `grep-mode-map', which is not currently defined.<br>
M-x compile-goto-error in the *grep* buffer, to go to the lines where grep found<br>
matches.  To kill the grep job before it finishes, type M-x kill-compilation.<br>
<br>
For doing a recursive `grep', see the `rgrep' command.  For running<br>
`grep' in a specific directory, see `lgrep'.<br>
<br>
This command uses a special history list for its COMMAND-ARGS, so you<br>
can easily repeat a grep command.<br>
<br>
A prefix argument says to default the argument based upon the current<br>
tag the cursor is over, substituting it into the last grep command<br>
in the grep command history (or into `grep-command' if that history
list is empty).
