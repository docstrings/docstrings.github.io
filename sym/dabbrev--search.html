<h3>Function: dabbrev--search</h3>
<p>

Second arg, REVERSE, is t for reverse search, nil for forward.
The variable `dabbrev-limit' controls the maximum search region size.
Third argument IGNORE-CASE non-nil means treat case as insignificant while
looking for a match and when comparing with previous matches.  Also if
that's non-nil and the match is found at the beginning of a sentence
and is in lower case except for the initial then it is converted to
all lower case for return.</p>

`dabbrev--last-table' so that only distinct possibilities are found
by dabbrev-re-expand.</p>
