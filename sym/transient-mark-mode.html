<h3>Function: transient-mark-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle Transient Mark mode.<br>
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Transient Mark mode if ARG is<br>
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable<br>
Transient Mark mode if ARG is omitted or nil.<br>
<br>
Transient Mark mode is a global minor mode.  When enabled, the<br>
region is highlighted whenever the mark is active.  The mark is<br>
"deactivated" by changing the buffer, and after certain other<br>
operations that set the mark but whose main purpose is something<br>
else--for example, incremental search, M-<, and M->.<br>
<br>
You can also deactivate the mark by typing C-g or<br>
M-ESC ESC.<br>
<br>
Many commands change their behavior when Transient Mark mode is<br>
in effect and the mark is active, by acting on the region instead<br>
of their usual default part of the buffer's text.  Examples of<br>
such commands include M-;, M-x flush-lines, M-x keep-lines,<br>
M-%, C-M-%, M-x ispell, and C-x u.<br>
To see the documentation of commands which are sensitive to the<br>
Transient Mark mode, invoke C-h d and type "transient"
or "mark.*active" at the prompt.</p>
<h3>Variable: transient-mark-mode</h3>
<p>
Non-nil if Transient Mark mode is enabled.<br>
See the command `transient-mark-mode' for a description of this minor mode.<br>
<br>
Non-nil also enables highlighting of the region whenever the mark is active.<br>
The variable `highlight-nonselected-windows' controls whether to highlight<br>
all windows or just the selected window.<br>
<br>
Lisp programs may give this variable certain special values:<br>
<br>
- A value of `lambda' enables Transient Mark mode temporarily.<br>
  It is disabled again after any subsequent action that would<br>
  normally deactivate the mark (e.g. buffer modification).<br>
<br>
- A value of (only . OLDVAL) enables Transient Mark mode<br>
  temporarily.  After any subsequent point motion command that is<br>
  not shift-translated, or any other action that would normally<br>
  deactivate the mark (e.g. buffer modification), the value of
  `transient-mark-mode' is set to OLDVAL.</p>
