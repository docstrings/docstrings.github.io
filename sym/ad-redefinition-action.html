<h3>Variable: ad-redefinition-action</h3>
<p>
Defines what to do with redefinitions during Advice de/activation.<br>
Redefinition occurs if a previously activated function that already has an<br>
original definition associated with it gets redefined and then de/activated.<br>
In such a case we can either accept the current definition as the new<br>
original definition, discard the current definition and replace it with the<br>
old original, or keep it and raise an error.  The values `accept', `discard',<br>
`error' or `warn' govern what will be done.  `warn' is just like `accept' but<br>
it additionally prints a warning message.  All other values will be
interpreted as `error'.</p>
