<h3>Variable: mouse-wheel-click-event</h3>
<p>
Event that should be temporarily inhibited after mouse scrolling.<br>
The mouse wheel is typically on the mouse-2 button, so it may easily<br>
happen that text is accidentally yanked into the buffer when<br>
scrolling with the mouse wheel.  To prevent that, this variable can be<br>
set to the event sent when clicking on the mouse wheel button.</p>
