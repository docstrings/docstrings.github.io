<h3>Function: display-time-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle display of time, load level, and mail flag in mode lines.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Display Time mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
it if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When Display Time mode is enabled, it updates every minute (you
can control the number of seconds between updates by customizing
`display-time-interval').  If `display-time-day-and-date' is
non-nil, the current day and date are displayed as well.  This
runs the normal hook `display-time-hook' after each update.</p>
<h3>Variable: display-time-mode</h3>
<p>
Non-nil if Display-Time mode is enabled.
See the command `display-time-mode' for a description of this minor mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')
or call the function `display-time-mode'.</p>
