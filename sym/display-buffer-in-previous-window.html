<h3>Function: display-buffer-in-previous-window</h3>
<p>
Display BUFFER in a window previously showing it.
If ALIST has a non-nil `inhibit-same-window' entry, the selected
window is not eligible for reuse.</p>
<p>
If ALIST contains a `reusable-frames' entry, its value determines
which frames to search for a reusable window:
  nil -- the selected frame (actually the last non-minibuffer frame)
  A frame   -- just that frame
  `visible' -- all visible frames
  0   -- all frames on the current terminal
  t   -- all frames.</p>
<p>
If ALIST contains no `reusable-frames' entry, search just the
selected frame if `display-buffer-reuse-frames' and
`pop-up-frames' are both nil; search all frames on the current
terminal if either of those variables is non-nil.</p>
<p>
If ALIST has a `previous-window' entry, the window specified by
that entry will override any other window found by the methods
above, even if that window never showed BUFFER before.</p>
