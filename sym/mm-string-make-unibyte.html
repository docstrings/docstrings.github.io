<h3>Function: mm-string-make-unibyte</h3>
<p>
Return the unibyte equivalent of STRING.
Multibyte character codes are converted to unibyte according to
`nonascii-translation-table' or, if that is nil, `nonascii-insert-offset'.
If the lookup in the translation table fails, this function takes just
the low 8 bits of each character.</p>
