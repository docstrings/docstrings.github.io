<h3>Function: facemenu-set-background</h3>
<p>
Set the background COLOR of the region or next character typed.<br>
This command reads the color in the minibuffer.<br>
<br>
If the region is active (normally true except in Transient Mark mode)<br>
and there is no prefix argument, this command sets the region to the<br>
requested face.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, this command specifies the face for the next character<br>
inserted.  Moving point or switching buffers before<br>
typing a character to insert cancels the specification.</p>
