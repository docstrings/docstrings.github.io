<h3>Function: org-mode</h3>
<p>
Outline-based notes management and organizer, alias<br>
"Carsten's outline-mode for keeping track of everything."<br>
<br>
Org-mode develops organizational tasks around a NOTES file which<br>
contains information about projects as plain text.  Org-mode is<br>
implemented on top of outline-mode, which is ideal to keep the content<br>
of large files well structured.  It supports ToDo items, deadlines and<br>
time stamps, which magically appear in the diary listing of the Emacs<br>
calendar.  Tables are easily created with a built-in table editor.<br>
Plain text URL-like links connect to websites, emails (VM), Usenet<br>
messages (Gnus), BBDB entries, and any files related to the project.<br>
For printing and sharing of notes, an Org-mode file (or a part of it)<br>
can be exported as a structured ASCII or HTML file.<br>
<br>
The following commands are available:<br>
