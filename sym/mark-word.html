<h3>Function: mark-word</h3>
<p>
Set mark ARG words away from point.
The place mark goes is the same place M-f would
move to with the same argument.
Interactively, if this command is repeated
or (in Transient Mark mode) if the mark is active,
it marks the next ARG words after the ones already marked.</p>
