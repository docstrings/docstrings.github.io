<h3>Function: make-directory</h3>
<p>
Create the directory DIR and optionally any nonexistent parent dirs.
If DIR already exists as a directory, signal an error, unless
PARENTS is non-nil.</p>
<p>
Interactively, the default choice of directory to create is the
current buffer's default directory.  That is useful when you have
visited a file in a nonexistent directory.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, the second (optional) argument PARENTS, if
non-nil, says whether to create parent directories that don't
exist.  Interactively, this happens by default.</p>
<p>
If creating the directory or directories fail, an error will be
raised.</p>
