<h3>Variable: word-wrap</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means to use word-wrapping for continuation lines.
When word-wrapping is on, continuation lines are wrapped at the space
or tab character nearest to the right window edge.
If nil, continuation lines are wrapped at the right screen edge.</p>
<p>
This variable has no effect if long lines are truncated (see
`truncate-lines' and `truncate-partial-width-windows').  If you use
word-wrapping, you might want to reduce the value of
`truncate-partial-width-windows', since wrapping can make text readable
in narrower windows.</p>
<p>
Instead of setting this variable directly, most users should use
Visual Line mode .  Visual Line mode, when enabled, sets `word-wrap'
to t, and additionally redefines simple editing commands to act on
visual lines rather than logical lines.  See the documentation of
`visual-line-mode'.</p>
