<h3>Function: visited-file-modtime</h3>
<p>
Return the current buffer's recorded visited file modification time.
The value is a list of the form (HIGH LOW USEC PSEC), like the time values that
`file-attributes' returns.  If the current buffer has no recorded file
modification time, this function returns 0.  If the visited file
doesn't exist, HIGH will be -1.
See Info node `(elisp)Modification Time' for more details.</p>
