<h3>Variable: frame-background-mode</h3>
<p>
The brightness of the background.
Set this to the symbol `dark' if your background color is dark,
`light' if your background is light, or nil (automatic by default)
if you want Emacs to examine the brightness for you.  Don't set this
variable with `setq'; this won't have the expected effect.</p>
