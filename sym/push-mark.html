<h3>Function: push-mark</h3>
<p>
Set mark at LOCATION (point, by default) and push old mark on mark ring.<br>
If the last global mark pushed was not in the current buffer,<br>
also push LOCATION on the global mark ring.<br>

<br>
Novice Emacs Lisp programmers often try to use the mark for the wrong<br>
purposes.  See the documentation of `set-mark' for more information.<br>
<br>
