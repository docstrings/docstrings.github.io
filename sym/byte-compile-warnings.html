<h3>Variable: byte-compile-warnings</h3>
<p>
List of warnings that the byte-compiler should issue (t for all).</p>
<p>
Elements of the list may be:</p>
<p>
  free-vars   references to variables not in the current lexical scope.
  unresolved  calls to unknown functions.
  callargs    function calls with args that don't match the definition.
  redefine    function name redefined from a macro to ordinary function or vice
              versa, or redefined to take a different number of arguments.
  obsolete    obsolete variables and functions.
  noruntime   functions that may not be defined at runtime (typically
              defined only under `eval-when-compile').
  cl-functions    calls to runtime functions from the CL package (as
		  distinguished from macros and aliases).
  interactive-only
	      commands that normally shouldn't be called from Lisp code.
  make-local  calls to make-variable-buffer-local that may be incorrect.
  mapcar      mapcar called for effect.
  constants   let-binding of, or assignment to, constants/nonvariables.
  suspicious  constructs that usually don't do what the coder wanted.</p>
<p>
If the list begins with `not', then the remaining elements specify warnings to
suppress.  For example, (not mapcar) will suppress warnings about mapcar.</p>
