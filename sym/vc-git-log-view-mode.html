<h3>Function: vc-git-log-view-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode derived from `log-view-mode' by `define-derived-mode'.
It inherits all of the parent's attributes, but has its own keymap,
abbrev table and syntax table:</p>
<p>
  `vc-git-log-view-mode-map', `vc-git-log-view-mode-abbrev-table' and `vc-git-log-view-mode-syntax-table'</p>
<p>
which more-or-less shadow log-view-mode's corresponding tables.</p>
<p>
In addition to any hooks its parent mode might have run,
this mode runs the hook `vc-git-log-view-mode-hook', as the final step
during initialization.</p>
