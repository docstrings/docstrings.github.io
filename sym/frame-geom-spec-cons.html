<h3>Function: frame-geom-spec-cons</h3>
<p>
Return equivalent geometry spec for FRAME as a cons with car `+'.
A geometry specification equivalent to SPEC for FRAME is returned,
where the value is a cons with car `+', not numeric.
SPEC is a frame geometry spec: (left . VALUE) or (top . VALUE).
If VALUE is a number, then it is converted to a cons value, perhaps
   relative to the opposite frame edge from that in the original spec.
FRAME defaults to the selected frame.</p>

Examples (measures in pixels) -
 Assuming display height=1024, frame height=600:
 top 300 below display top:               (top .  300) => (top +  300)
                                          (top +  300) => (top +  300)
 bottom 300 above display bottom:         (top -  300) => (top +  124)
                                          (top . -300) => (top +  124)
 top 300 above display top
  (= bottom 724 above display bottom):    (top + -300) => (top + -300)
 bottom 300 below display bottom
  (= top 724 below display top):          (top - -300) => (top +  724)</p>
<p>
In the 3rd, 4th, and 6th examples, the returned value is relative to
the opposite frame edge from the edge indicated in the input spec.</p>
