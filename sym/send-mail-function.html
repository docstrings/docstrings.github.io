<h3>Variable: send-mail-function</h3>
<p>
Function to call to send the current buffer as mail.
The headers should be delimited by a line which is
not a valid RFC822 header or continuation line,
that matches the variable `mail-header-separator'.
This is used by the default mail-sending commands.  See also
`message-send-mail-function' for use with the Message package.</p>
