<h3>Function: display-warning</h3>
<p>
Display a warning message, MESSAGE.
TYPE is the warning type: either a custom group name (a symbol),
or a list of symbols whose first element is a custom group name.
(The rest of the symbols represent subcategories, for warning purposes
only, and you can use whatever symbols you like.)</p>
<p>
LEVEL should be either :debug, :warning, :error, or :emergency
(but see `warning-minimum-level' and `warning-minimum-log-level').
Default is :warning.</p>
<p>
:emergency -- a problem that will seriously impair Emacs operation soon
	      if you do not attend to it promptly.
:error     -- data or circumstances that are inherently wrong.
:warning   -- data or circumstances that are not inherently wrong,
	      but raise suspicion of a possible problem.
:debug     -- info for debugging only.</p>
<p>
BUFFER-NAME, if specified, is the name of the buffer for logging
the warning.  By default, it is `*Warnings*'.  If this function
has to create the buffer, it disables undo in the buffer.</p>
<p>
See the `warnings' custom group for user customization features.</p>
<p>
See also `warning-series', `warning-prefix-function' and
`warning-fill-prefix' for additional programming features.</p>
