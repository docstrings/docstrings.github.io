<h3>Function: locate-dominating-file</h3>
<p>
Look up the directory hierarchy from FILE for a directory containing NAME.
Stop at the first parent directory containing a file NAME,
and return the directory.  Return nil if not found.
Instead of a string, NAME can also be a predicate taking one argument
(a directory) and returning a non-nil value if that directory is the one for
which we're looking.</p>
