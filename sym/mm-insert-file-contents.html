<h3>Function: mm-insert-file-contents</h3>
<p>
Like `insert-file-contents', but only reads in the file.<br>
A buffer may be modified in several ways after reading into the buffer due<br>
to advanced Emacs features, such as file-name-handlers, format decoding,<br>
`find-file-hooks', etc.<br>
If INHIBIT is non-nil, inhibit `mm-inhibit-file-name-handlers'.<br>
  This function ensures that none of these modifications will take place.</p>
