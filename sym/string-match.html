<h3>Function: string-match</h3>
<p>
Return index of start of first match for REGEXP in STRING, or nil.<br>
Matching ignores case if `case-fold-search' is non-nil.<br>
If third arg START is non-nil, start search at that index in STRING.<br>
For index of first char beyond the match, do (match-end 0).<br>
`match-end' and `match-beginning' also give indices of substrings<br>
matched by parenthesis constructs in the pattern.<br>
<br>
You can use the function `match-string' to extract the substrings<br>
matched by the parenthesis constructions in REGEXP.<br>

(fn REGEXP STRING &optional START)</p>
