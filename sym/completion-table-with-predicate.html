<h3>Function: completion-table-with-predicate</h3>
<p>
Make a completion table equivalent to TABLE but filtered through PRED1.
PRED1 is a function of one argument which returns non-nil if and only if the
argument is an element of TABLE which should be considered for completion.
STRING, PRED2, and ACTION are the usual arguments to completion tables,
as described in `try-completion', `all-completions', and `test-completion'.
If STRICT is t, the predicate always applies; if nil it only applies if
it does not reduce the set of possible completions to nothing.
Note: TABLE needs to be a proper completion table which obeys predicates.</p>
