<h3>Function: frexp</h3>
<p>
Get significand and exponent of a floating point number.
Breaks the floating point number X into its binary significand SGNFCAND
(a floating point value between 0.5 (included) and 1.0 (excluded))
and an integral exponent EXP for 2, such that:</p>
<p>
  X = SGNFCAND * 2^EXP</p>
<p>
The function returns the cons cell (SGNFCAND . EXP).
If X is zero, both parts (SGNFCAND and EXP) are zero.</p>
<p>
(fn X)</p>
