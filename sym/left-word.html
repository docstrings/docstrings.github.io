<h3>Function: left-word</h3>
<p>
Move point N words to the left (to the right if N is negative).<br>
<br>
Depending on the bidirectional context, this may move either backward<br>
or forward in the buffer.  This is in contrast with M-b<br>
and M-f, which see.<br>
<br>
Value is normally t.<br>
If an edge of the buffer or a field boundary is reached, point is left there<br>
there and the function returns nil.  Field boundaries are not noticed<br>
if `inhibit-field-text-motion' is non-nil.</p>
