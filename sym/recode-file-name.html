<h3>Function: recode-file-name</h3>
<p>
Change the encoding of FILE's name from CODING to NEW-CODING.
The value is a new name of FILE.
Signals a `file-already-exists' error if a file of the new name
already exists unless optional fourth argument OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS
is non-nil.  A number as fourth arg means request confirmation if
the new name already exists.  This is what happens in interactive
use with M-x.</p>
