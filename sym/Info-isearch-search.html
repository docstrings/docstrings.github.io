<h3>Variable: Info-isearch-search</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, isearch in Info searches through multiple nodes.
Before leaving the initial Info node, where isearch was started,
it fails once with the error message [end of node], and with
subsequent C-s/C-r continues through other nodes without failing
with this error message in other nodes.  When isearch fails for
the rest of the manual, it displays the error message [end of manual],
wraps around the whole manual and restarts the search from the top/final
node depending on search direction.</p>
<p>
Setting this option to nil restores the default isearch behavior
with wrapping around the current Info node.</p>
