<h3>Function: comint-exec</h3>
<p>
Start up a process named NAME in buffer BUFFER for Comint modes.
Runs the given COMMAND with SWITCHES, and initial input from STARTFILE.</p>
<p>
COMMAND should be one of the following:
- a string, denoting an executable program to create via
  `start-file-process'
- a cons pair of the form (HOST . SERVICE), denoting a TCP
  connection to be opened via `open-network-stream'
- nil, denoting a newly-allocated pty.</p>
<p>
This function blasts any old process running in the buffer, and
does not set the buffer mode.  You can use this to cheaply run a
series of processes in the same Comint buffer.  The hook
`comint-exec-hook' is run after each exec.</p>
