<h3>Function: 2C-split</h3>
<p>
Split a two-column text at point, into two buffers in two-column minor mode.
Point becomes the local value of `2C-window-width'.  Only lines that
have the ARG same preceding characters at that column get split.  The
ARG preceding characters without any leading whitespace become the local
value for `2C-separator'.  This way lines that continue across both
columns remain untouched in the first buffer.</p>
<p>
This function can be used with a prototype line, to set up things.  You
write the first line of each column and then split that line.  E.g.:</p>
<p>
First column's text    sSs  Second column's text
		       \___/\
			/    \
   5 character Separator      You type  M-5 M-x 2C-split  with the point here.</p>
