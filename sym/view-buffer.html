<h3>Function: view-buffer</h3>
<p>
View BUFFER in View mode, returning to previous buffer when done.
Emacs commands editing the buffer contents are not available; instead, a
special set of commands (mostly letters and punctuation) are defined for
moving around in the buffer.
Space scrolls forward, Delete scrolls backward.
For a list of all View commands, type H or h while viewing.</p>
<p>
This command runs the normal hook `view-mode-hook'.</p>
<p>
Optional argument EXIT-ACTION is either nil or a function with buffer as
argument.  This function is called when finished viewing buffer.  Use
this argument instead of explicitly setting `view-exit-action'.</p>
<p>
Do not set EXIT-ACTION to `kill-buffer' when BUFFER visits a
file: Users may suspend viewing in order to modify the buffer.
Exiting View mode will then discard the user's edits.  Setting
EXIT-ACTION to `kill-buffer-if-not-modified' avoids this.</p>
<p>
This function does not enable View mode if the buffer's major-mode
has a `special' mode-class, because such modes usually have their
own View-like bindings.</p>
