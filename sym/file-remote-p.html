<h3>Function: file-remote-p</h3>
<p>
Test whether FILE specifies a location on a remote system.
A file is considered remote if accessing it is likely to
be slower or less reliable than accessing local files.</p>
<p>
`file-remote-p' never opens a new remote connection.  It can
only reuse a connection that is already open.</p>
<p>
Return nil or a string identifying the remote connection
(ideally a prefix of FILE).  Return nil if FILE is a relative
file name.</p>
<p>
When IDENTIFICATION is nil, the returned string is a complete
remote identifier: with components method, user, and host.  The
components are those present in FILE, with defaults filled in for
any that are missing.</p>
<p>
IDENTIFICATION can specify which part of the identification to
return.  IDENTIFICATION can be the symbol `method', `user',
`host', or `localname'.  Any other value is handled like nil and
means to return the complete identification.  The string returned
for IDENTIFICATION `localname' can differ depending on whether
there is an existing connection.</p>
<p>
If CONNECTED is non-nil, return an identification only if FILE is
located on a remote system and a connection is established to
that remote system.</p>
<p>
Tip: You can use this expansion of remote identifier components
     to derive a new remote file name from an existing one.  For
     example, if FILE is "/sudo::/path/to/file" then</p>
<p>
       (concat (file-remote-p FILE) "/bin/sh")</p>
<p>
     returns a remote file name for file "/bin/sh" that has the
     same remote identifier as FILE but expanded; a name such as
     "/sudo:root@myhost:/bin/sh".</p>
