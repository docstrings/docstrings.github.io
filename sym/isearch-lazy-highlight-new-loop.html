<h3>Function: isearch-lazy-highlight-new-loop</h3>
<p>
Cleanup any previous `lazy-highlight' loop and begin a new one.<br>
BEG and END specify the bounds within which highlighting should occur.<br>
This is called when `isearch-update' is invoked (which can cause the<br>
search string to change or the window to scroll).  It is also used<br>
by other Emacs features.</p>
