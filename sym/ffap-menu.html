<h3>Function: ffap-menu</h3>
<p>
Put up a menu of files and URLs mentioned in this buffer.
Then set mark, jump to choice, and try to fetch it.  The menu is
cached in `ffap-menu-alist', and rebuilt by `ffap-menu-rescan'.
The optional RESCAN argument (a prefix, interactively) forces
a rebuild.  Searches with `ffap-menu-regexp'.</p>
