<h3>Variable: selective-display</h3>
<p>
Non-nil enables selective display.<br>
An integer N as value means display only lines<br>
that start with less than N columns of space.<br>
A value of t means that the character ^M makes itself and<br>
all the rest of the line invisible; also, when saving the buffer<br>
in a file, save the ^M as a newline.</p>
