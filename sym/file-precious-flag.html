<h3>Variable: file-precious-flag</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means protect against I/O errors while saving files.
Some modes set this non-nil in particular buffers.</p>
<p>
This feature works by writing the new contents into a temporary file
and then renaming the temporary file to replace the original.
In this way, any I/O error in writing leaves the original untouched,
and there is never any instant where the file is nonexistent.</p>
<p>
Note that this feature forces backups to be made by copying.
Yet, at the same time, saving a precious file
breaks any hard links between it and other files.</p>
<p>
This feature is advisory: for example, if the directory in which the
file is being saved is not writable, Emacs may ignore a non-nil value
of `file-precious-flag' and write directly into the file.</p>
