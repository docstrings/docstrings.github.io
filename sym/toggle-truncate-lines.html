<h3>Function: toggle-truncate-lines</h3>
<p>
Toggle truncating of long lines for the current buffer.
When truncating is off, long lines are folded.
With prefix argument ARG, truncate long lines if ARG is positive,
otherwise fold them.  Note that in side-by-side windows, this
command has no effect if `truncate-partial-width-windows' is
non-nil.</p>
