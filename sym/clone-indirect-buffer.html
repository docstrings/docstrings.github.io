<h3>Function: clone-indirect-buffer</h3>
<p>
Create an indirect buffer that is a twin copy of the current buffer.</p>
<p>
Give the indirect buffer name NEWNAME.  Interactively, read NEWNAME
from the minibuffer when invoked with a prefix arg.  If NEWNAME is nil
or if not called with a prefix arg, NEWNAME defaults to the current
buffer's name.  The name is modified by adding a `<N>' suffix to it
or by incrementing the N in an existing suffix.  Trying to clone a
buffer whose major mode symbol has a non-nil `no-clone-indirect'
property results in an error.</p>
<p>
DISPLAY-FLAG non-nil means show the new buffer with `pop-to-buffer'.
This is always done when called interactively.</p>
<p>
Optional third arg NORECORD non-nil means do not put this buffer at the
front of the list of recently selected ones.</p>
