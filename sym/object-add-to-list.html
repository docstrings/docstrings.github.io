<h3>Function: object-add-to-list</h3>
<p>
In OBJECT's SLOT, add ITEM to the list of elements.<br>
Optional argument APPEND indicates we need to append to the list.<br>
If ITEM already exists in the list in SLOT, then it is not added.<br>
Comparison is done with `equal' through the `member' function call.<br>
If SLOT is unbound, bind it to the list containing ITEM.</p>
