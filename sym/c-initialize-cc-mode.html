<h3>Function: c-initialize-cc-mode</h3>
<p>
Initialize CC Mode for use in the current buffer.
If the optional NEW-STYLE-INIT is nil or left out then all necessary
initialization to run CC Mode for the C language is done.  Otherwise
only some basic setup is done, and a call to `c-init-language-vars' or
`c-init-language-vars-for' is necessary too (which gives more
control).  See "cc-mode.el" for more info.</p>
