<h3>Variable: trash-directory</h3>
<p>
Directory for `move-file-to-trash' to move files and directories to.
This directory is only used when the function `system-move-file-to-trash'
is not defined.
Relative paths are interpreted relative to `default-directory'.
If the value is nil, Emacs uses a freedesktop.org-style trashcan.</p>
