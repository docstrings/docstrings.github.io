<h3>Function: get-mru-window</h3>
<p>
Return the most recently used window on frames specified by ALL-FRAMES.
A minibuffer window is never a candidate.  A dedicated window is
never a candidate unless DEDICATED is non-nil, so if all windows
are dedicated, the value is nil.  Optional argument NOT-SELECTED
non-nil means never return the selected window.</p>
<p>
The following non-nil values of the optional argument ALL-FRAMES
have special meanings:</p>
<p>
- t means consider all windows on all existing frames.</p>
<p>
- `visible' means consider all windows on all visible frames on
  the current terminal.</p>
<p>
- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible
  and iconified frames on the current terminal.</p>
<p>
- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.</p>
<p>
Any other value of ALL-FRAMES means consider all windows on the
selected frame and no others.</p>
