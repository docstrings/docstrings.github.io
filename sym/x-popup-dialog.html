<h3>Function: x-popup-dialog</h3>
<p>
Pop up a dialog box and return user's selection.
POSITION specifies which frame to use.
This is normally a mouse button event or a window or frame.
If POSITION is t, it means to use the frame the mouse is on.
The dialog box appears in the middle of the specified frame.</p>
<p>
CONTENTS specifies the alternatives to display in the dialog box.
It is a list of the form (DIALOG ITEM1 ITEM2...).
Each ITEM is a cons cell (STRING . VALUE).
The return value is VALUE from the chosen item.</p>
<p>
An ITEM may also be just a string--that makes a nonselectable item.
An ITEM may also be nil--that means to put all preceding items
on the left of the dialog box and all following items on the right.
(By default, approximately half appear on each side.)</p>
<p>
If HEADER is non-nil, the frame title for the box is "Information",
otherwise it is "Question".</p>
<p>
If the user gets rid of the dialog box without making a valid choice,
for instance using the window manager, then this produces a quit and
`x-popup-dialog' does not return.</p>
