<h3>Function: sh-make-vars-local</h3>
<p>
Make the indentation variables local to this buffer.<br>
Normally they already are local.  This command is provided in case<br>
variable `sh-make-vars-local' has been set to nil.<br>
<br>
To revert all these variables to the global values, use<br>
command `sh-reset-indent-vars-to-global-values'.</p>
<h3>Variable: sh-make-vars-local</h3>
<p>
Controls whether indentation variables are local to the buffer.<br>
If non-nil, indentation variables are made local initially.<br>
If nil, you can later make the variables local by invoking<br>
command `sh-make-vars-local'.<br>
The default is t because I assume that in one Emacs session one is<br>
frequently editing existing scripts with different styles.</p>
