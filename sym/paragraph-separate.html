<h3>Variable: paragraph-separate</h3>
<p>
Regexp for beginning of a line that separates paragraphs.
If you change this, you may have to change `paragraph-start' also.</p>
<p>
This is matched against the text at the left margin, which is not necessarily
the beginning of the line, so it should not use "^" as an anchor.  This
ensures that the paragraph functions will work equally within a region of
text indented by a margin setting.</p>
