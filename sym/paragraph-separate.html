<h3>Variable: paragraph-separate</h3>
<p>
Regexp for beginning of a line that separates paragraphs.<br>
If you change this, you may have to change `paragraph-start' also.<br>
<br>
This is matched against the text at the left margin, which is not necessarily<br>
the beginning of the line, so it should not use "^" as an anchor.  This<br>
ensures that the paragraph functions will work equally within a region of<br>
text indented by a margin setting.</p>
