<h3>Function: scroll-lock-mode</h3>
<p>
Buffer-local minor mode for pager-like scrolling.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable the mode if ARG is positive,
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode
if ARG is omitted or nil.  When enabled, keys that normally move
point by line or paragraph will scroll the buffer by the
respective amount of lines instead and point will be kept
vertically fixed relative to window boundaries during scrolling.</p>
