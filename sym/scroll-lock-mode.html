<h3>Function: scroll-lock-mode</h3>
<p>
Buffer-local minor mode for pager-like scrolling.<br>
With a prefix argument ARG, enable the mode if ARG is positive,<br>
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode<br>
if ARG is omitted or nil.  When enabled, keys that normally move<br>
point by line or paragraph will scroll the buffer by the<br>
respective amount of lines instead and point will be kept<br>
vertically fixed relative to window boundaries during scrolling.
