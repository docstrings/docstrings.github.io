<h3>Function: save-buffer</h3>
<p>
Save current buffer in visited file if modified.
Variations are described below.</p>
<p>
By default, makes the previous version into a backup file
 if previously requested or if this is the first save.
Prefixed with one C-u, marks this version
 to become a backup when the next save is done.
Prefixed with two C-u's,
 unconditionally makes the previous version into a backup file.
Prefixed with three C-u's, marks this version
 to become a backup when the next save is done,
 and unconditionally makes the previous version into a backup file.</p>
<p>
With a numeric argument of 0, never make the previous version
into a backup file.</p>
<p>
If a file's name is FOO, the names of its numbered backup versions are
 FOO.~i~ for various integers i.  A non-numbered backup file is called FOO~.
Numeric backups (rather than FOO~) will be made if value of
 `version-control' is not the atom `never' and either there are already
 numeric versions of the file being backed up, or `version-control' is
 non-nil.
We don't want excessive versions piling up, so there are variables
 `kept-old-versions', which tells Emacs how many oldest versions to keep,
 and `kept-new-versions', which tells how many newest versions to keep.
 Defaults are 2 old versions and 2 new.
`dired-kept-versions' controls dired's clean-directory (.) command.
If `delete-old-versions' is nil, system will query user
 before trimming versions.  Otherwise it does it silently.</p>
<p>
If `vc-make-backup-files' is nil, which is the default,
 no backup files are made for files managed by version control.
 (This is because the version control system itself records previous versions.)</p>
