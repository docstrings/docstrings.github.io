<h3>Function: suspend-emacs</h3>
<p>
Stop Emacs and return to superior process.  You can resume later.
If `cannot-suspend' is non-nil, or if the system doesn't support job
control, run a subshell instead.</p>
<p>
If optional arg STUFFSTRING is non-nil, its characters are stuffed
to be read as terminal input by Emacs's parent, after suspension.</p>
<p>
Before suspending, run the normal hook `suspend-hook'.
After resumption run the normal hook `suspend-resume-hook'.</p>
<p>
Some operating systems cannot stop the Emacs process and resume it later.
On such systems, Emacs starts a subshell instead of suspending.</p>
