<h3>Function: suspend-emacs</h3>
<p>
Stop Emacs and return to superior process.  You can resume later.<br>
If `cannot-suspend' is non-nil, or if the system doesn't support job<br>
control, run a subshell instead.<br>
<br>
If optional arg STUFFSTRING is non-nil, its characters are stuffed<br>
to be read as terminal input by Emacs's parent, after suspension.<br>
<br>
Before suspending, run the normal hook `suspend-hook'.<br>
After resumption run the normal hook `suspend-resume-hook'.<br>
<br>
Some operating systems cannot stop the Emacs process and resume it later.<br>
On such systems, Emacs starts a subshell instead of suspending.
