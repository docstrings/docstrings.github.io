<h3>Function: text-scale-set</h3>
<p>
Set the scale factor of the default face in the current buffer to LEVEL.
If LEVEL is non-zero, `text-scale-mode' is enabled, otherwise it is disabled.</p>
<p>
LEVEL is a number of steps, with 0 representing the default size.
Each step scales the height of the default face by the variable
`text-scale-mode-step' (a negative number decreases the height by
the same amount).</p>
