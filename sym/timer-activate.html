<h3>Function: timer-activate</h3>
<p>
Insert TIMER into `timer-list'.<br>
If TRIGGERED-P is t, make TIMER inactive (put it on the list, but<br>
mark it as already triggered).  To remove it, use `cancel-timer'.<br>
<br>
REUSE-CELL, if non-nil, is a cons cell to reuse when inserting<br>
TIMER into `timer-list' (usually a cell removed from that list by<br>
`cancel-timer-internal'; using this reduces consing for repeat<br>
timers).  If nil, allocate a new cell.</p>
