<h3>Function: timer-activate</h3>
<p>
Insert TIMER into `timer-list'.
If TRIGGERED-P is t, make TIMER inactive (put it on the list, but
mark it as already triggered).  To remove it, use `cancel-timer'.</p>
<p>
REUSE-CELL, if non-nil, is a cons cell to reuse when inserting
TIMER into `timer-list' (usually a cell removed from that list by
`cancel-timer-internal'; using this reduces consing for repeat
timers).  If nil, allocate a new cell.</p>
