<h3>Function: gnutls-boot</h3>
<p>
Initialize GnuTLS client for process PROC with TYPE+PROPLIST.
Currently only client mode is supported.  Return a success/failure
value you can check with `gnutls-errorp'.</p>
<p>
TYPE is a symbol, either `gnutls-anon' or `gnutls-x509pki'.
PROPLIST is a property list with the following keys:</p>
<p>
:hostname is a string naming the remote host.</p>
<p>
:priority is a GnuTLS priority string, defaults to "NORMAL".</p>
<p>
:trustfiles is a list of PEM-encoded trust files for `gnutls-x509pki'.</p>
<p>
:crlfiles is a list of PEM-encoded CRL lists for `gnutls-x509pki'.</p>
<p>
:keylist is an alist of PEM-encoded key files and PEM-encoded
certificates for `gnutls-x509pki'.</p>
<p>
:callbacks is an alist of callback functions, see below.</p>
<p>
:loglevel is the debug level requested from GnuTLS, try 4.</p>
<p>
:verify-flags is a bitset as per GnuTLS'
gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags.</p>
<p>
:verify-hostname-error, if non-nil, makes a hostname mismatch an
error.  Otherwise it will be just a warning.</p>
<p>
:min-prime-bits is the minimum accepted number of bits the client will
accept in Diffie-Hellman key exchange.</p>
<p>
The debug level will be set for this process AND globally for GnuTLS.
So if you set it higher or lower at any point, it affects global
debugging.</p>
<p>
Note that the priority is set on the client.  The server does not use
the protocols's priority except for disabling protocols that were not
specified.</p>
<p>
Processes must be initialized with this function before other GnuTLS
functions are used.  This function allocates resources which can only
be deallocated by calling `gnutls-deinit' or by calling it again.</p>
<p>
The callbacks alist can have a `verify' key, associated with a
verification function (UNUSED).</p>
<p>
Each authentication type may need additional information in order to
work.  For X.509 PKI (`gnutls-x509pki'), you probably need at least
one trustfile (usually a CA bundle).</p>
