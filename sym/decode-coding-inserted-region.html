<h3>Function: decode-coding-inserted-region</h3>
<p>
Decode the region between FROM and TO as if it is read from file FILENAME.<br>
The idea is that the text between FROM and TO was just inserted somehow.<br>
Optional arguments VISIT, BEG, END, and REPLACE are the same as those<br>
of the function `insert-file-contents'.<br>
Part of the job of this function is setting `buffer-undo-list' appropriately.</p>
