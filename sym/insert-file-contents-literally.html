<h3>Function: insert-file-contents-literally</h3>
<p>
Like `insert-file-contents', but only reads in the file literally.
A buffer may be modified in several ways after reading into the buffer,
to Emacs features such as format decoding, character code
conversion, `find-file-hook', automatic uncompression, etc.</p>
<p>
This function ensures that none of these modifications will take place.</p>
