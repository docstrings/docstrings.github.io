<h3>Function: next-single-property-change</h3>
<p>
Return the position of next property change for a specific property.
Scans characters forward from POSITION till it finds
a change in the PROP property, then returns the position of the change.
If the optional third argument OBJECT is a buffer (or nil, which means
the current buffer), POSITION is a buffer position (integer or marker).
If OBJECT is a string, POSITION is a 0-based index into it.
The property values are compared with `eq'.
Return nil if the property is constant all the way to the end of OBJECT.
If the value is non-nil, it is a position greater than POSITION, never equal.</p>
<p>
If the optional fourth argument LIMIT is non-nil, don't search
past position LIMIT; return LIMIT if nothing is found before LIMIT.</p>
