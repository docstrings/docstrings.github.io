<h3>Variable: input-method-exit-on-first-char</h3>
<p>
This flag controls when an input method returns.
Usually, the input method does not return while there's a possibility
that it may find a different translation if a user types another key.
But, if this flag is non-nil, the input method returns as soon as the
current key sequence gets long enough to have some valid translation.</p>
