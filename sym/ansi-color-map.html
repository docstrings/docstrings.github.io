<h3>Variable: ansi-color-map</h3>
<p>
A brand new color map suitable for `ansi-color-get-face'.</p>
<p>
The value of this variable is usually constructed by
`ansi-color-make-color-map'.  The values in the array are such that the
numbers included in an SGR control sequences point to the correct
foreground or background colors.</p>
<p>
Example: The sequence [34m specifies a blue foreground.  Therefore:
     (aref ansi-color-map 34)
          => (foreground-color . "blue")</p>
