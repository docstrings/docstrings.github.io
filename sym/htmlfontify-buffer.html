<h3>Function: htmlfontify-buffer</h3>
<p>
Create a new buffer, named for the current buffer + a .html extension,
containing an inline CSS-stylesheet and formatted CSS-markup HTML
that reproduces the look of the current Emacs buffer as closely
as possible.</p>
<p>
Dangerous characters in the existing buffer are turned into HTML
entities, so you should even be able to do HTML-within-HTML
fontified display.</p>
<p>
You should, however, note that random control or eight-bit
characters such as ^L () or Â¤ (244) won't get mapped yet.</p>
<p>
If the SRCDIR and FILE arguments are set, lookup etags derived
entries in the `hfy-tags-cache' and add HTML anchors and
hyperlinks as appropriate.</p>
