<h3>Function: set-time-zone-rule</h3>
<p>
Set the local time zone using TZ, a string specifying a time zone rule.
If TZ is nil, use implementation-defined default time zone information.
If TZ is t, use Universal Time.</p>
<p>
Instead of calling this function, you typically want (setenv "TZ" TZ).
That changes both the environment of the Emacs process and the
variable `process-environment', whereas `set-time-zone-rule' affects
only the former.</p>
<p>
(fn TZ)</p>
