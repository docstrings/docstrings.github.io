<h3>Function: tool-bar-local-item-from-menu</h3>
<p>
Define local tool bar binding for COMMAND using the given ICON.<br>
This makes a binding for COMMAND in IN-MAP, copying its binding from<br>
the menu bar in FROM-MAP (which defaults to `global-map'), but<br>
modifies the binding by adding an image specification for ICON.  It<br>
finds ICON just like `tool-bar-add-item'.  PROPS are additional<br>
properties to add to the binding.<br>
<br>
FROM-MAP must contain appropriate binding for `[menu-bar]' which
holds a keymap.</p>
