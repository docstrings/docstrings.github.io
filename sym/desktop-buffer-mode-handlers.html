<h3>Variable: desktop-buffer-mode-handlers</h3>
<p>
Alist of major mode specific functions to restore a desktop buffer.
Functions listed are called by `desktop-create-buffer' when `desktop-read'
evaluates the desktop file.  List elements must have the form</p>
<p>
   (MAJOR-MODE . RESTORE-BUFFER-FUNCTION).</p>
<p>
Buffers with a major mode not specified here, are restored by the default
handler `desktop-restore-file-buffer'.</p>
<p>
Handlers are called with argument list</p>
<p>
   (DESKTOP-BUFFER-FILE-NAME DESKTOP-BUFFER-NAME DESKTOP-BUFFER-MISC)</p>
<p>
Furthermore, they may use the following variables:</p>
<p>
   desktop-file-version
   desktop-buffer-major-mode
   desktop-buffer-minor-modes
   desktop-buffer-point
   desktop-buffer-mark
   desktop-buffer-read-only
   desktop-buffer-locals</p>
<p>
If a handler returns a buffer, then the saved mode settings
and variable values for that buffer are copied into it.</p>
<p>
Modules that define a major mode that needs a special handler should contain
code like</p>
<p>
   (defun foo-restore-desktop-buffer
   ...
   (add-to-list 'desktop-buffer-mode-handlers
                '(foo-mode . foo-restore-desktop-buffer))</p>
<p>
Furthermore the major mode function must be autoloaded.</p>
