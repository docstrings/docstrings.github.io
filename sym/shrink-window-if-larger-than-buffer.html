<h3>Function: shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer</h3>
<p>
Shrink height of WINDOW if its buffer doesn't need so many lines.<br>
More precisely, shrink WINDOW vertically to be as small as<br>
possible, while still showing the full contents of its buffer.<br>
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.<br>
<br>
Do not shrink WINDOW to less than `window-min-height' lines.  Do<br>
nothing if the buffer contains more lines than the present window<br>
height, or if some of the window's contents are scrolled out of<br>
view, or if shrinking this window would also shrink another<br>
window, or if the window is the only window of its frame.<br>
<br>
Return non-nil if the window was shrunk, nil otherwise.</p>
