<h3>Variable: track-eol</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means vertical motion starting at end of line keeps to ends of lines.<br>
This means moving to the end of each line moved onto.<br>
The beginning of a blank line does not count as the end of a line.<br>
This has no effect when `line-move-visual' is non-nil.</p>
