<h3>Function: Info-split</h3>
<p>
Split an info file into an indirect file plus bounded-size subfiles.
Each subfile will be up to the number of characters that
`Info-split-threshold' specifies, plus one node.</p>
<p>
To use this command, first visit a large Info file that has a tag
table.  The buffer is modified into a (small) indirect info file which
should be saved in place of the original visited file.</p>
<p>
The subfiles are written in the same directory the original file is
in, with names generated by appending `-' and a number to the original
file name.  The indirect file still functions as an Info file, but it
contains just the tag table and a directory of subfiles.</p>
