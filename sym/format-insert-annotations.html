<h3>Function: format-insert-annotations</h3>
<p>
Apply list of annotations to buffer as `write-region' would.
Insert each element of the given LIST of buffer annotations at its
appropriate place.  Use second arg OFFSET if the annotations' locations are
not relative to the beginning of the buffer: annotations will be inserted
at their location-OFFSET+1 (ie, the offset is treated as the position of
the first character in the buffer).</p>
