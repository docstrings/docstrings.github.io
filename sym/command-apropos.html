<h3>Function: command-apropos</h3>
<p>
Show commands (interactively callable functions) that match PATTERN.
PATTERN can be a word, a list of words (separated by spaces),
or a regexp (using some regexp special characters).  If it is a word,
search for matches for that word as a substring.  If it is a list of words,
search for matches for any two (or more) of those words.</p>
<p>
With C-u prefix, or if `apropos-do-all' is non-nil, also show
noninteractive functions.</p>
<p>
If VAR-PREDICATE is non-nil, show only variables, and only those that
satisfy the predicate VAR-PREDICATE.</p>
<p>
When called from a Lisp program, a string PATTERN is used as a regexp,
while a list of strings is used as a word list.</p>
