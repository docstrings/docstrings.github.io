<h3>Function: display-buffer-same-window</h3>
<p>
Display BUFFER in the selected window.<br>
This fails if ALIST has a non-nil `inhibit-same-window' entry, or<br>
if the selected window is a minibuffer window or is dedicated to<br>
another buffer; in that case, return nil.  Otherwise, return the<br>
selected window.</p>
