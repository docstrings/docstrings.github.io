<h3>Variable: delete-active-region</h3>
<p>
Whether single-char deletion commands delete an active region.
This has an effect only if Transient Mark mode is enabled, and
affects `delete-forward-char' and `delete-backward-char', though
not `delete-char'.</p>
<p>
If the value is the symbol `kill', the active region is killed
instead of deleted.</p>
