<h3>Function: window-body-height</h3>
<p>
Return the height, in lines, of WINDOW's text area.<br>
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.<br>
<br>
The returned height does not include the mode line or header line.<br>
On a graphical display, the height is expressed as an integer multiple<br>
of the default character height.  If a line at the bottom of the text<br>
area is only partially visible, that counts as a whole line; to<br>
exclude partially-visible lines, use `window-text-height'.
