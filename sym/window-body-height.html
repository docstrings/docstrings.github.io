<h3>Function: window-body-height</h3>
<p>
Return the height, in lines, of WINDOW's text area.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
The returned height does not include the mode line or header line.
On a graphical display, the height is expressed as an integer multiple
of the default character height.  If a line at the bottom of the text
area is only partially visible, that counts as a whole line; to
exclude partially-visible lines, use `window-text-height'.</p>
