<h3>Function: field-beginning</h3>
<p>
Return the beginning of the field surrounding POS.
A field is a region of text with the same `field' property.
If POS is nil, the value of point is used for POS.
If ESCAPE-FROM-EDGE is non-nil and POS is at the beginning of its
field, then the beginning of the *previous* field is returned.
If LIMIT is non-nil, it is a buffer position; if the beginning of the field
is before LIMIT, then LIMIT will be returned instead.</p>
