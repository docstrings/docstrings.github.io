<h3>Variable: interprogram-cut-function</h3>
<p>
Function to call to make a killed region available to other programs.<br>
Most window systems provide a facility for cutting and pasting<br>
text between different programs, such as the clipboard on X and<br>
MS-Windows, or the pasteboard on Nextstep/Mac OS.<br>
<br>
This variable holds a function that Emacs calls whenever text is<br>
put in the kill ring, to make the new kill available to other<br>
programs.  The function takes one argument, TEXT, which is a<br>
string containing the text which should be made available.</p>
