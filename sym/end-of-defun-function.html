<h3>Variable: end-of-defun-function</h3>
<p>
Function for `end-of-defun' to call.
This is used to find the end of the defun at point.
It is called with no argument, right after calling `beginning-of-defun-raw'.
So the function can assume that point is at the beginning of the defun body.
It should move point to the first position after the defun.</p>
