<h3>Function: sh-show-indent</h3>
<p>
Show the how the current line would be indented.<br>
This tells you which variable, if any, controls the indentation of<br>
this line.<br>
If optional arg ARG is non-null (called interactively with a prefix),<br>
a pop up window describes this variable.<br>
If variable `sh-blink' is non-nil then momentarily go to the line<br>
we are indenting relative to, if applicable.</p>
