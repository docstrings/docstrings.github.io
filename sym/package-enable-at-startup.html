<h3>Variable: package-enable-at-startup</h3>
<p>
Whether to activate installed packages when Emacs starts.<br>
If non-nil, packages are activated after reading the init file<br>
and before `after-init-hook'.  Activation is not done if<br>
`user-init-file' is nil (e.g. Emacs was started with "-q").<br>
<br>
Even if the value is nil, you can type M-x package-initialize to<br>
activate the package system at any time.</p>
