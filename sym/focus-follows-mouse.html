<h3>Variable: focus-follows-mouse</h3>
<p>
Non-nil if window system changes focus when you move the mouse.<br>
You should set this variable to tell Emacs how your window manager<br>
handles focus, since there is no way in general for Emacs to find out<br>
automatically.  See also `mouse-autoselect-window'.</p>
