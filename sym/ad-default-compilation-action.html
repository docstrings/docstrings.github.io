<h3>Variable: ad-default-compilation-action</h3>
<p>
Defines whether to compile advised definitions during activation.
A value of `always' will result in unconditional compilation, `never' will
always avoid compilation, `maybe' will compile if the byte-compiler is already
loaded, and `like-original' will compile if the original definition of the
advised function is compiled or a built-in function.  Every other value will
be interpreted as `maybe'.  This variable will only be considered if the
COMPILE argument of `ad-activate' was supplied as nil.</p>
