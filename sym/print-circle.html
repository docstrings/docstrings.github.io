<h3>Variable: print-circle</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means print recursive structures using #N= and #N# syntax.<br>
If nil, printing proceeds recursively and may lead to<br>
`max-lisp-eval-depth' being exceeded or an error may occur:<br>
"Apparently circular structure being printed."  Also see<br>
`print-length' and `print-level'.<br>
If non-nil, shared substructures anywhere in the structure are printed<br>
with `#N=' before the first occurrence (in the order of the print<br>
representation) and `#N#' in place of each subsequent occurrence,<br>
where N is a positive decimal integer.</p>
