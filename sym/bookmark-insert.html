<h3>Function: bookmark-insert</h3>
<p>
Insert the text of the file pointed to by bookmark BOOKMARK-NAME.
BOOKMARK-NAME is a bookmark name (a string), not a bookmark record.</p>
<p>
You may have a problem using this function if the value of variable
`bookmark-alist' is nil.  If that happens, you need to load in some
bookmarks.  See help on function `bookmark-load' for more about
this.</p>
<p>
(fn BOOKMARK-NAME)</p>
