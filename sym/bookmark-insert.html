<h3>Function: bookmark-insert</h3>
<p>
Insert the text of the file pointed to by bookmark BOOKMARK-NAME.<br>
BOOKMARK-NAME is a bookmark name (a string), not a bookmark record.<br>
<br>
You may have a problem using this function if the value of variable<br>
`bookmark-alist' is nil.  If that happens, you need to load in some<br>
bookmarks.  See help on function `bookmark-load' for more about<br>
this.
