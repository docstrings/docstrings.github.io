<h3>Function: ask-user-about-lock</h3>
<p>
Ask user what to do when he wants to edit FILE but it is locked by OPPONENT.<br>
This function has a choice of three things to do:<br>
  do (signal 'file-locked (list FILE OPPONENT))<br>
    to refrain from editing the file<br>
  return t (grab the lock on the file)<br>
  return nil (edit the file even though it is locked).<br>
You can redefine this function to choose among those three alternatives
in any way you like.</p>
