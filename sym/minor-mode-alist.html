<h3>Variable: minor-mode-alist</h3>
<p>
Alist saying how to show minor modes in the mode line.<br>
Each element looks like (VARIABLE STRING);<br>
STRING is included in the mode line if VARIABLE's value is non-nil.<br>
<br>
Actually, STRING need not be a string; any mode-line construct is<br>
okay.  See `mode-line-format'.</p>
