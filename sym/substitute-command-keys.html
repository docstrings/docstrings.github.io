<h3>Function: substitute-command-keys</h3>
<p>
Substitute key descriptions for command names in STRING.
Each substring of the form \[COMMAND] is replaced by either a
keystroke sequence that invokes COMMAND, or "M-x COMMAND" if COMMAND
is not on any keys.</p>
<p>
Each substring of the form \{MAPVAR} is replaced by a summary of
the value of MAPVAR as a keymap.  This summary is similar to the one
produced by `describe-bindings'.  The summary ends in two newlines
(used by the helper function `help-make-xrefs' to find the end of the
summary).</p>
<p>
Each substring of the form \<MAPVAR> specifies the use of MAPVAR
as the keymap for future \[COMMAND] substrings.
\= quotes the following character and is discarded;
thus, \=\= puts \= into the output, and \=\[ puts \[ into the output.</p>
<p>
Return the original STRING if no substitutions are made.
Otherwise, return a new string, without any text properties.</p>
