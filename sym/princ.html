<h3>Function: princ</h3>
<p>
Output the printed representation of OBJECT, any Lisp object.
No quoting characters are used; no delimiters are printed around
the contents of strings.</p>
<p>
OBJECT is any of the Lisp data types: a number, a string, a symbol,
a list, a buffer, a window, a frame, etc.</p>
<p>
A printed representation of an object is text which describes that object.</p>
<p>
Optional argument PRINTCHARFUN is the output stream, which can be one
of these:</p>
<p>
   - a buffer, in which case output is inserted into that buffer at point;
   - a marker, in which case output is inserted at marker's position;
   - a function, in which case that function is called once for each
     character of OBJECT's printed representation;
   - a symbol, in which case that symbol's function definition is called; or
   - t, in which case the output is displayed in the echo area.</p>
<p>
If PRINTCHARFUN is omitted, the value of `standard-output' (which see)
is used instead.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT &optional PRINTCHARFUN)</p>
