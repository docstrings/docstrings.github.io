<h3>Function: insert-text-button</h3>
<p>
Insert a button with the label LABEL.
The remaining arguments form a sequence of PROPERTY VALUE pairs,
specifying properties to add to the button.
In addition, the keyword argument :type may be used to specify a
button-type from which to inherit other properties; see
`define-button-type'.</p>
<p>
This function is like `insert-button', except that the button is
actually part of the text instead of being a property of the buffer.
Creating large numbers of buttons can also be somewhat faster using
`insert-text-button'.</p>
<p>
Also see `make-text-button'.</p>
