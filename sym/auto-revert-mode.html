<h3>Function: auto-revert-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle reverting buffer when the file changes (Auto Revert mode).<br>
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Auto Revert mode if ARG is<br>
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable<br>
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.<br>
<br>
Auto Revert mode is a minor mode that affects only the current<br>
buffer.  When enabled, it reverts the buffer when the file on<br>
disk changes.<br>
<br>
Use `global-auto-revert-mode' to automatically revert all buffers.<br>
Use `auto-revert-tail-mode' if you know that the file will only grow<br>
without being changed in the part that is already in the buffer.
