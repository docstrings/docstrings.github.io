<h3>Function: auto-revert-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle reverting buffer when the file changes (Auto Revert mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Auto Revert mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Auto Revert mode is a minor mode that affects only the current
buffer.  When enabled, it reverts the buffer when the file on
disk changes.</p>
<p>
Use `global-auto-revert-mode' to automatically revert all buffers.
Use `auto-revert-tail-mode' if you know that the file will only grow
without being changed in the part that is already in the buffer.</p>
