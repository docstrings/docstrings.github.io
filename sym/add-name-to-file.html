<h3>Function: add-name-to-file</h3>
<p>
Give FILE additional name NEWNAME.  Both args must be strings.<br>
Signals a `file-already-exists' error if a file NEWNAME already exists<br>
unless optional third argument OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS is non-nil.<br>
A number as third arg means request confirmation if NEWNAME already exists.<br>
This is what happens in interactive use with M-x.<br>
<br>
