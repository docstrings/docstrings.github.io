<h3>Variable: undo-limit</h3>
<p>
Keep no more undo information once it exceeds this size.
This limit is applied when garbage collection happens.
When a previous command increases the total undo list size past this
value, the earlier commands that came before it are forgotten.</p>

The size is counted as the number of bytes occupied,
which includes both saved text and other data.</p>
