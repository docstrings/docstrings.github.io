<h3>Variable: undo-limit</h3>
<p>
Keep no more undo information once it exceeds this size.<br>
This limit is applied when garbage collection happens.<br>
When a previous command increases the total undo list size past this<br>
value, the earlier commands that came before it are forgotten.<br>
<br>
The size is counted as the number of bytes occupied,<br>
which includes both saved text and other data.</p>
