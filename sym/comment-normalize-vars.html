<h3>Function: comment-normalize-vars</h3>
<p>
Check and set up variables needed by other commenting functions.<br>
All the `comment-*' commands call this function to set up various<br>
variables, like `comment-start', to ensure that the commenting<br>
functions work correctly.  Lisp callers of any other `comment-*'<br>
function should first call this function explicitly.<br>

(fn &optional NOERROR)</p>
