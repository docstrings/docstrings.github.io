<h3>Function: comment-normalize-vars</h3>
<p>
Check and set up variables needed by other commenting functions.
All the `comment-*' commands call this function to set up various
variables, like `comment-start', to ensure that the commenting
functions work correctly.  Lisp callers of any other `comment-*'
function should first call this function explicitly.</p>
