<h3>Function: auto-revert-tail-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle reverting tail of buffer when the file grows.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Auto-Revert Tail mode if ARG
is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,
enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When Auto Revert Tail mode is enabled, the tail of the file is
constantly followed, as with the shell command `tail -f'.  This
means that whenever the file grows on disk (presumably because
some background process is appending to it from time to time),
this is reflected in the current buffer.</p>
<p>
You can edit the buffer and turn this mode off and on again as
you please.  But make sure the background process has stopped
writing before you save the file!</p>
<p>
Use `auto-revert-mode' for changes other than appends!</p>
