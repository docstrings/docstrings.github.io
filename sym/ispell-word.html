<h3>Function: ispell-word</h3>
<p>
Check spelling of word under or before the cursor.
If the word is not found in dictionary, display possible corrections
in a window allowing you to choose one.</p>
<p>
If optional argument FOLLOWING is non-nil or if `ispell-following-word'
is non-nil when called interactively, then the following word
(rather than preceding) is checked when the cursor is not over a word.
When the optional argument QUIETLY is non-nil or `ispell-quietly' is non-nil
when called interactively, non-corrective messages are suppressed.</p>
<p>
With a prefix argument (or if CONTINUE is non-nil),
resume interrupted spell-checking of a buffer or region.</p>
<p>
Interactively, in Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, call
`ispell-region' to check the active region for spelling errors.</p>
<p>
Word syntax is controlled by the definition of the chosen dictionary,
which is in `ispell-local-dictionary-alist' or `ispell-dictionary-alist'.</p>
<p>
This will check or reload the dictionary.  Use M-x ispell-change-dictionary
or M-x ispell-region to update the Ispell process.</p>
