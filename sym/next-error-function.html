<h3>Variable: next-error-function</h3>
<p>
Function to use to find the next error in the current buffer.<br>
The function is called with 2 parameters:<br>
ARG is an integer specifying by how many errors to move.<br>
RESET is a boolean which, if non-nil, says to go back to the beginning<br>
of the errors before moving.<br>
Major modes providing compile-like functionality should set this variable<br>
to indicate to `next-error' that this is a candidate buffer and how
to navigate in it.</p>
