<h3>Function: jdb</h3>
<p>
Run jdb with command line COMMAND-LINE in a buffer.<br>
The buffer is named "*gud*" if no initial class is given or<br>
"*gud-<initial-class-basename>*" if there is.  If the "-classpath"<br>
switch is given, omit all whitespace between it and its value.<br>
<br>
See `gud-jdb-use-classpath' and `gud-jdb-classpath' documentation for<br>
information on how jdb accesses source files.  Alternatively (if<br>
`gud-jdb-use-classpath' is nil), see `gud-jdb-directories' for the<br>
original source file access method.<br>
<br>
For general information about commands available to control jdb from
gud, see `gud-mode'.
