<h3>Function: jdb</h3>
<p>
Run jdb with command line COMMAND-LINE in a buffer.
The buffer is named "*gud*" if no initial class is given or
"*gud-<initial-class-basename>*" if there is.  If the "-classpath"
switch is given, omit all whitespace between it and its value.</p>
<p>
See `gud-jdb-use-classpath' and `gud-jdb-classpath' documentation for
information on how jdb accesses source files.  Alternatively (if
`gud-jdb-use-classpath' is nil), see `gud-jdb-directories' for the
original source file access method.</p>
<p>
For general information about commands available to control jdb from
gud, see `gud-mode'.</p>
