<h3>Function: undo</h3>
<p>
Undo some previous changes.
Repeat this command to undo more changes.
A numeric ARG serves as a repeat count.</p>
<p>
In Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, only undo changes within
the current region.  Similarly, when not in Transient Mark mode, just C-u
as an argument limits undo to changes within the current region.</p>
