<h3>Function: cwarn-mode</h3>
<p>
Minor mode that highlights suspicious C and C++ constructions.</p>
<p>
Suspicious constructs are highlighted using `font-lock-warning-face'.</p>
<p>
Note, in addition to enabling this minor mode, the major mode must
be included in the variable `cwarn-configuration'.  By default C and
C++ modes are included.</p>
<p>
With a prefix argument ARG, enable the mode if ARG is positive,
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode
if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)</p>
