<h3>Function: ring-remove+insert+extend</h3>
<p>
`ring-remove' ITEM from RING, then `ring-insert+extend' it.<br>
This ensures that there is only one ITEM on RING.<br>
<br>
If the RING is full, behavior depends on GROW-P:<br>
  If GROW-P is non-nil, enlarge the ring to accommodate the new ITEM.<br>
  If GROW-P is nil, dump the oldest item to make room for the new.</p>
