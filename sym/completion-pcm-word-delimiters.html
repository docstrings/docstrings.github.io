<h3>Variable: completion-pcm-word-delimiters</h3>
<p>
A string of characters treated as word delimiters for completion.<br>
Some arcane rules:<br>
If `]' is in this string, it must come first.<br>
If `^' is in this string, it must not come first.<br>
If `-' is in this string, it must come first or right after `]'.<br>
In other words, if S is this string, then `[S]' must be a valid Emacs regular<br>
expression (not containing character ranges like `a-z').</p>
