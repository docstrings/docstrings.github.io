<h3>Function: custom-initialize-delay</h3>
<p>
Delay initialization of SYMBOL to the next Emacs start.
This is used in files that are preloaded (or for autoloaded
variables), so that the initialization is done in the run-time
context rather than the build-time context.  This also has the
side-effect that the (delayed) initialization is performed with
the :set function.</p>
<p>
For variables in preloaded files, you can simply use this
function for the :initialize property.  For autoloaded variables,
you will also need to add an autoload stanza calling this
function, and another one setting the standard-value property.
Or you can wrap the defcustom in a progn, to force the autoloader
to include all of it.</p>
