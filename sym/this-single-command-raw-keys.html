<h3>Function: this-single-command-raw-keys</h3>
<p>
Return the raw events that were read for this command.<br>
More generally, it returns the last key sequence read, either by<br>
the command loop or by `read-key-sequence'.<br>
Unlike `this-single-command-keys', this function's value<br>
shows the events before all translations (except for input methods).<br>
The value is always a vector.
