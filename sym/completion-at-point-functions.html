<h3>Variable: completion-at-point-functions</h3>
<p>
Special hook to find the completion table for the thing at point.
Each function on this hook is called in turns without any argument and should
return either nil to mean that it is not applicable at point,
or a function of no argument to perform completion (discouraged),
or a list of the form (START END COLLECTION . PROPS) where
 START and END delimit the entity to complete and should include point,
 COLLECTION is the completion table to use to complete it, and
 PROPS is a property list for additional information.
Currently supported properties are all the properties that can appear in
`completion-extra-properties' plus:
 `:predicate'	a predicate that completion candidates need to satisfy.
 `:exclusive'	If `no', means that if the completion table fails to
   match the text at point, then instead of reporting a completion
   failure, the completion should try the next completion function.
As is the case with most hooks, the functions are responsible to preserve
things like point and current buffer.</p>
