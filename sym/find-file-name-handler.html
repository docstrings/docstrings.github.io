<h3>Function: find-file-name-handler</h3>
<p>
Return FILENAME's handler function for OPERATION, if it has one.<br>
Otherwise, return nil.<br>
A file name is handled if one of the regular expressions in<br>
`file-name-handler-alist' matches it.<br>
<br>
If OPERATION equals `inhibit-file-name-operation', then we ignore<br>
any handlers that are members of `inhibit-file-name-handlers',<br>
but we still do run any other handlers.  This lets handlers<br>
use the standard functions without calling themselves recursively.
