<h3>Function: shell-dynamic-complete-command</h3>
<p>
Dynamically complete the command at point.<br>
This function is similar to `comint-dynamic-complete-filename', except that it<br>
searches `exec-path' (minus the trailing Emacs library path) for completion<br>
candidates.  Note that this may not be the same as the shell's idea of the<br>
path.<br>
<br>
Completion is dependent on the value of `shell-completion-execonly', plus<br>
those that effect file completion.<br>

Returns t if successful.
