<h3>Function: shell-dynamic-complete-command</h3>
<p>
Dynamically complete the command at point.
This function is similar to `comint-dynamic-complete-filename', except that it
searches `exec-path' (minus the trailing Emacs library path) for completion
candidates.  Note that this may not be the same as the shell's idea of the
path.</p>
<p>
Completion is dependent on the value of `shell-completion-execonly', plus
those that effect file completion.</p>
<p>
Returns t if successful.</p>
<p>
