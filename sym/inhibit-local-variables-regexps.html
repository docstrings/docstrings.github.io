<h3>Variable: inhibit-local-variables-regexps</h3>
<p>
List of regexps matching file names in which to ignore local variables.
This includes `-*-' lines as well as trailing "Local Variables" sections.
Files matching this list are typically binary file formats.
They may happen to contain sequences that look like local variable
specifications, but are not really, or they may be containers for
member files with their own local variable sections, which are
not appropriate for the containing file.
See also `inhibit-local-variables-suffixes'.</p>
