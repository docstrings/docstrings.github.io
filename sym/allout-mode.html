<h3>Function: allout-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle Allout outline mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Allout outline mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `allout-mode-map-value', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
Allout outline mode is a minor mode that provides extensive
outline oriented formatting and manipulation.  It enables
structural editing of outlines, as well as navigation and
exposure.  It also is specifically aimed at accommodating
syntax-sensitive text like programming languages.  (For example,
see the allout code itself, which is organized as an allout
outline.)</p>
<p>
In addition to typical outline navigation and exposure, allout includes:</p>
<p>
 - topic-oriented authoring, including keystroke-based topic creation,
   repositioning, promotion/demotion, cut, and paste
 - incremental search with dynamic exposure and reconcealment of hidden text
 - adjustable format, so programming code can be developed in outline-structure
 - easy topic encryption and decryption, symmetric or key-pair
 - "Hot-spot" operation, for single-keystroke maneuvering and exposure control
 - integral outline layout, for automatic initial exposure when visiting a file
 - independent extensibility, using comprehensive exposure and authoring hooks</p>
<p>
and many other features.</p>
<p>
Below is a description of the key bindings, and then description
of special `allout-mode' features and terminology.  See also the
outline menubar additions for quick reference to many of the
features.  Customize `allout-auto-activation' to prepare your
Emacs session for automatic activation of `allout-mode'.</p>
<p>
The bindings are those listed in `allout-prefixed-keybindings'
and `allout-unprefixed-keybindings'.  We recommend customizing
`allout-command-prefix' to use just `\C-c' as the command
prefix, if the allout bindings don't conflict with any personal
bindings you have on \C-c.  In any case, outline structure
navigation and authoring is simplified by positioning the cursor
on an item's bullet character, the "hot-spot" -- then you can
invoke allout commands with just the un-prefixed,
un-control-shifted command letters.  This is described further in
the HOT-SPOT Operation section.</p>

<p>
                  Topic Encryption</p>
<p>
Outline mode supports gpg encryption of topics, with support for
symmetric and key-pair modes, and auto-encryption of topics
pending encryption on save.</p>
<p>
Topics pending encryption are, by default, automatically
encrypted during file saves, including checkpoint saves, to avoid
exposing the plain text of encrypted topics in the file system.
If the content of the topic containing the cursor was encrypted
for a save, it is automatically decrypted for continued editing.</p>
<p>
NOTE: A few GnuPG v2 versions improperly preserve incorrect
symmetric decryption keys, preventing entry of the correct key on
subsequent decryption attempts until the cache times-out.  That
can take several minutes.  (Decryption of other entries is not
affected.)  Upgrade your EasyPG version, if you can, and you can
deliberately clear your gpg-agent's cache by sending it a '-HUP'
signal.</p>
<p>
See `allout-toggle-current-subtree-encryption' function docstring
and `allout-encrypt-unencrypted-on-saves' customization variable
for details.</p>
<p>
                 HOT-SPOT Operation</p>
<p>
Hot-spot operation provides a means for easy, single-keystroke outline
navigation and exposure control.</p>
<p>
When the text cursor is positioned directly on the bullet character of
a topic, regular characters (a to z) invoke the commands of the
corresponding allout-mode keymap control chars.  For example, "f"
would invoke the command typically bound to "C-c<space>C-f"
(M-x allout-forward-current-level `allout-forward-current-level').</p>
<p>
Thus, by positioning the cursor on a topic bullet, you can
execute the outline navigation and manipulation commands with a
single keystroke.  Regular navigation keys (eg, C-f, C-n) don't get
this special translation, so you can use them to get out of the
hot-spot and back to normal editing operation.</p>
<p>
In allout-mode, the normal beginning-of-line command (M-x allout-beginning-of-line) is
replaced with one that makes it easy to get to the hot-spot.  If you
repeat it immediately it cycles (if `allout-beginning-of-line-cycles'
is set) to the beginning of the item and then, if you hit it again
immediately, to the hot-spot.  Similarly, `allout-beginning-of-current-entry'
(M-x allout-beginning-of-current-entry) moves to the hot-spot when the cursor is already located
at the beginning of the current entry.</p>
<p>
                             Extending Allout</p>
<p>
Allout exposure and authoring activities all have associated
hooks, by which independent code can cooperate with allout
without changes to the allout core.  Here are key ones:</p>
<p>
`allout-mode-hook'
`allout-mode-deactivate-hook' (deprecated)
`allout-mode-off-hook'
`allout-exposure-change-functions'
`allout-structure-added-functions'
`allout-structure-deleted-functions'
`allout-structure-shifted-functions'
`allout-after-copy-or-kill-hook'
`allout-post-undo-hook'</p>
<p>
                            Terminology</p>
<p>
Topic hierarchy constituents -- TOPICS and SUBTOPICS:</p>
<p>
ITEM:   A unitary outline element, including the HEADER and ENTRY text.
TOPIC:  An ITEM and any ITEMs contained within it, ie having greater DEPTH
        and with no intervening items of lower DEPTH than the container.
CURRENT ITEM:
        The visible ITEM most immediately containing the cursor.
DEPTH:  The degree of nesting of an ITEM; it increases with containment.
        The DEPTH is determined by the HEADER PREFIX.  The DEPTH is also
        called the:
LEVEL:  The same as DEPTH.</p>
<p>
ANCESTORS:
        Those ITEMs whose TOPICs contain an ITEM.
PARENT: An ITEM's immediate ANCESTOR.  It has a DEPTH one less than that
        of the ITEM.
OFFSPRING:
        The ITEMs contained within an ITEM's TOPIC.
SUBTOPIC:
        An OFFSPRING of its ANCESTOR TOPICs.
CHILD:
        An immediate SUBTOPIC of its PARENT.
SIBLINGS:
        TOPICs having the same PARENT and DEPTH.</p>
<p>
Topic text constituents:</p>
<p>
HEADER: The first line of an ITEM, include the ITEM PREFIX and HEADER
        text.
ENTRY:  The text content of an ITEM, before any OFFSPRING, but including
        the HEADER text and distinct from the ITEM PREFIX.
BODY:   Same as ENTRY.
PREFIX: The leading text of an ITEM which distinguishes it from normal
        ENTRY text.  Allout recognizes the outline structure according
        to the strict PREFIX format.  It consists of a PREFIX-LEAD string,
        PREFIX-PADDING, and a BULLET.  The BULLET might be followed by a
        number, indicating the ordinal number of the topic among its
        siblings, or an asterisk indicating encryption, plus an optional
        space.  After that is the ITEM HEADER text, which is not part of
        the PREFIX.</p>
<p>
        The relative length of the PREFIX determines the nesting DEPTH
        of the ITEM.
PREFIX-LEAD:
        The string at the beginning of a HEADER PREFIX, by default a `.'.
        It can be customized by changing the setting of
        `allout-header-prefix' and then reinitializing `allout-mode'.</p>
<p>
        When the PREFIX-LEAD is set to the comment-string of a
        programming language, outline structuring can be embedded in
        program code without interfering with processing of the text
        (by Emacs or the language processor) as program code.  This
        setting happens automatically when allout mode is used in
        programming-mode buffers.  See `allout-use-mode-specific-leader'
        docstring for more detail.
PREFIX-PADDING:
        Spaces or asterisks which separate the PREFIX-LEAD and the
        bullet, determining the ITEM's DEPTH.
BULLET: A character at the end of the ITEM PREFIX, it must be one of
        the characters listed on `allout-plain-bullets-string' or
        `allout-distinctive-bullets-string'.  When creating a TOPIC,
        plain BULLETs are by default used, according to the DEPTH of the
        TOPIC.  Choice among the distinctive BULLETs is offered when you
        provide a universal argument (C-u) to the
        TOPIC creation command, or when explicitly rebulleting a TOPIC.  The
        significance of the various distinctive bullets is purely by
        convention.  See the documentation for the above bullet strings for
        more details.
EXPOSURE:
        The state of a TOPIC which determines the on-screen visibility
        of its OFFSPRING and contained ENTRY text.
CONCEALED:
        TOPICs and ENTRY text whose EXPOSURE is inhibited.  Concealed
        text is represented by "..." ellipses.</p>
<p>
        CONCEALED TOPICs are effectively collapsed within an ANCESTOR.
CLOSED: A TOPIC whose immediate OFFSPRING and body-text is CONCEALED.
OPEN:	A TOPIC that is not CLOSED, though its OFFSPRING or BODY may be.</p>
<p>
