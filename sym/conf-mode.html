<h3>Function: conf-mode</h3>
<p>
Mode for Unix and Windows Conf files and Java properties.<br>
Most conf files know only three kinds of constructs: parameter<br>
assignments optionally grouped into sections and comments.  Yet<br>
there is a great range of variation in the exact syntax of conf<br>
files.  See below for various wrapper commands that set up the<br>
details for some of the most widespread variants.<br>
<br>
This mode sets up font locking, outline, imenu and it provides<br>
alignment support through `conf-align-assignments'.  If strings<br>
come out wrong, try `conf-quote-normal'.<br>
<br>
Some files allow continuation lines, either with a backslash at<br>
the end of line, or by indenting the next line (further).  These<br>
constructs cannot currently be recognized.<br>
<br>
Because of this great variety of nuances, which are often not<br>
even clearly specified, please don't expect it to get every file<br>
quite right.  Patches that clearly identify some special case,<br>
without breaking the general ones, are welcome.<br>
<br>
If instead you start this mode with the generic `conf-mode'<br>
command, it will parse the buffer.  It will generally well<br>
identify the first four cases listed below.  If the buffer<br>
doesn't have enough contents to decide, this is identical to<br>
`conf-windows-mode' on Windows, elsewhere to `conf-unix-mode'.<br>
See also `conf-space-mode', `conf-colon-mode', `conf-javaprop-mode',<br>
`conf-ppd-mode' and `conf-xdefaults-mode'.


Uses keymap `conf-mode-map', which is not currently defined.
