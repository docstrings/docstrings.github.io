<h3>Function: minor-mode-key-binding</h3>
<p>
Find the visible minor mode bindings of KEY.
Return an alist of pairs (MODENAME . BINDING), where MODENAME is
the symbol which names the minor mode binding KEY, and BINDING is
KEY's definition in that mode.  In particular, if KEY has no
minor-mode bindings, return nil.  If the first binding is a
non-prefix, all subsequent bindings will be omitted, since they would
be ignored.  Similarly, the list doesn't include non-prefix bindings
that come after prefix bindings.</p>
<p>
If optional argument ACCEPT-DEFAULT is non-nil, recognize default
bindings; see the description of `lookup-key' for more details about this.</p>
