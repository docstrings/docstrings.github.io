<h3>Function: temp-buffer-resize-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle auto-resizing temporary buffer windows (Temp Buffer Resize Mode).<br>
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Temp Buffer Resize mode if ARG<br>
is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,<br>
enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.<br>
<br>
When Temp Buffer Resize mode is enabled, the windows in which we<br>
show a temporary buffer are automatically resized in height to<br>
fit the buffer's contents, but never more than<br>
`temp-buffer-max-height' nor less than `window-min-height'.<br>
<br>
A window is resized only if it has been specially created for the<br>
buffer.  Windows that have shown another buffer before are not<br>
resized.  A frame is resized only if `fit-frame-to-buffer' is<br>
non-nil.<br>
<br>
This mode is used by `help', `apropos' and `completion' buffers,
and some others.</p>
<h3>Variable: temp-buffer-resize-mode</h3>
<p>
Non-nil if Temp-Buffer-Resize mode is enabled.<br>
See the command `temp-buffer-resize-mode' for a description of this minor mode.<br>
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;<br>
either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')<br>
or call the function `temp-buffer-resize-mode'.</p>
