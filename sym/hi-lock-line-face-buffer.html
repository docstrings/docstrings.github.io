<h3>Function: hi-lock-line-face-buffer</h3>
<p>
Set face of all lines containing a match of REGEXP to FACE.
Interactively, prompt for REGEXP then FACE, using a buffer-local
history list for REGEXP and a global history list for FACE.</p>

highlight REGEXP.  If Font Lock mode is disabled, overlays are
used for highlighting; in this case, the highlighting will not be
updated as you type.</p>
