<h3>Function: rfn-eshadow-update-overlay</h3>
<p>
Update `rfn-eshadow-overlay' to cover shadowed part of minibuffer input.
This is intended to be used as a minibuffer `post-command-hook' for
`file-name-shadow-mode'; the minibuffer should have already
been set up by `rfn-eshadow-setup-minibuffer'.</p>
