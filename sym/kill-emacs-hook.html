<h3>Variable: kill-emacs-hook</h3>
<p>
Hook run when `kill-emacs' is called.<br>
Since `kill-emacs' may be invoked when the terminal is disconnected (or<br>
in other similar situations), functions placed on this hook should not<br>
expect to be able to interact with the user.  To ask for confirmation,<br>
see `kill-emacs-query-functions' instead.<br>
<br>
Before Emacs 24.1, the hook was not run in batch mode, i.e., if<br>
`noninteractive' was non-nil.</p>
