<h3>Function: length</h3>
<p>
Return the length of vector, list or string SEQUENCE.
A byte-code function object is also allowed.
If the string contains multibyte characters, this is not necessarily
the number of bytes in the string; it is the number of characters.
To get the number of bytes, use `string-bytes'.</p>
