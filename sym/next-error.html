<h3>Function: next-error</h3>
<p>
Visit next `next-error' message and corresponding source code.</p>
<p>
If all the error messages parsed so far have been processed already,
the message buffer is checked for new ones.</p>
<p>
A prefix ARG specifies how many error messages to move;
negative means move back to previous error messages.
Just C-u as a prefix means reparse the error message buffer
and start at the first error.</p>
<p>
The RESET argument specifies that we should restart from the beginning.</p>
<p>
C-x ` normally uses the most recently started
compilation, grep, or occur buffer.  It can also operate on any
buffer with output from the M-x compile, M-x grep commands, or,
more generally, on any buffer in Compilation mode or with
Compilation Minor mode enabled, or any buffer in which
`next-error-function' is bound to an appropriate function.
To specify use of a particular buffer for error messages, type
C-x ` in that buffer when it is the only one displayed
in the current frame.</p>
<p>
Once C-x ` has chosen the buffer for error messages, it
runs `next-error-hook' with `run-hooks', and stays with that buffer
until you use it in some other buffer which uses Compilation mode
or Compilation Minor mode.</p>
<p>
To control which errors are matched, customize the variable
`compilation-error-regexp-alist'.</p>
