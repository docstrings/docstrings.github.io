<h3>Function: delete-forward-char</h3>
<p>
Delete the following N characters (previous if N is negative).<br>
If Transient Mark mode is enabled, the mark is active, and N is 1,<br>
delete the text in the region and deactivate the mark instead.<br>
To disable this, set `delete-active-region' to nil.<br>
<br>
Optional second arg KILLFLAG non-nil means to kill (save in kill<br>
ring) instead of delete.  Interactively, N is the prefix arg, and<br>
KILLFLAG is set if N was explicitly specified.</p>
