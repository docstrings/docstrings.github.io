<h3>Function: capitalized-words-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle Capitalized Words mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Capitalized Words mode if ARG
is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,
enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Capitalized Words mode is a buffer-local minor mode.  When
enabled, a word boundary occurs immediately before an uppercase
letter in a symbol.  This is in addition to all the normal
boundaries given by the syntax and category tables.  There is no
restriction to ASCII.</p>
<p>
E.g. the beginning of words in the following identifier are as marked:</p>
<p>
  capitalizedWorDD
  ^          ^  ^^</p>
<p>
Note that these word boundaries only apply for word motion and
marking commands such as M-f.  This mode does not affect word
boundaries found by regexp matching (`\>', `\w' &c).</p>
<p>
This style of identifiers is common in environments like Java ones,
where underscores aren't trendy enough.  Capitalization rules are
sometimes part of the language, e.g. Haskell, which may thus encourage
such a style.  It is appropriate to add `capitalized-words-mode' to
the mode hook for programming language modes in which you encounter
variables like this, e.g. `java-mode-hook'.  It's unlikely to cause
trouble if such identifiers aren't used.</p>
