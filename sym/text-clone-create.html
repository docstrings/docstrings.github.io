<h3>Function: text-clone-create</h3>
<p>
Create a text clone of START...END at point.
Text clones are chunks of text that are automatically kept identical:
changes done to one of the clones will be immediately propagated to the other.</p>
<p>
The buffer's content at point is assumed to be already identical to
the one between START and END.
If SYNTAX is provided it's a regexp that describes the possible text of
the clones; the clone will be shrunk or killed if necessary to ensure that
its text matches the regexp.
If SPREADP is non-nil it indicates that text inserted before/after the
clone should be incorporated in the clone.</p>
