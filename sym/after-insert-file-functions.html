<h3>Variable: after-insert-file-functions</h3>
<p>
A list of functions to be called at the end of `insert-file-contents'.
Each is passed one argument, the number of characters inserted,
with point at the start of the inserted text.  Each function
should leave point the same, and return the new character count.
If `insert-file-contents' is intercepted by a handler from
`file-name-handler-alist', that handler is responsible for calling the
functions in `after-insert-file-functions' if appropriate.</p>
