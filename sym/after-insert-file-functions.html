<h3>Variable: after-insert-file-functions</h3>
<p>
A list of functions to be called at the end of `insert-file-contents'.<br>
Each is passed one argument, the number of characters inserted,<br>
with point at the start of the inserted text.  Each function<br>
should leave point the same, and return the new character count.<br>
If `insert-file-contents' is intercepted by a handler from<br>
`file-name-handler-alist', that handler is responsible for calling the<br>
functions in `after-insert-file-functions' if appropriate.</p>
