<h3>Variable: command-line-functions</h3>
<p>
List of functions to process unrecognized command-line arguments.
Each function should access the dynamically bound variables
`argi' (the current argument) and `command-line-args-left' (the remaining
arguments).  The function should return non-nil only if it recognizes and
processes `argi'.  If it does so, it may consume successive arguments by
altering `command-line-args-left' to remove them.</p>
