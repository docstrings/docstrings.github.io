<h3>Function: follow-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle Follow mode.<br>
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Follow mode if ARG is<br>
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable<br>
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.<br>
<br>
Follow mode is a minor mode that combines windows into one tall<br>
virtual window.  This is accomplished by two main techniques:<br>
<br>
* The windows always displays adjacent sections of the buffer.<br>
  This means that whenever one window is moved, all the<br>
  others will follow.  (Hence the name Follow mode.)<br>
<br>
* Should the point (cursor) end up outside a window, another<br>
  window displaying that point is selected, if possible.  This<br>
  makes it possible to walk between windows using normal cursor<br>
  movement commands.<br>
<br>
Follow mode comes to its prime when used on a large screen and two<br>
side-by-side windows are used.  The user can, with the help of Follow<br>
mode, use two full-height windows as though they would have been<br>
one.  Imagine yourself editing a large function, or section of text,<br>
and being able to use 144 lines instead of the normal 72... (your<br>
mileage may vary).<br>
<br>
To split one large window into two side-by-side windows, the commands<br>
`C-x 3' or `M-x follow-delete-other-windows-and-split' can be used.<br>
<br>
Only windows displayed in the same frame follow each other.<br>
<br>
This command runs the normal hook `follow-mode-hook'.
