<h3>Function: follow-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle Follow mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Follow mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Follow mode is a minor mode that combines windows into one tall
virtual window.  This is accomplished by two main techniques:</p>
<p>
* The windows always displays adjacent sections of the buffer.
  This means that whenever one window is moved, all the
  others will follow.  (Hence the name Follow mode.)</p>
<p>
* Should the point (cursor) end up outside a window, another
  window displaying that point is selected, if possible.  This
  makes it possible to walk between windows using normal cursor
  movement commands.</p>
<p>
Follow mode comes to its prime when used on a large screen and two
side-by-side windows are used.  The user can, with the help of Follow
mode, use two full-height windows as though they would have been
one.  Imagine yourself editing a large function, or section of text,
and being able to use 144 lines instead of the normal 72... (your
mileage may vary).</p>
<p>
To split one large window into two side-by-side windows, the commands
`C-x 3' or `M-x follow-delete-other-windows-and-split' can be used.</p>
<p>
Only windows displayed in the same frame follow each other.</p>
<p>
This command runs the normal hook `follow-mode-hook'.</p>

Keys specific to Follow mode:</p>

Uses keymap `follow-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
