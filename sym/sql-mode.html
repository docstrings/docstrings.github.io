<h3>Function: sql-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode to edit SQL.<br>
<br>
You can send SQL statements to the SQLi buffer using<br>
M-x sql-send-region.  Such a buffer must exist before you can do this.<br>
See `sql-help' on how to create SQLi buffers.<br>
<br>
<br>
Uses keymap `sql-mode-map', which is not currently defined.<br>
<br>
Customization: Entry to this mode runs the `sql-mode-hook'.<br>
<br>
When you put a buffer in SQL mode, the buffer stores the last SQLi<br>
buffer created as its destination in the variable `sql-buffer'.  This<br>
will be the buffer M-x sql-send-region sends the region to.  If this<br>
SQLi buffer is killed, M-x sql-send-region is no longer able to<br>
determine where the strings should be sent to.  You can set the<br>
value of `sql-buffer' using M-x sql-set-sqli-buffer.<br>
<br>
For information on how to create multiple SQLi buffers, see<br>
`sql-interactive-mode'.<br>
<br>
Note that SQL doesn't have an escape character unless you specify<br>
one.  If you specify backslash as escape character in SQL, you<br>
must tell Emacs.  Here's how to do that in your init file:<br>
<br>
(add-hook 'sql-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
	    (modify-syntax-entry ?\\ "." sql-mode-syntax-table)))
