<h3>Variable: frame-title-format</h3>
<p>
Template for displaying the title bar of visible frames.
(Assuming the window manager supports this feature.)</p>
<p>
This variable has the same structure as `mode-line-format', except that
the %c and %l constructs are ignored.  It is used only on frames for
which no explicit name has been set (see `modify-frame-parameters').</p>
