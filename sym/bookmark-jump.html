<h3>Function: bookmark-jump</h3>
<p>
Jump to bookmark BOOKMARK (a point in some file).
You may have a problem using this function if the value of variable
`bookmark-alist' is nil.  If that happens, you need to load in some
bookmarks.  See help on function `bookmark-load' for more about
this.</p>
<p>
If the file pointed to by BOOKMARK no longer exists, you will be asked
if you wish to give the bookmark a new location, and `bookmark-jump'
will then jump to the new location, as well as recording it in place
of the old one in the permanent bookmark record.</p>
<p>
BOOKMARK is usually a bookmark name (a string).  It can also be a
bookmark record, but this is usually only done by programmatic callers.</p>
<p>
If DISPLAY-FUNC is non-nil, it is a function to invoke to display the
bookmark.  It defaults to `switch-to-buffer'.  A typical value for
DISPLAY-FUNC would be `switch-to-buffer-other-window'.</p>
