<h3>Function: perl-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for editing Perl code.
Expression and list commands understand all Perl brackets.
Tab indents for Perl code.
Comments are delimited with # ... \n.
Paragraphs are separated by blank lines only.
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `perl-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>

Variables controlling indentation style:
 `perl-tab-always-indent'
    Non-nil means TAB in Perl mode should always indent the current line,
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 `perl-tab-to-comment'
    Non-nil means that for lines which don't need indenting, TAB will
    either delete an empty comment, indent an existing comment, move
    to end-of-line, or if at end-of-line already, create a new comment.
 `perl-nochange'
    Lines starting with this regular expression are not auto-indented.
 `perl-indent-level'
    Indentation of Perl statements within surrounding block.
    The surrounding block's indentation is the indentation
    of the line on which the open-brace appears.
 `perl-continued-statement-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a substatement, such as the
    then-clause of an if or body of a while.
 `perl-continued-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a brace that starts a substatement.
    This is in addition to `perl-continued-statement-offset'.
 `perl-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation for line if it starts with an open brace.
 `perl-brace-imaginary-offset'
    An open brace following other text is treated as if it were
    this far to the right of the start of its line.
 `perl-label-offset'
    Extra indentation for line that is a label.
 `perl-indent-continued-arguments'
    Offset of argument lines relative to usual indentation.</p>
