<h3>Function: hack-local-variables-filter</h3>
<p>
Filter local variable settings, querying the user if necessary.
VARIABLES is the alist of variable-value settings.  This alist is
 filtered based on the values of `ignored-local-variables',
 `enable-local-eval', `enable-local-variables', and (if necessary)
 user interaction.  The results are added to
 `file-local-variables-alist', without applying them.
If these settings come from directory-local variables, then
DIR-NAME is the name of the associated directory.  Otherwise it is nil.</p>
