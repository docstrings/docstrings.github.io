<h3>Variable: Buffer-menu-use-frame-buffer-list</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, the Buffer Menu uses the selected frame's buffer list.<br>
Buffers that were never selected in that frame are listed at the end.<br>
If the value is nil, the Buffer Menu uses the global buffer list.<br>
This variable matters if the Buffer Menu is sorted by visited order,<br>
as it is by default.</p>
