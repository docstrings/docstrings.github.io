<h3>Variable: Buffer-menu-use-frame-buffer-list</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, the Buffer Menu uses the selected frame's buffer list.
Buffers that were never selected in that frame are listed at the end.
If the value is nil, the Buffer Menu uses the global buffer list.
This variable matters if the Buffer Menu is sorted by visited order,
as it is by default.</p>
