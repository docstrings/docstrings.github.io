<h3>Function: beginning-of-line</h3>
<p>
Move point to beginning of current line (in the logical order).
With argument N not nil or 1, move forward N - 1 lines first.
If point reaches the beginning or end of buffer, it stops there.</p>
<p>
This function constrains point to the current field unless this moves
point to a different line than the original, unconstrained result.
If N is nil or 1, and a front-sticky field starts at point, the point
does not move.  To ignore field boundaries bind
`inhibit-field-text-motion' to t, or use the `forward-line' function
instead.  For instance, `(forward-line 0)' does the same thing as
`(beginning-of-line)', except that it ignores field boundaries.</p>
