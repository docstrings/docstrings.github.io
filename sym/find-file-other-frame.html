<h3>Function: find-file-other-frame</h3>
<p>
Edit file FILENAME, in another frame.<br>
<br>
Like C-x C-f (which see), but creates a new frame or reuses<br>
an existing one.  See the function `display-buffer'.<br>
<br>
Interactively, the default if you just type RET is the current directory,<br>
but the visited file name is available through the minibuffer history:<br>
type M-n to pull it into the minibuffer.<br>
<br>
Interactively, or if WILDCARDS is non-nil in a call from Lisp,<br>
expand wildcards (if any) and visit multiple files.</p>
