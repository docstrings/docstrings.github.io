<h3>Function: find-file-other-frame</h3>
<p>
Edit file FILENAME, in another frame.</p>
<p>
Like C-x C-f (which see), but creates a new frame or reuses
an existing one.  See the function `display-buffer'.</p>
<p>
Interactively, the default if you just type RET is the current directory,
but the visited file name is available through the minibuffer history:
type M-n to pull it into the minibuffer.</p>
<p>
Interactively, or if WILDCARDS is non-nil in a call from Lisp,
expand wildcards (if any) and visit multiple files.</p>
