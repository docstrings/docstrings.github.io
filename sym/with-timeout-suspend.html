<h3>Function: with-timeout-suspend</h3>
<p>
Stop the clock for `with-timeout'.  Used by debuggers.<br>
The idea is that the time you spend in the debugger should not<br>
count against these timeouts.<br>
<br>
The value is a list that the debugger can pass to `with-timeout-unsuspend'<br>
when it exits, to make these timers start counting again.</p>
