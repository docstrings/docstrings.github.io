<h3>Variable: max-image-size</h3>
<p>
Maximum size of images.<br>
Emacs will not load an image into memory if its pixel width or<br>
pixel height exceeds this limit.<br>
<br>
If the value is an integer, it directly specifies the maximum<br>
image height and width, measured in pixels.  If it is a floating<br>
point number, it specifies the maximum image height and width<br>
as a ratio to the frame height and width.  If the value is<br>
non-numeric, there is no explicit limit on the size of images.</p>
