<h3>Variable: font-encoding-alist</h3>
<p>
Alist of fontname patterns vs the corresponding encoding and repertory info.
Each element looks like (REGEXP . (ENCODING . REPERTORY)),
where ENCODING is a charset or a char-table,
and REPERTORY is a charset, a char-table, or nil.</p>
<p>
If ENCODING and REPERTORY are the same, the element can have the form
(REGEXP . ENCODING).</p>
<p>
ENCODING is for converting a character to a glyph code of the font.
If ENCODING is a charset, encoding a character by the charset gives
the corresponding glyph code.  If ENCODING is a char-table, looking up
the table by a character gives the corresponding glyph code.</p>
<p>
REPERTORY specifies a repertory of characters supported by the font.
If REPERTORY is a charset, all characters belonging to the charset are
supported.  If REPERTORY is a char-table, all characters who have a
non-nil value in the table are supported.  If REPERTORY is nil, Emacs
gets the repertory information by an opened font and ENCODING.</p>
