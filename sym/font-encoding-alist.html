<h3>Variable: font-encoding-alist</h3>
<p>
Alist of fontname patterns vs the corresponding encoding and repertory info.<br>
Each element looks like (REGEXP . (ENCODING . REPERTORY)),<br>
where ENCODING is a charset or a char-table,<br>
and REPERTORY is a charset, a char-table, or nil.<br>
<br>
If ENCODING and REPERTORY are the same, the element can have the form<br>
(REGEXP . ENCODING).<br>
<br>
ENCODING is for converting a character to a glyph code of the font.<br>
If ENCODING is a charset, encoding a character by the charset gives<br>
the corresponding glyph code.  If ENCODING is a char-table, looking up<br>
the table by a character gives the corresponding glyph code.<br>
<br>
REPERTORY specifies a repertory of characters supported by the font.<br>
If REPERTORY is a charset, all characters belonging to the charset are<br>
supported.  If REPERTORY is a char-table, all characters who have a<br>
non-nil value in the table are supported.  If REPERTORY is nil, Emacs
gets the repertory information by an opened font and ENCODING.</p>
