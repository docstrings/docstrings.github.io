<h3>Variable: kill-ring</h3>
<p>
List of killed text sequences.<br>
Since the kill ring is supposed to interact nicely with cut-and-paste<br>
facilities offered by window systems, use of this variable should<br>
interact nicely with `interprogram-cut-function' and<br>
`interprogram-paste-function'.  The functions `kill-new',<br>
`kill-append', and `current-kill' are supposed to implement this<br>
interaction; you may want to use them instead of manipulating the kill
ring directly.</p>
