<h3>Function: ucs-insert</h3>
<p>
Insert COUNT copies of CHARACTER.
Interactively, prompt for CHARACTER.  You can specify CHARACTER in one
of these ways:</p>
<p>
 - As its Unicode character name, e.g. "LATIN SMALL LETTER A".
   Completion is available; if you type a substring of the name
   preceded by an asterisk `*', Emacs shows all names which include
   that substring, not necessarily at the beginning of the name.</p>
<p>
 - As a hexadecimal code point, e.g. 263A.  Note that code points in
   Emacs are equivalent to Unicode up to 10FFFF (which is the limit of
   the Unicode code space).</p>
<p>
 - As a code point with a radix specified with #, e.g. #o21430
   (octal), #x2318 (hex), or #10r8984 (decimal).</p>
<p>
If called interactively, COUNT is given by the prefix argument.  If
omitted or nil, it defaults to 1.</p>
<p>
Inserting the character(s) relocates point and before-insertion
markers in the same ways as the function `insert'.</p>
<p>
The optional third argument INHERIT, if non-nil, says to inherit text
properties from adjoining text, if those properties are sticky.  If
called interactively, INHERIT is t.</p>
