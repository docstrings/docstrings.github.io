<h3>Function: edebug-defun</h3>
<p>
Evaluate the top level form point is in, stepping through with Edebug.
This is like `eval-defun' except that it steps the code for Edebug
before evaluating it.  It displays the value in the echo area
using `eval-expression' (which see).</p>
<p>
If you do this on a function definition such as a defun or defmacro,
it defines the function and instruments its definition for Edebug,
so it will do Edebug stepping when called later.  It displays
`Edebug: FUNCTION' in the echo area to indicate that FUNCTION is now
instrumented for Edebug.</p>
<p>
If the current defun is actually a call to `defvar' or `defcustom',
evaluating it this way resets the variable using its initial value
expression even if the variable already has some other value.
(Normally `defvar' and `defcustom' do not alter the value if there
already is one.)</p>
