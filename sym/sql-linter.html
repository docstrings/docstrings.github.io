<h3>Function: sql-linter</h3>
<p>
Run inl by RELEX as an inferior process.</p>
<p>
If buffer `*SQL*' exists but no process is running, make a new process.
If buffer exists and a process is running, just switch to buffer
`*SQL*'.</p>
<p>
Interpreter used comes from variable `sql-linter-program' - usually `inl'.
Login uses the variables `sql-user', `sql-password', `sql-database' and
`sql-server' as defaults, if set.  Additional command line parameters
can be stored in the list `sql-linter-options'.  Run inl -h to get help on
parameters.</p>
<p>
`sql-database' is used to set the LINTER_MBX environment variable for
local connections, `sql-server' refers to the server name from the
`nodetab' file for the network connection (dbc_tcp or friends must run
for this to work).  If `sql-password' is an empty string, inl will use
an empty password.</p>
<p>
The buffer is put in SQL interactive mode, giving commands for sending
input.  See `sql-interactive-mode'.</p>
<p>
To set the buffer name directly, use C-u
before M-x sql-linter.  Once session has started,
M-x sql-rename-buffer can be called separately to rename the
buffer.</p>
<p>
(Type C-h m in the SQL buffer for a list of commands.)</p>
<p>
(fn &optional BUFFER)</p>
