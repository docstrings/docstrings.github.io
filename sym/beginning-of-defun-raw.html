<h3>Function: beginning-of-defun-raw</h3>
<p>
Move point to the character that starts a defun.
This is identical to function `beginning-of-defun', except that point
does not move to the beginning of the line when `defun-prompt-regexp'
is non-nil.</p>
<p>
If variable `beginning-of-defun-function' is non-nil, its value
is called as a function to find the defun's beginning.</p>
