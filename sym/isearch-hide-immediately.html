<h3>Variable: isearch-hide-immediately</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, re-hide an invisible match right away.
This variable makes a difference when `search-invisible' is set to `open'.
It means that after search makes some invisible text visible
to show the match, it makes the text invisible again when the match moves.
Ordinarily the text becomes invisible again at the end of the search.</p>
