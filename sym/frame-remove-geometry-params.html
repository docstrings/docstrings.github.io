<h3>Function: frame-remove-geometry-params</h3>
<p>
Return the parameter list PARAM-LIST, but with geometry specs removed.
This deletes all bindings in PARAM-LIST for `top', `left', `width',
`height', `user-size' and `user-position' parameters.
Emacs uses this to avoid overriding explicit moves and resizings from
the user during startup.</p>
