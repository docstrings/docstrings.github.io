<h3>Variable: search-spaces-regexp</h3>
<p>
Regexp to substitute for bunches of spaces in regexp search.<br>
Some commands use this for user-specified regexps.<br>
Spaces that occur inside character classes or repetition operators<br>
or other such regexp constructs are not replaced with this.<br>
A value of nil (which is the normal value) means treat spaces literally.</p>
