<h3>Variable: search-spaces-regexp</h3>
<p>
Regexp to substitute for bunches of spaces in regexp search.
Some commands use this for user-specified regexps.
Spaces that occur inside character classes or repetition operators
or other such regexp constructs are not replaced with this.
A value of nil (which is the normal value) means treat spaces literally.</p>
