<h3>Variable: desktop-save-buffer</h3>
<p>
When non-nil, save buffer status in desktop file.
This variable becomes buffer local when set.</p>
<p>
If the value is a function, it is called by `desktop-save' with argument
DESKTOP-DIRNAME to obtain auxiliary information to save in the desktop
file along with the state of the buffer for which it was called.</p>
<p>
When file names are returned, they should be formatted using the call
"(desktop-file-name FILE-NAME DESKTOP-DIRNAME)".</p>
<p>
Later, when `desktop-read' evaluates the desktop file, auxiliary information
is passed as the argument DESKTOP-BUFFER-MISC to functions in
`desktop-buffer-mode-handlers'.</p>
