<h3>Variable: font-lock-global-modes</h3>
<p>
Modes for which Font Lock mode is automagically turned on.
Global Font Lock mode is controlled by the command `global-font-lock-mode'.
If nil, means no modes have Font Lock mode automatically turned on.
If t, all modes that support Font Lock mode have it automatically turned on.
If a list, it should be a list of `major-mode' symbol names for which Font Lock
mode should be automatically turned on.  The sense of the list is negated if it
begins with `not'.  For example:
 (c-mode c++-mode)
means that Font Lock mode is turned on for buffers in C and C++ modes only.</p>
