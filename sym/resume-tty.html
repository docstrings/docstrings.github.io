<h3>Function: resume-tty</h3>
<p>
Resume the previously suspended terminal device TTY.
The terminal is opened and reinitialized.  Frames that are on the
suspended terminal are revived.</p>
<p>
It is an error to resume a terminal while another terminal is active
on the same device.</p>
<p>
This function runs `resume-tty-functions' after resuming the terminal.
The functions are run with one arg, the id of the resumed terminal
device.</p>
<p>
`resume-tty' does nothing if it is called on a device that is not
suspended.</p>
<p>
TTY may be a terminal object, a frame, or nil (meaning the selected
frame's terminal).</p>
<p>
(fn &optional TTY)</p>
