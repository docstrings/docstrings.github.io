<h3>Function: yank</h3>
<p>
Reinsert ("paste") the last stretch of killed text.
More precisely, reinsert the most recent kill, which is the
stretch of killed text most recently killed OR yanked.  Put point
at the end, and set mark at the beginning without activating it.
With just C-u as argument, put point at beginning, and mark at end.
With argument N, reinsert the Nth most recent kill.</p>
<p>
When this command inserts text into the buffer, it honors the
`yank-handled-properties' and `yank-excluded-properties'
variables, and the `yank-handler' text property.  See
`insert-for-yank-1' for details.</p>

See also the command `yank-pop' (M-y).</p>
