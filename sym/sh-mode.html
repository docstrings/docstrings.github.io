<h3>Function: sh-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for editing shell scripts.
This mode works for many shells, since they all have roughly the same syntax,
as far as commands, arguments, variables, pipes, comments etc. are concerned.
Unless the file's magic number indicates the shell, your usual shell is
assumed.  Since filenames rarely give a clue, they are not further analyzed.</p>
<p>
This mode adapts to the variations between shells (see `sh-set-shell') by
means of an inheritance based feature lookup (see `sh-feature').  This
mechanism applies to all variables (including skeletons) that pertain to
shell-specific features.</p>
<p>
The default style of this mode is that of Rosenblatt's Korn shell book.
The syntax of the statements varies with the shell being used.  The
following commands are available, based on the current shell's syntax:</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `sh-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
M-x sh-case	 case statement
M-x sh-for	 for loop
M-x sh-function	 function definition
M-x sh-if	 if statement
M-x sh-indexed-loop	 indexed loop from 1 to n
M-x sh-while-getopts	 while getopts loop
M-x sh-repeat	 repeat loop
M-x sh-select	 select loop
M-x sh-until	 until loop
M-x sh-while	 while loop</p>
<p>
For sh and rc shells indentation commands are:
M-x sh-show-indent	Show the variable controlling this line's indentation.
M-x sh-set-indent	Set then variable controlling this line's indentation.
M-x sh-learn-line-indent	Change the indentation variable so this line
would indent to the way it currently is.
M-x sh-learn-buffer-indent  Set the indentation variables so the
buffer indents as it currently is indented.</p>
<p>

M-x backward-delete-char-untabify	 Delete backward one position, even if it was a tab.
C-j	 Delete unquoted space and indent new line same as this one.
M-x sh-end-of-command	 Go to end of successive commands.
M-x sh-beginning-of-command	 Go to beginning of successive commands.
M-x sh-set-shell	 Set this buffer's shell, and maybe its magic number.
M-x sh-execute-region	 Have optional header and region be executed in a subshell.</p>
<p>
`sh-electric-here-document-mode' controls whether insertion of two
unquoted < insert a here document.</p>
<p>
If you generally program a shell different from your login shell you can
set `sh-shell-file' accordingly.  If your shell's file name doesn't correctly
indicate what shell it is use `sh-alias-alist' to translate.</p>
<p>
If your shell gives error messages with line numbers, you can use M-x executable-interpret
with your script for an edit-interpret-debug cycle.</p>
