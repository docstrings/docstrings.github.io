<h3>Function: match-data</h3>
<p>
Return a list containing all info on what the last search matched.
Element 2N is `(match-beginning N)'; element 2N + 1 is `(match-end N)'.
All the elements are markers or nil (nil if the Nth pair didn't match)
if the last match was on a buffer; integers or nil if a string was matched.
Use `set-match-data' to reinstate the data in this list.</p>
<p>
If INTEGERS (the optional first argument) is non-nil, always use
integers (rather than markers) to represent buffer positions.  In
this case, and if the last match was in a buffer, the buffer will get
stored as one additional element at the end of the list.</p>
<p>
If REUSE is a list, reuse it as part of the value.  If REUSE is long
enough to hold all the values, and if INTEGERS is non-nil, no consing
is done.</p>
<p>
If optional third arg RESEAT is non-nil, any previous markers on the
REUSE list will be modified to point to nowhere.</p>
<p>
Return value is undefined if the last search failed.</p>
