<h3>Function: file-chase-links</h3>
<p>
Chase links in FILENAME until a name that is not a link.<br>
Unlike `file-truename', this does not check whether a parent<br>
directory name is a symbolic link.<br>
If the optional argument LIMIT is a number,<br>
it means chase no more than that many links and then stop.</p>
