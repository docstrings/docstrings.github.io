<h3>Function: list-holidays</h3>
<p>
Display holidays for years Y1 to Y2 (inclusive).
Y2 defaults to Y1.  The optional list of holidays L defaults to
`calendar-holidays'.  If you want to control what holidays are
displayed, use a different list.  For example,</p>
<p>
  (list-holidays 2006 2006
    (append holiday-general-holidays holiday-local-holidays))</p>
<p>
will display holidays for the year 2006 defined in the two
mentioned lists, and nothing else.</p>
<p>
When called interactively, this command offers a choice of
holidays, based on the variables `holiday-solar-holidays' etc.  See the
documentation of `calendar-holidays' for a list of the variables
that control the choices, as well as a description of the format
of a holiday list.</p>
<p>
The optional LABEL is used to label the buffer created.</p>
