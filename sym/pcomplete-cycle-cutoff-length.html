<h3>Variable: pcomplete-cycle-cutoff-length</h3>
<p>
If the number of completions is greater than this, don't cycle.<br>
This variable is a compromise between the traditional Emacs style of<br>
completion, and the "cycling" style.  Basically, if there are more<br>
than this number of completions possible, don't automatically pick the<br>
first one and then expect the user to press TAB to cycle through them.<br>
Typically, when there are a large number of completion possibilities,<br>
the user wants to see them in a list buffer so that they can know what<br>
options are available.  But if the list is small, it means the user<br>
has already entered enough input to disambiguate most of the<br>
possibilities, and therefore they are probably most interested in<br>
cycling through the candidates.  Set this value to nil if you want
cycling to always be enabled.</p>
