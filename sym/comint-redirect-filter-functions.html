<h3>Variable: comint-redirect-filter-functions</h3>
<p>
List of functions to call before inserting redirected process output.<br>
Each function gets one argument, a string containing the text received<br>
from the subprocess.  It should return the string to insert, perhaps<br>
the same string that was received, or perhaps a modified or transformed<br>
string.<br>
<br>
The functions on the list are called sequentially, and each one is given<br>
the string returned by the previous one.  The string returned by the<br>
last function is the text that is actually inserted in the redirection buffer.<br>
<br>
You can use `add-hook' to add functions to this list
either globally or locally.</p>
