<h3>Function: rst-minor-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle ReST minor mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable ReST minor mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When ReST minor mode is enabled, the ReST mode keybindings
are installed on top of the major mode bindings.  Use this
for modes derived from Text mode, like Mail mode.</p>
