<h3>Function: bidi-string-mark-left-to-right</h3>
<p>
Return a string that can be safely inserted in left-to-right text.</p>
<p>
Normally, inserting a string with right-to-left (RTL) script into
a buffer may cause some subsequent text to be displayed as part
of the RTL segment (usually this affects punctuation characters).
This function returns a string which displays as STR but forces
subsequent text to be displayed as left-to-right.</p>
<p>
If STR contains any RTL character, this function returns a string
consisting of STR followed by an invisible left-to-right mark
(LRM) character.  Otherwise, it returns STR.</p>
