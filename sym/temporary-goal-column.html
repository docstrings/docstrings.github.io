<h3>Variable: temporary-goal-column</h3>
<p>
Current goal column for vertical motion.
It is the column where point was at the start of the current run
of vertical motion commands.</p>
<p>
When moving by visual lines via `line-move-visual', it is a cons
cell (COL . HSCROLL), where COL is the x-position, in pixels,
divided by the default column width, and HSCROLL is the number of
columns by which window is scrolled from left margin.</p>
<p>
When the `track-eol' feature is doing its job, the value is
`most-positive-fixnum'.</p>
