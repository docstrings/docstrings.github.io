<h3>Function: standard-display-cyrillic-translit</h3>
<p>
Display a cyrillic buffer using a transliteration.
For readability, the table is slightly
different from the one used for the input method `cyrillic-translit'.</p>
<p>
The argument is a string which specifies which language you are using;
that affects the choice of transliterations slightly.
Possible values are listed in `cyrillic-language-alist'.
If the argument is t, we use the default cyrillic transliteration.
If the argument is nil, we return the display table to its standard state.</p>
