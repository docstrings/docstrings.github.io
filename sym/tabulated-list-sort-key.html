<h3>Variable: tabulated-list-sort-key</h3>
<p>
Sort key for the current Tabulated List mode buffer.<br>
If nil, no additional sorting is performed.<br>
Otherwise, this should be a cons cell (NAME . FLIP).<br>
NAME is a string matching one of the column names in<br>
`tabulated-list-format' (the corresponding SORT entry in<br>
`tabulated-list-format' then specifies how to sort).  FLIP, if<br>
non-nil, means to invert the resulting sort.</p>
