<h3>Function: create-file-buffer</h3>
<p>
Create a suitably named buffer for visiting FILENAME, and return it.
FILENAME (sans directory) is used unchanged if that name is free;
otherwise a string <2> or <3> or ... is appended to get an unused name.
Spaces at the start of FILENAME (sans directory) are removed.</p>
