<h3>Variable: before-change-functions</h3>
<p>
List of functions to call before each text change.<br>
Two arguments are passed to each function: the positions of<br>
the beginning and end of the range of old text to be changed.<br>
(For an insertion, the beginning and end are at the same place.)<br>
No information is given about the length of the text after the change.<br>
<br>
Buffer changes made while executing the `before-change-functions'<br>
don't call any before-change or after-change functions.<br>
That's because `inhibit-modification-hooks' is temporarily set non-nil.<br>
<br>
If an unhandled error happens in running these functions,<br>
the variable's value remains nil.  That prevents the error<br>
from happening repeatedly and making Emacs nonfunctional.</p>
