<h3>Function: string-to-int</h3>
<p>
Parse STRING as a decimal number and return the number.
This parses both integers and floating point numbers.
It ignores leading spaces and tabs, and all trailing chars.</p>
<p>
If BASE, interpret STRING as a number in that base.  If BASE isn't
present, base 10 is used.  BASE must be between 2 and 16 (inclusive).
If the base used is not 10, STRING is always parsed as integer.</p>
