<h3>Function: sentence-end</h3>
<p>
Return the regexp describing the end of a sentence.<br>
<br>
This function returns either the value of the variable `sentence-end'<br>
if it is non-nil, or the default value constructed from the<br>
variables `sentence-end-base', `sentence-end-double-space',<br>
`sentence-end-without-period' and `sentence-end-without-space'.<br>
<br>
The default value specifies that in order to be recognized as the<br>
end of a sentence, the ending period, question mark, or exclamation point<br>
must be followed by two spaces, with perhaps some closing delimiters<br>
in between.  See Info node `(elisp)Standard Regexps'.</p>
<h3>Variable: sentence-end</h3>
<p>
Regexp describing the end of a sentence.<br>
The value includes the whitespace following the sentence.<br>
All paragraph boundaries also end sentences, regardless.<br>
<br>
The value nil means to use the default value defined by the<br>
function `sentence-end'.  You should always use this function<br>
to obtain the value of this variable.</p>
