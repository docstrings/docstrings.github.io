<h3>Function: view-mode-exit</h3>
<p>
Exit View mode in various ways.
If all arguments are nil, remove the current buffer from the
selected window using the `quit-restore' information associated
with the selected window.  If optional argument ALL-WINDOWS or
`view-exits-all-viewing-windows' are non-nil, remove the current
buffer from all windows showing it.</p>
<p>
Optional argument EXIT-ONLY non-nil means just exit `view-mode'
(unless `view-no-disable-on-exit' is non-nil) but do not change
the associations of any windows with the current buffer.</p>
<p>
EXIT-ACTION, if non-nil, must specify a function that is called
with the current buffer as argument and is called after disabling
`view-mode' and removing any associations of windows with the
current buffer. </p>
