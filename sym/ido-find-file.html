<h3>Function: ido-find-file</h3>
<p>
Edit file with name obtained via minibuffer.
The file is displayed according to `ido-default-file-method' -- the
default is to show it in the same window, unless it is already
visible in another frame.</p>
<p>
The file name is selected interactively by typing a substring.  As you
type in a string, all of the filenames matching the string are displayed
if substring-matching is used (default).  Look at `ido-enable-prefix' and
`ido-toggle-prefix'.  When you have found the filename you want, it can
then be selected.  As you type, most keys have their normal keybindings,
except for the following: 
Uses keymap `ido-file-completion-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
