<h3>Function: split-string</h3>
<p>
Split STRING into substrings bounded by matches for SEPARATORS.</p>
<p>
The beginning and end of STRING, and each match for SEPARATORS, are
splitting points.  The substrings matching SEPARATORS are removed, and
the substrings between the splitting points are collected as a list,
which is returned.</p>
<p>
If SEPARATORS is non-nil, it should be a regular expression matching text
which separates, but is not part of, the substrings.  If nil it defaults to
`split-string-default-separators', normally "[ \f\t\n\r\v]+", and
OMIT-NULLS is forced to t.</p>
<p>
If OMIT-NULLS is t, zero-length substrings are omitted from the list (so
that for the default value of SEPARATORS leading and trailing whitespace
are effectively trimmed).  If nil, all zero-length substrings are retained,
which correctly parses CSV format, for example.</p>
<p>
Note that the effect of `(split-string STRING)' is the same as
`(split-string STRING split-string-default-separators t)'.  In the rare
case that you wish to retain zero-length substrings when splitting on
whitespace, use `(split-string STRING split-string-default-separators)'.</p>
<p>
Modifies the match data; use `save-match-data' if necessary.</p>
