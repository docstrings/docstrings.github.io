<h3>Function: pr-despool-preview</h3>
<p>
Preview spooled PostScript.</p>
<p>
Interactively, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the
user for a file name, and saves the spooled PostScript image in that file
instead of saving it in a temporary file.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, the argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it is nil,
save the image in a temporary file.  If FILENAME is a string, save the
PostScript image in a file with that name.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FILENAME)</p>
