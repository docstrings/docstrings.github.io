<h3>Variable: shell-dumb-shell-regexp</h3>
<p>
Regexp to match shells that don't save their command history, and<br>
don't handle the backslash as a quote character.  For shells that<br>
match this regexp, Emacs will write out the command history when the<br>
shell finishes, and won't remove backslashes when it unquotes shell
arguments.</p>
