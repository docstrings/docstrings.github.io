<h3>Variable: buffer-invisibility-spec</h3>
<p>
Invisibility spec of this buffer.<br>
The default is t, which means that text is invisible<br>
if it has a non-nil `invisible' property.<br>
If the value is a list, a text character is invisible if its `invisible'<br>
property is an element in that list (or is a list with members in common).<br>
If an element is a cons cell of the form (PROP . ELLIPSIS),<br>
then characters with property value PROP are invisible,<br>
and they have an ellipsis as well if ELLIPSIS is non-nil.</p>
