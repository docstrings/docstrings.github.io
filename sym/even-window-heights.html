<h3>Variable: even-window-heights</h3>
<p>
If non-nil `display-buffer' will try to even window heights.<br>
Otherwise `display-buffer' will leave the window configuration<br>
alone.  Heights are evened only when `display-buffer' chooses a<br>
window that appears above or below the selected window.</p>
