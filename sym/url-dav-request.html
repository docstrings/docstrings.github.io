<h3>Function: url-dav-request</h3>

DEPTH is how deep the request should propagate.  Default is 0, meaning
it should apply only to URL.  A negative number means to use
`Infinity' for the depth.  Not all WebDAV servers support this depth
though.</p>
<p>
HEADERS is an assoc list of extra headers to send in the request.</p>

NAMESPACES is an assoc list of (NAMESPACE . EXPANSION), and these are
