<h3>Function: x-own-selection-internal</h3>
<p>
Assert an X selection of the type SELECTION with and value VALUE.
SELECTION is a symbol, typically `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', or `CLIPBOARD'.
(Those are literal upper-case symbol names, since that's what X expects.)
VALUE is typically a string, or a cons of two markers, but may be
anything that the functions on `selection-converter-alist' know about.</p>
<p>
FRAME should be a frame that should own the selection.  If omitted or
nil, it defaults to the selected frame.</p>
<p>
On Nextstep, FRAME is unused.</p>
<p>
(fn SELECTION VALUE &optional FRAME)</p>
