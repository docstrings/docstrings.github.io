<h3>Variable: disable-point-adjustment</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, suppress point adjustment after executing a command.</p>
<p>
After a command is executed, if point is moved into a region that has
special properties (e.g. composition, display), we adjust point to
the boundary of the region.  But, when a command sets this variable to
non-nil, we suppress the point adjustment.</p>
<p>
This variable is set to nil before reading a command, and is checked
just after executing the command.</p>
