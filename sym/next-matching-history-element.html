<h3>Function: next-matching-history-element</h3>
<p>
Find the next history element that matches REGEXP.<br>
(The next history element refers to a more recent action.)<br>
With prefix argument N, search for Nth next match.<br>
If N is negative, find the previous or Nth previous match.<br>
Normally, history elements are matched case-insensitively if<br>
`case-fold-search' is non-nil, but an uppercase letter in REGEXP<br>
makes the search case-sensitive.</p>
