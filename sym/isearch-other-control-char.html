<h3>Function: isearch-other-control-char</h3>
<p>
Process a miscellaneous key sequence in Isearch mode.</p>
<p>
Try to convert the current key-sequence to something usable in Isearch
mode, either by converting it with `function-key-map', downcasing a
key with C-<upper case>, or finding a "scrolling command" bound to
it.  (In the last case, we may have to read more events.)  If so,
either unread the converted sequence or execute the command.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, if `search-exit-option' is non-nil (the default) unread the
key-sequence and exit the search normally.  If it is the symbol
`edit', the search string is edited in the minibuffer and the meta
character is unread so that it applies to editing the string.</p>
<p>
ARG is the prefix argument.  It will be transmitted through to the
scrolling command or to the command whose key-sequence exits
Isearch mode.</p>
