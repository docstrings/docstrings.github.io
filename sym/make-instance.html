<h3>Function: make-instance</h3>
<p>
Make a new instance of CLASS based on INITARGS.
CLASS is a class symbol.  For example:</p>
<p>
  (make-instance 'foo)</p>
<p>
  INITARGS is a property list with keywords based on the :initarg
for each slot.  For example:</p>
<p>
  (make-instance 'foo :slot1 value1 :slotN valueN)</p>
<p>
Compatibility note:</p>
<p>
If the first element of INITARGS is a string, it is used as the
name of the class.</p>
<p>
In EIEIO, the class' constructor requires a name for use when printing.
`make-instance' in CLOS doesn't use names the way Emacs does, so the
class is used as the name slot instead when INITARGS doesn't start with
a string.</p>
