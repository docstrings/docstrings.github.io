<h3>Function: spam-initialize</h3>
<p>
Install the spam.el hooks and do other initialization.<br>
When SYMBOLS is given, set those variables to t.  This is so you<br>
can call `spam-initialize' before you set spam-use-* variables on<br>
explicitly, and matters only if you need the extra headers<br>
installed through `spam-necessary-extra-headers'.<br>
