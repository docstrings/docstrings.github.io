<h3>Function: spam-initialize</h3>
<p>
Install the spam.el hooks and do other initialization.
When SYMBOLS is given, set those variables to t.  This is so you
can call `spam-initialize' before you set spam-use-* variables on
explicitly, and matters only if you need the extra headers
installed through `spam-necessary-extra-headers'.</p>
