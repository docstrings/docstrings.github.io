<h3>Function: call-process</h3>
<p>
Call PROGRAM synchronously in separate process.
The remaining arguments are optional.
The program's input comes from file INFILE (nil means `/dev/null').
Insert output in BUFFER before point; t means current buffer; nil for BUFFER
 means discard it; 0 means discard and don't wait; and `(:file FILE)', where
 FILE is a file name string, means that it should be written to that file
 (if the file already exists it is overwritten).
BUFFER can also have the form (REAL-BUFFER STDERR-FILE); in that case,
REAL-BUFFER says what to do with standard output, as above,
while STDERR-FILE says what to do with standard error in the child.
STDERR-FILE may be nil (discard standard error output),
t (mix it with ordinary output), or a file name string.</p>
<p>
Fourth arg DISPLAY non-nil means redisplay buffer as output is inserted.
Remaining arguments are strings passed as command arguments to PROGRAM.</p>
<p>
If executable PROGRAM can't be found as an executable, `call-process'
signals a Lisp error.  `call-process' reports errors in execution of
the program only through its return and output.</p>
<p>
If BUFFER is 0, `call-process' returns immediately with value nil.
Otherwise it waits for PROGRAM to terminate
and returns a numeric exit status or a signal description string.
If you quit, the process is killed with SIGINT, or SIGKILL if you quit again.</p>
