<h3>Function: dired</h3>
<p>
"Edit" directory DIRNAME--delete, rename, print, etc. some files in it.<br>
Optional second argument SWITCHES specifies the `ls' options used.<br>
(Interactively, use a prefix argument to be able to specify SWITCHES.)<br>
Dired displays a list of files in DIRNAME (which may also have<br>
shell wildcards appended to select certain files).  If DIRNAME is a cons,<br>
its first element is taken as the directory name and the rest as an explicit<br>
list of files to make directory entries for.<br>
<br>
Uses keymap `dired-mode-map', which is not currently defined.<br>
You can flag files for deletion with M-x dired-flag-file-deletion and then<br>
delete them by typing M-x dired-do-flagged-delete.<br>
Type C-h m after entering Dired for more info.<br>
<br>
If DIRNAME is already in a dired buffer, that buffer is used without refresh.
