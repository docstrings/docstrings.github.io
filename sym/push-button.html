<h3>Function: push-button</h3>
<p>
Perform the action specified by a button at location POS.
POS may be either a buffer position or a mouse-event.  If
USE-MOUSE-ACTION is non-nil, invoke the button's mouse-action
instead of its normal action; if the button has no mouse-action,
the normal action is used instead.  The action may be either a
function to call or a marker to display.
POS defaults to point, except when `push-button' is invoked
interactively as the result of a mouse-event, in which case, the
mouse event is used.
If there's no button at POS, do nothing and return nil, otherwise
return t.</p>
