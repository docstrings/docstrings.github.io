<h3>Function: end-of-buffer</h3>
<p>
Move point to the end of the buffer.<br>
With numeric arg N, put point N/10 of the way from the end.<br>
If the buffer is narrowed, this command uses the end of the<br>
accessible part of the buffer.<br>
<br>
If Transient Mark mode is disabled, leave mark at previous<br>
position, unless a C-u prefix is supplied.<br>
<br>
Don't use this command in Lisp programs!<br>
(goto-char (point-max)) is faster.</p>
