<h3>Function: show-buffer</h3>
<p>
Make WINDOW display BUFFER-OR-NAME as its contents.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.
BUFFER-OR-NAME must be a buffer or the name of an existing buffer.</p>
<p>
Optional third argument KEEP-MARGINS non-nil means that WINDOW's current
display margins, fringe widths, and scroll bar settings are preserved;
the default is to reset these from the local settings for BUFFER-OR-NAME
or the frame defaults.  Return nil.</p>
<p>
This function throws an error when WINDOW is strongly dedicated to its
buffer (that is `window-dedicated-p' returns t for WINDOW) and does not
already display BUFFER-OR-NAME.</p>
<p>
This function runs `window-scroll-functions' before running
`window-configuration-change-hook'.</p>
<p>
(fn WINDOW BUFFER-OR-NAME &optional KEEP-MARGINS)</p>
