<h3>Function: field-end</h3>
<p>
Return the end of the field surrounding POS.<br>
A field is a region of text with the same `field' property.<br>
If POS is nil, the value of point is used for POS.<br>
If ESCAPE-FROM-EDGE is non-nil and POS is at the end of its field,<br>
then the end of the *following* field is returned.<br>
If LIMIT is non-nil, it is a buffer position; if the end of the field<br>
is after LIMIT, then LIMIT will be returned instead.<br>
