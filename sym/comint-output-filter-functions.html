<h3>Variable: comint-output-filter-functions</h3>
<p>
Functions to call after output is inserted into the buffer.
One possible function is `comint-postoutput-scroll-to-bottom'.
These functions get one argument, a string containing the text as originally
inserted.  Note that this might not be the same as the buffer contents between
`comint-last-output-start' and the buffer's `process-mark', if other filter
functions have already modified the buffer.</p>
<p>
See also `comint-preoutput-filter-functions'.</p>
<p>
You can use `add-hook' to add functions to this list
either globally or locally.</p>
