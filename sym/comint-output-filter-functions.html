<h3>Variable: comint-output-filter-functions</h3>
<p>
Functions to call after output is inserted into the buffer.<br>
One possible function is `comint-postoutput-scroll-to-bottom'.<br>
These functions get one argument, a string containing the text as originally<br>
inserted.  Note that this might not be the same as the buffer contents between<br>
`comint-last-output-start' and the buffer's `process-mark', if other filter<br>
functions have already modified the buffer.<br>
<br>
See also `comint-preoutput-filter-functions'.<br>
<br>
You can use `add-hook' to add functions to this list
either globally or locally.</p>
