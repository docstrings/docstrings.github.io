<h3>Function: set-window-buffer-start-and-point</h3>
<p>
Set WINDOW's buffer to BUFFER.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.
Optional argument START non-nil means set WINDOW's start position
to START.  Optional argument POINT non-nil means set WINDOW's
point to POINT.  If WINDOW is selected this also sets BUFFER's
`point' to POINT.  If WINDOW is selected and the buffer it showed
before was current this also makes BUFFER the current buffer.</p>
