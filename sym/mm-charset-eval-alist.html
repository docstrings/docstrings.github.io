<h3>Variable: mm-charset-eval-alist</h3>
<p>
An alist of (CHARSET . FORM) pairs.
If an article is encoded in an unknown CHARSET, FORM is
evaluated.  This allows to load additional libraries providing
charsets on demand.  If supported by your Emacs version, you
could use `autoload-coding-system' here.</p>
