<h3>Function: eieio-generic-call-primary-only</h3>
<p>
Call METHOD with ARGS for methods with only :PRIMARY implementations.<br>
ARGS provides the context on which implementation to use.<br>
This should only be called from a generic function.<br>
<br>
This method is like `eieio-generic-call', but only<br>
implementations in the :PRIMARY slot are queried.  After many<br>
years of use, it appears that over 90% of methods in use<br>
have :PRIMARY implementations only.  We can therefore optimize<br>
for this common case to improve performance.</p>
