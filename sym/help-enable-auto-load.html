<h3>Variable: help-enable-auto-load</h3>
<p>
Whether Help commands can perform autoloading.
If non-nil, whenever C-h f is called for an
autoloaded function whose docstring contains any key substitution
construct (see `substitute-command-keys'), the library is loaded,
so that the documentation can show the right key bindings.</p>
