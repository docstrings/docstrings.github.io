<h3>Function: use-hard-newlines</h3>
<p>
Toggle distinguishing between hard and soft newlines.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable the feature if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
it if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When enabled, the functions `newline' and `open-line' add the
text-property `hard' to newlines that they insert, and a line is
only considered as a candidate to match `paragraph-start' or
`paragraph-separate' if it follows a hard newline.</p>
<p>
When enabling, if there are newlines in the buffer but no hard
newlines, ask the user whether to mark as hard any newlines
preceding a `paragraph-start' line.  From a program, second arg
INSERT specifies whether to do this; it can be `never' to change
nothing, t or `always' to force marking, `guess' to try to do the
right thing with no questions, nil or anything else to ask the
user.</p>
<p>
Newlines not marked hard are called "soft", and are always internal
to paragraphs.  The fill functions insert and delete only soft newlines.</p>
<h3>Variable: use-hard-newlines</h3>
<p>
Non-nil if Use-Hard-Newlines mode is enabled.
Use the command `use-hard-newlines' to change this variable.</p>
