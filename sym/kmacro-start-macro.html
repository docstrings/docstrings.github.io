<h3>Function: kmacro-start-macro</h3>
<p>
Record subsequent keyboard input, defining a keyboard macro.<br>
The commands are recorded even as they are executed.<br>
Use C-x ) to finish recording and make the macro available.<br>

<br>
Non-nil arg (prefix arg) means append to last macro defined.<br>

With C-u prefix, append to last keyboard macro<br>
defined.  Depending on `kmacro-execute-before-append', this may begin<br>
by re-executing the last macro as if you typed it again.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, it sets `kmacro-counter' to ARG or 0 if missing before<br>
defining the macro.<br>
<br>
Use M-x kmacro-insert-counter to insert (and increment) the macro counter.<br>
The counter value can be set or modified via M-x kmacro-set-counter and M-x kmacro-add-counter.<br>
The format of the counter can be modified via M-x kmacro-set-format.<br>
<br>
Use M-x kmacro-name-last-macro to give it a permanent name.
