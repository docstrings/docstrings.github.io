<h3>Function: comint-accumulate</h3>
<p>
Accumulate a line to send as input along with more lines.
This inserts a newline so that you can enter more text
to be sent along with this line.  Use M-x comint-send-input
to send all the accumulated input, at once.
The entire accumulated text becomes one item in the input history
when you send it.</p>
