<h3>Variable: input-decode-map</h3>
<p>
Keymap that decodes input escape sequences.<br>
This is used mainly for mapping ASCII function key sequences into<br>
real Emacs function key events (symbols).<br>
<br>
The `read-key-sequence' function replaces any subsequence bound by<br>
`input-decode-map' with its binding.  Contrary to `function-key-map',<br>
this map applies its rebinding regardless of the presence of an ordinary<br>
binding.  So it is more like `key-translation-map' except that it applies<br>
before `function-key-map' rather than after.<br>
<br>
If the binding is a function, it is called with one argument (the prompt)<br>
and its return value (a key sequence) is used.<br>
<br>
The events that come from bindings in `input-decode-map' are not
themselves looked up in `input-decode-map'.</p>
