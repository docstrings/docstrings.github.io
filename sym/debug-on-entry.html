<h3>Function: debug-on-entry</h3>
<p>
Request FUNCTION to invoke debugger each time it is called.</p>
<p>
When called interactively, prompt for FUNCTION in the minibuffer.</p>
<p>
This works by modifying the definition of FUNCTION.  If you tell the
debugger to continue, FUNCTION's execution proceeds.  If FUNCTION is a
normal function or a macro written in Lisp, you can also step through
its execution.  FUNCTION can also be a primitive that is not a special
form, in which case stepping is not possible.  Break-on-entry for
primitive functions only works when that function is called from Lisp.</p>
<p>
Use M-x cancel-debug-on-entry to cancel the effect of this command.
Redefining FUNCTION also cancels it.</p>
