<h3>Variable: auto-resize-tool-bars</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means automatically resize tool-bars.<br>
This dynamically changes the tool-bar's height to the minimum height<br>
that is needed to make all tool-bar items visible.<br>
If value is `grow-only', the tool-bar's height is only increased<br>
automatically; to decrease the tool-bar height, use M-x recenter.</p>
