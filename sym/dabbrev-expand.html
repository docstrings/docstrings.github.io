<h3>Function: dabbrev-expand</h3>
<p>
Expand previous word "dynamically".</p>
<p>
Expands to the most recent, preceding word for which this is a prefix.
If no suitable preceding word is found, words following point are
considered.  If still no suitable word is found, then look in the
buffers accepted by the function pointed out by variable
`dabbrev-friend-buffer-function'.</p>
<p>
A positive prefix argument, N, says to take the Nth backward *distinct*
possibility.  A negative argument says search forward.</p>
<p>
If the cursor has not moved from the end of the previous expansion and
no argument is given, replace the previously-made expansion
with the next possible expansion not yet tried.</p>
<p>
The variable `dabbrev-backward-only' may be used to limit the
direction of search to backward if set non-nil.</p>
