<h3>Function: dabbrev-expand</h3>
<p>
Expand previous word "dynamically".<br>
<br>
Expands to the most recent, preceding word for which this is a prefix.<br>
If no suitable preceding word is found, words following point are<br>
considered.  If still no suitable word is found, then look in the<br>
buffers accepted by the function pointed out by variable<br>
`dabbrev-friend-buffer-function'.<br>
<br>
A positive prefix argument, N, says to take the Nth backward *distinct*<br>
possibility.  A negative argument says search forward.<br>
<br>
If the cursor has not moved from the end of the previous expansion and<br>
no argument is given, replace the previously-made expansion<br>
with the next possible expansion not yet tried.<br>
<br>
The variable `dabbrev-backward-only' may be used to limit the<br>
direction of search to backward if set non-nil.
