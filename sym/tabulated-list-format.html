<h3>Variable: tabulated-list-format</h3>
<p>
The format of the current Tabulated List mode buffer.
This should be a vector of elements (NAME WIDTH SORT . PROPS),
where:
 - NAME is a string describing the column.
   This is the label for the column in the header line.
   Different columns must have non-`equal' names.
 - WIDTH is the width to reserve for the column.
   For the final element, its numerical value is ignored.
 - SORT specifies how to sort entries by this column.
   If nil, this column cannot be used for sorting.
   If t, sort by comparing the string value printed in the column.
   Otherwise, it should be a predicate function suitable for
   `sort', accepting arguments with the same form as the elements
   of `tabulated-list-entries'.
 - PROPS is a plist of additional column properties.
   Currently supported properties are:
   - `:right-align': if non-nil, the column should be right-aligned.
   - `:pad-right': Number of additional padding spaces to the
     right of the column (defaults to 1 if omitted).</p>
