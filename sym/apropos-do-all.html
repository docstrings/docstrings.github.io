<h3>Variable: apropos-do-all</h3>
<p>
Non nil means apropos commands will search more extensively.
This may be slower.  This option affects the following commands:</p>
<p>
`apropos-variable' will search all variables, not just user variables.
`apropos-command' will also search non-interactive functions.
`apropos' will search all symbols, not just functions, variables, faces,
and those with property lists.
`apropos-value' will also search in property lists and functions.
`apropos-documentation' will search all documentation strings, not just
those in the etc/DOC documentation file.</p>
<p>
This option only controls the default behavior.  Each of the above
commands also has an optional argument to request a more extensive search.</p>
<p>
Additionally, this option makes the function `apropos-library'
include key-binding information in its output.</p>
