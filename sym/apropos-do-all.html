<h3>Variable: apropos-do-all</h3>
<p>
Non nil means apropos commands will search more extensively.<br>
This may be slower.  This option affects the following commands:<br>
<br>
`apropos-variable' will search all variables, not just user variables.<br>
`apropos-command' will also search non-interactive functions.<br>
`apropos' will search all symbols, not just functions, variables, faces,<br>
and those with property lists.<br>
`apropos-value' will also search in property lists and functions.<br>
`apropos-documentation' will search all documentation strings, not just<br>
those in the etc/DOC documentation file.<br>
<br>
This option only controls the default behavior.  Each of the above<br>
commands also has an optional argument to request a more extensive search.<br>
<br>
Additionally, this option makes the function `apropos-library'
include key-binding information in its output.</p>
