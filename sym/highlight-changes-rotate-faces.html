<h3>Function: highlight-changes-rotate-faces</h3>
<p>
Rotate the faces if in Highlight Changes mode and the changes are visible.</p>
<p>
Current changes are displayed in the face described by the first element
of `highlight-changes-face-list', one level older changes are shown in
face described by the second element, and so on.  Very old changes remain
shown in the last face in the list.</p>
<p>
You can automatically rotate colors when the buffer is saved by adding
this function to `write-file-functions' as a buffer-local value.  To do
this, eval the following in the buffer to be saved:</p>
<p>
  (add-hook 'write-file-functions 'highlight-changes-rotate-faces nil t)</p>
<p>
(fn)</p>
