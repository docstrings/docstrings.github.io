<h3>Variable: delete-by-moving-to-trash</h3>
<p>
Specifies whether to use the system's trash can.
When non-nil, certain file deletion commands use the function
`move-file-to-trash' instead of deleting files outright.
This includes interactive calls to `delete-file' and
`delete-directory' and the Dired deletion commands.</p>
