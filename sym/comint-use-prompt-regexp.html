<h3>Variable: comint-use-prompt-regexp</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, use `comint-prompt-regexp' to recognize prompts.
If nil, then program output and user-input are given different `field'
properties, which Emacs commands can use to distinguish them (in
particular, common movement commands such as `beginning-of-line'
respect field boundaries in a natural way).</p>
