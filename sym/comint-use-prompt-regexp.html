<h3>Variable: comint-use-prompt-regexp</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, use `comint-prompt-regexp' to recognize prompts.<br>
If nil, then program output and user-input are given different `field'<br>
properties, which Emacs commands can use to distinguish them (in<br>
particular, common movement commands such as `beginning-of-line'<br>
respect field boundaries in a natural way).</p>
