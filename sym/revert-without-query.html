<h3>Variable: revert-without-query</h3>
<p>
Specify which files should be reverted without query.
The value is a list of regular expressions.
If the file name matches one of these regular expressions,
then `revert-buffer' reverts the file without querying
if the file has changed on disk and you have not edited the buffer.</p>
