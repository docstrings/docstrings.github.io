<h3>Function: object-assoc</h3>
<p>
Return an object if KEY is `equal' to SLOT's value of an object in LIST.
LIST is a list of objects whose slots are searched.
Objects in LIST do not need to have a slot named SLOT, nor does
SLOT need to be bound.  If these errors occur, those objects will
be ignored.</p>
