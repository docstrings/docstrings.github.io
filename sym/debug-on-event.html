<h3>Variable: debug-on-event</h3>
<p>
Enter debugger on this event.  When Emacs<br>
receives the special event specified by this variable, it will try to<br>
break into the debugger as soon as possible instead of processing the<br>
event normally through `special-event-map'.<br>
<br>
Currently, the only supported values for this<br>
variable are `sigusr1' and `sigusr2'.</p>
