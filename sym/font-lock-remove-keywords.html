<h3>Function: font-lock-remove-keywords</h3>
<p>
Remove highlighting KEYWORDS for MODE.</p>
<p>
MODE should be a symbol, the major mode command name, such as `c-mode'
or nil.  If nil, highlighting keywords are removed for the current buffer.</p>
<p>
To make the removal apply to modes derived from MODE as well,
pass nil for MODE and add the call to MODE-hook.  This may fail
for some derived modes if some involved major mode does not
follow the standard conventions.  File a bug report if this
happens, so the major mode can be corrected.</p>
