<h3>Function: select-message-coding-system</h3>

Return a coding system to encode the outgoing message of the current buffer.
It at first tries the first coding system found in these variables
in this order:
  (1) local value of `buffer-file-coding-system'
  (2) value of `sendmail-coding-system'
  (3) value of `default-sendmail-coding-system'
