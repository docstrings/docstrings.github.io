<h3>Function: window-resize</h3>
<p>
Resize WINDOW vertically by DELTA lines.
WINDOW can be an arbitrary window and defaults to the selected
one.  An attempt to resize the root window of a frame will raise
an error though.</p>
<p>
DELTA a positive number means WINDOW shall be enlarged by DELTA
lines.  DELTA negative means WINDOW shall be shrunk by -DELTA
lines.</p>
<p>
Optional argument HORIZONTAL non-nil means resize WINDOW
horizontally by DELTA columns.  In this case a positive DELTA
means enlarge WINDOW by DELTA columns.  DELTA negative means
WINDOW shall be shrunk by -DELTA columns.</p>
<p>
Optional argument IGNORE non-nil means ignore restrictions
imposed by fixed size windows, `window-min-height' or
`window-min-width' settings.  If IGNORE is a window, ignore
restrictions for that window only.  If IGNORE equals `safe',
live windows may get as small as `window-safe-min-height' lines
and `window-safe-min-width' columns.  Any other non-nil value
means ignore all of the above restrictions for all windows.</p>
<p>
This function resizes other windows proportionally and never
deletes any windows.  If you want to move only the low (right)
edge of WINDOW consider using `adjust-window-trailing-edge'
instead.</p>
