<h3>Function: newline-and-indent</h3>
<p>
Insert a newline, then indent according to major mode.<br>
Indentation is done using the value of `indent-line-function'.<br>
In programming language modes, this is the same as TAB.<br>
In some text modes, where TAB inserts a tab, this command indents to the<br>
column specified by the function `current-left-margin'.</p>
