<h3>Function: get-char-property-and-overlay</h3>
<p>
Like `get-char-property', but with extra overlay information.
The value is a cons cell.  Its car is the return value of `get-char-property'
with the same arguments--that is, the value of POSITION's property
PROP in OBJECT.  Its cdr is the overlay in which the property was
found, or nil, if it was found as a text property or not found at all.</p>
<p>
OBJECT is optional and defaults to the current buffer.  OBJECT may be
a string, a buffer or a window.  For strings, the cdr of the return
value is always nil, since strings do not have overlays.  If OBJECT is
a window, then that window's buffer is used, but window-specific
overlays are considered only if they are associated with OBJECT.  If
POSITION is at the end of OBJECT, both car and cdr are nil.</p>
