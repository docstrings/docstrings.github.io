<h3>Variable: text-property-default-nonsticky</h3>
<p>
Alist of properties vs the corresponding non-stickiness.
Each element has the form (PROPERTY . NONSTICKINESS).</p>
<p>
If a character in a buffer has PROPERTY, new text inserted adjacent to
the character doesn't inherit PROPERTY if NONSTICKINESS is non-nil,
inherits it if NONSTICKINESS is nil.  The `front-sticky' and
`rear-nonsticky' properties of the character override NONSTICKINESS.</p>
