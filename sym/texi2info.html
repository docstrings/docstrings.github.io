<h3>Function: texi2info</h3>
<p>
Convert the current buffer (written in Texinfo code) into an Info file.
The Info file output is generated in a buffer visiting the Info file
names specified in the @setfilename command.</p>
<p>
This function automatically updates all node pointers and menus, and
creates a master menu.  This work is done on a temporary buffer that
is automatically removed when the Info file is created.  The original
Texinfo source buffer is not changed.</p>
<p>
Non-nil argument (prefix, if interactive) means don't split the file
if large.  You can use `Info-split' to do this manually.</p>
