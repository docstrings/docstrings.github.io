<h3>Variable: mark-even-if-inactive</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means you can use the mark even when inactive.<br>
This option makes a difference in Transient Mark mode.<br>
When the option is non-nil, deactivation of the mark<br>
turns off region highlighting, but commands that use the mark<br>
behave as if the mark were still active.</p>
