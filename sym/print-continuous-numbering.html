<h3>Variable: print-continuous-numbering</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means number continuously across print calls.
This affects the numbers printed for #N= labels and #M# references.
See also `print-circle', `print-gensym', and `print-number-table'.
This variable should not be set with `setq'; bind it with a `let' instead.</p>
