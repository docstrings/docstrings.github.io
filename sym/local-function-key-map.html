<h3>Variable: local-function-key-map</h3>
<p>
Keymap that translates key sequences to key sequences during input.<br>
This is used mainly for mapping key sequences into some preferred<br>
key events (symbols).<br>
<br>
The `read-key-sequence' function replaces any subsequence bound by<br>
`local-function-key-map' with its binding.  More precisely, when the<br>
active keymaps have no binding for the current key sequence but<br>
`local-function-key-map' binds a suffix of the sequence to a vector or<br>
string, `read-key-sequence' replaces the matching suffix with its<br>
binding, and continues with the new sequence.<br>
<br>
If the binding is a function, it is called with one argument (the prompt)<br>
and its return value (a key sequence) is used.<br>
<br>
The events that come from bindings in `local-function-key-map' are not<br>
themselves looked up in `local-function-key-map'.<br>
<br>
For example, suppose `local-function-key-map' binds `ESC O P' to [f1].<br>
Typing `ESC O P' to `read-key-sequence' would return [f1].  Typing<br>
`C-x ESC O P' would return [?\C-x f1].  If [f1] were a prefix key,<br>
typing `ESC O P x' would return [f1 x].<br>
<br>
`local-function-key-map' has a separate binding for each terminal<br>
device.  See Info node `(elisp)Multiple Terminals'.  If you need to<br>
define a binding on all terminals, change `function-key-map'<br>
instead.  Initially, `local-function-key-map' is an empty keymap that
has `function-key-map' as its parent on all terminal devices.</p>
