<h3>Function: diff-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for viewing/editing context diffs.<br>
Supports unified and context diffs as well as (to a lesser extent)<br>
normal diffs.<br>
<br>
When the buffer is read-only, the ESC prefix is not necessary.<br>
If you edit the buffer manually, diff-mode will try to update the hunk<br>
headers for you on-the-fly.<br>
<br>
You can also switch between context diff and unified diff with M-x diff-context->unified,<br>
or vice versa with M-x diff-unified->context and you can also reverse the direction of<br>
a diff with M-x diff-reverse-direction.<br>
<br>
   <br>
Uses keymap `diff-mode-map', which is not currently defined.
