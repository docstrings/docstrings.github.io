<h3>Function: diff-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for viewing/editing context diffs.
Supports unified and context diffs as well as (to a lesser extent)
normal diffs.</p>
<p>
When the buffer is read-only, the ESC prefix is not necessary.
If you edit the buffer manually, diff-mode will try to update the hunk
headers for you on-the-fly.</p>
<p>
You can also switch between context diff and unified diff with M-x diff-context->unified,
or vice versa with M-x diff-unified->context and you can also reverse the direction of
a diff with M-x diff-reverse-direction.</p>
<p>
   
Uses keymap `diff-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
