<h3>Function: file-attributes</h3>
<p>
Return a list of attributes of file FILENAME.
Value is nil if specified file cannot be opened.</p>
<p>
ID-FORMAT specifies the preferred format of attributes uid and gid (see
below) - valid values are 'string and 'integer.  The latter is the
default, but we plan to change that, so you should specify a non-nil value
for ID-FORMAT if you use the returned uid or gid.</p>
<p>
Elements of the attribute list are:
 0. t for directory, string (name linked to) for symbolic link, or nil.
 1. Number of links to file.
 2. File uid as a string or a number.  If a string value cannot be
  looked up, a numeric value, either an integer or a float, is returned.
 3. File gid, likewise.
 4. Last access time, as a list of integers (HIGH LOW USEC PSEC) in the
  same style as (current-time).
  (See a note below about access time on FAT-based filesystems.)
 5. Last modification time, likewise.  This is the time of the last
  change to the file's contents.
 6. Last status change time, likewise.  This is the time of last change
  to the file's attributes: owner and group, access mode bits, etc.
 7. Size in bytes.
  This is a floating point number if the size is too large for an integer.
 8. File modes, as a string of ten letters or dashes as in ls -l.
 9. t if file's gid would change if file were deleted and recreated.
10. inode number.  If it is larger than what an Emacs integer can hold,
  this is of the form (HIGH . LOW): first the high bits, then the low 16 bits.
  If even HIGH is too large for an Emacs integer, this is instead of the form
  (HIGH MIDDLE . LOW): first the high bits, then the middle 24 bits,
  and finally the low 16 bits.
11. Filesystem device number.  If it is larger than what the Emacs
  integer can hold, this is a cons cell, similar to the inode number.</p>
<p>
On most filesystems, the combination of the inode and the device
number uniquely identifies the file.</p>
<p>
On MS-Windows, performance depends on `w32-get-true-file-attributes',
which see.</p>
<p>
On some FAT-based filesystems, only the date of last access is recorded,
so last access time will always be midnight of that day.</p>
