<h3>Function: text-char-description</h3>
<p>
Return a pretty description of file-character CHARACTER.<br>
Control characters turn into "^char", etc.  This differs from<br>
`single-key-description' which turns them into "C-char".<br>
Also, this function recognizes the 2**7 bit as the Meta character,<br>
whereas `single-key-description' uses the 2**27 bit for Meta.<br>
See Info node `(elisp)Describing Characters' for examples.
