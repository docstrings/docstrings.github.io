<h3>Function: texinfo-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for editing Texinfo files.<br>
<br>
  It has these extra commands:<br>
<br>
Uses keymap `texinfo-mode-map', which is not currently defined.<br>
<br>
<br>
  These are files that are used as input for TeX to make printed manuals<br>
and also to be turned into Info files with M-x makeinfo-buffer or<br>
the `makeinfo' program.  These files must be written in a very restricted and<br>
modified version of TeX input format.<br>
<br>
  Editing commands are like text-mode except that the syntax table is<br>
set up so expression commands skip Texinfo bracket groups.  To see<br>
what the Info version of a region of the Texinfo file will look like,<br>
use M-x makeinfo-region, which runs `makeinfo' on the current region.<br>
<br>
  You can show the structure of a Texinfo file with M-x texinfo-show-structure.<br>
This command shows the structure of a Texinfo file by listing the<br>
lines with the @-sign commands for @chapter, @section, and the like.<br>
These lines are displayed in another window called the *Occur* window.<br>
In that window, you can position the cursor over one of the lines and<br>
use M-x occur-mode-goto-occurrence, to jump to the corresponding spot<br>
in the Texinfo file.<br>
<br>
  In addition, Texinfo mode provides commands that insert various<br>
frequently used @-sign commands into the buffer.  You can use these<br>
commands to save keystrokes.  And you can insert balanced braces with<br>
M-x texinfo-insert-braces and later use the command M-x up-list to<br>
move forward past the closing brace.<br>
<br>
Also, Texinfo mode provides functions for automatically creating or<br>
updating menus and node pointers.  These functions<br>
<br>
  * insert the `Next', `Previous' and `Up' pointers of a node,<br>
  * insert or update the menu for a section, and<br>
  * create a master menu for a Texinfo source file.<br>
<br>
Here are the functions:<br>
<br>
    texinfo-update-node                M-x texinfo-update-node<br>
    texinfo-every-node-update          M-x texinfo-every-node-update<br>
    texinfo-sequential-node-update<br>
<br>
    texinfo-make-menu                  M-x texinfo-make-menu<br>
    texinfo-all-menus-update           M-x texinfo-all-menus-update<br>
    texinfo-master-menu<br>
<br>
    texinfo-indent-menu-description (column &optional region-p)<br>
<br>
The `texinfo-column-for-description' variable specifies the column to<br>
which menu descriptions are indented.<br>
<br>
Passed an argument (a prefix argument, if interactive), the<br>
`texinfo-update-node' and `texinfo-make-menu' functions do their jobs<br>
in the region.<br>
<br>
To use the updating commands, you must structure your Texinfo file<br>
hierarchically, such that each `@node' line, with the exception of the<br>
Top node, is accompanied by some kind of section line, such as an<br>
`@chapter' or `@section' line.

If the file has a `top' node, it must be called `top' or `Top' and
be the first node in the file.

Entering Texinfo mode calls the value of `text-mode-hook', and then the
value of `texinfo-mode-hook'.
