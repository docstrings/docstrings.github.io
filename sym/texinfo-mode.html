<h3>Function: texinfo-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for editing Texinfo files.</p>
<p>
  It has these extra commands:</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `texinfo-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

  These are files that are used as input for TeX to make printed manuals
and also to be turned into Info files with M-x makeinfo-buffer or
the `makeinfo' program.  These files must be written in a very restricted and
modified version of TeX input format.</p>
<p>
  Editing commands are like text-mode except that the syntax table is
set up so expression commands skip Texinfo bracket groups.  To see
what the Info version of a region of the Texinfo file will look like,
use M-x makeinfo-region, which runs `makeinfo' on the current region.</p>
<p>
  You can show the structure of a Texinfo file with M-x texinfo-show-structure.
This command shows the structure of a Texinfo file by listing the
lines with the @-sign commands for @chapter, @section, and the like.
These lines are displayed in another window called the *Occur* window.
In that window, you can position the cursor over one of the lines and
use M-x occur-mode-goto-occurrence, to jump to the corresponding spot
in the Texinfo file.</p>
<p>
  In addition, Texinfo mode provides commands that insert various
frequently used @-sign commands into the buffer.  You can use these
commands to save keystrokes.  And you can insert balanced braces with
M-x texinfo-insert-braces and later use the command M-x up-list to
move forward past the closing brace.</p>
<p>
Also, Texinfo mode provides functions for automatically creating or
updating menus and node pointers.  These functions</p>
<p>
  * insert the `Next', `Previous' and `Up' pointers of a node,
  * insert or update the menu for a section, and
  * create a master menu for a Texinfo source file.</p>
<p>
Here are the functions:</p>
<p>
    texinfo-update-node                M-x texinfo-update-node
    texinfo-every-node-update          M-x texinfo-every-node-update
    texinfo-sequential-node-update</p>
<p>
    texinfo-make-menu                  M-x texinfo-make-menu
    texinfo-all-menus-update           M-x texinfo-all-menus-update
    texinfo-master-menu</p>
<p>
    texinfo-indent-menu-description (column &optional region-p)</p>
<p>
The `texinfo-column-for-description' variable specifies the column to
which menu descriptions are indented.</p>
<p>
Passed an argument (a prefix argument, if interactive), the
`texinfo-update-node' and `texinfo-make-menu' functions do their jobs
in the region.</p>
<p>
To use the updating commands, you must structure your Texinfo file
hierarchically, such that each `@node' line, with the exception of the
Top node, is accompanied by some kind of section line, such as an
`@chapter' or `@section' line.</p>
<p>
If the file has a `top' node, it must be called `top' or `Top' and
be the first node in the file.</p>
<p>
Entering Texinfo mode calls the value of `text-mode-hook', and then the
value of `texinfo-mode-hook'.</p>
