<h3>Function: window-size-fixed-p</h3>
<p>
Return non-nil if WINDOW's height is fixed.
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.
Optional argument HORIZONTAL non-nil means return non-nil if
WINDOW's width is fixed.</p>
<p>
If this function returns nil, this does not necessarily mean that
WINDOW can be resized in the desired direction.  The function
`window-resizable' can tell that.</p>
