<h3>Function: file-cache-add-directory-list</h3>
<p>
Add DIRECTORY-LIST (a list of directory names) to the file cache.
If the optional REGEXP argument is non-nil, only files which match it
will be added to the cache.  Note that the REGEXP is applied to the
files in each directory, not to the directory list itself.</p>
