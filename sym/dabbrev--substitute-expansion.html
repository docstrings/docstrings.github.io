<h3>Function: dabbrev--substitute-expansion</h3>
<p>
Replace OLD with EXPANSION in the buffer.
OLD is text currently in the buffer, perhaps the abbreviation
or perhaps another expansion that was tried previously.
ABBREV is the abbreviation we are expanding.
It is " " if we are copying subsequent words.
EXPANSION is the expansion substring to be used this time.
RECORD-CASE-PATTERN, if non-nil, means set `dabbrev--last-case-pattern'
to record whether we upcased the expansion, downcased it, or did neither.</p>
