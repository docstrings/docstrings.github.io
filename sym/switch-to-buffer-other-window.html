<h3>Function: switch-to-buffer-other-window</h3>
<p>
Select the buffer specified by BUFFER-OR-NAME in another window.<br>
BUFFER-OR-NAME may be a buffer, a string (a buffer name), or<br>
nil.  Return the buffer switched to.<br>
<br>
If called interactively, prompt for the buffer name using the<br>
minibuffer.  The variable `confirm-nonexistent-file-or-buffer'<br>
determines whether to request confirmation before creating a new<br>
buffer.<br>
<br>
If BUFFER-OR-NAME is a string and does not identify an existing<br>
buffer, create a new buffer with that name.  If BUFFER-OR-NAME is<br>
nil, switch to the buffer returned by `other-buffer'.<br>
<br>
Optional second argument NORECORD non-nil means do not put this<br>
buffer at the front of the list of recently selected ones.<br>
<br>
This uses the function `display-buffer' as a subroutine; see its
documentation for additional customization information.</p>
