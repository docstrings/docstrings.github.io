<h3>Function: switch-to-buffer-other-window</h3>
<p>
Select the buffer specified by BUFFER-OR-NAME in another window.
BUFFER-OR-NAME may be a buffer, a string (a buffer name), or
nil.  Return the buffer switched to.</p>
<p>
If called interactively, prompt for the buffer name using the
minibuffer.  The variable `confirm-nonexistent-file-or-buffer'
determines whether to request confirmation before creating a new
buffer.</p>
<p>
If BUFFER-OR-NAME is a string and does not identify an existing
buffer, create a new buffer with that name.  If BUFFER-OR-NAME is
nil, switch to the buffer returned by `other-buffer'.</p>
<p>
Optional second argument NORECORD non-nil means do not put this
buffer at the front of the list of recently selected ones.</p>
<p>
This uses the function `display-buffer' as a subroutine; see its
documentation for additional customization information.</p>
