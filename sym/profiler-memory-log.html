<h3>Function: profiler-memory-log</h3>
<p>
Return the current memory profiler log.
The log is a hash-table mapping backtraces to counters which represent
the amount of memory allocated at those points.  Every backtrace is a vector
of functions, where the last few elements may be nil.
Before returning, a new log is allocated for future samples.</p>
