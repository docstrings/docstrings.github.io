<h3>Function: update-directory-autoloads</h3>
<p>
Update autoload definitions for Lisp files in the directories DIRS.
In an interactive call, you must give one argument, the name of a
single directory.  In a call from Lisp, you can supply multiple
directories as separate arguments, but this usage is discouraged.</p>
<p>
The function does NOT recursively descend into subdirectories of the
directory or directories specified.</p>
<p>
In an interactive call, prompt for a default output file for the
autoload definitions, and temporarily bind the variable
`generated-autoload-file' to this value.  When called from Lisp,
use the existing value of `generated-autoload-file'.  If any Lisp
file binds `generated-autoload-file' as a file-local variable,
write its autoloads into the specified file instead.</p>
