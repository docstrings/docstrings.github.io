<h3>Function: string-to-multibyte</h3>
<p>
Return a multibyte string with the same individual chars as STRING.
If STRING is multibyte, the result is STRING itself.
Otherwise it is a newly created string, with no text properties.</p>
<p>
If STRING is unibyte and contains an 8-bit byte, it is converted to
the corresponding multibyte character of charset `eight-bit'.</p>
<p>
This differs from `string-as-multibyte' by converting each byte of a correct
utf-8 sequence to an eight-bit character, not just bytes that don't form a
correct sequence.</p>
