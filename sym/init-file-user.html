<h3>Variable: init-file-user</h3>
<p>
Identity of user whose init file is or was read.
The value is nil if `-q' or `--no-init-file' was specified,
meaning do not load any init file.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, the value may be an empty string, meaning
use the init file for the user who originally logged in,
or it may be a string containing a user's name meaning
use that person's init file.</p>
<p>
In either of the latter cases, `(concat "~" init-file-user "/")'
evaluates to the name of the directory where the init file was
looked for.</p>
<p>
Setting `init-file-user' does not prevent Emacs from loading
`site-start.el'.  The only way to do that is to use `--no-site-file'.</p>
