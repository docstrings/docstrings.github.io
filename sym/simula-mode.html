<h3>Function: simula-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for editing SIMULA code.</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `simula-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
Variables controlling indentation style:
 `simula-tab-always-indent'
    Non-nil means TAB in SIMULA mode should always reindent the current line,
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 `simula-indent-level'
    Indentation of SIMULA statements with respect to containing block.
 `simula-substatement-offset'
    Extra indentation after DO, THEN, ELSE, WHEN and OTHERWISE.
 `simula-continued-statement-offset' 3
    Extra indentation for lines not starting a statement or substatement,
    e.g. a nested FOR-loop.  If value is a list, each line in a multiple-
    line continued statement will have the car of the list extra indentation
    with respect to the previous line of the statement.
 `simula-label-offset' -4711
    Offset of SIMULA label lines relative to usual indentation.
 `simula-if-indent' '(0 . 0)
    Extra indentation of THEN and ELSE with respect to the starting IF.
    Value is a cons cell, the car is extra THEN indentation and the cdr
    extra ELSE indentation.  IF after ELSE is indented as the starting IF.
 `simula-inspect-indent' '(0 . 0)
    Extra indentation of WHEN and OTHERWISE with respect to the
    corresponding INSPECT.  Value is a cons cell, the car is
    extra WHEN indentation and the cdr extra OTHERWISE indentation.
 `simula-electric-indent' nil
    If this variable is non-nil, `simula-indent-line'
    will check the previous line to see if it has to be reindented.
 `simula-abbrev-keyword' 'upcase
    Determine how SIMULA keywords will be expanded.  Value is one of
    the symbols `upcase', `downcase', `capitalize', (as in) `abbrev-table',
    or nil if they should not be changed.
 `simula-abbrev-stdproc' 'abbrev-table
    Determine how standard SIMULA procedure and class names will be
    expanded.  Value is one of the symbols `upcase', `downcase', `capitalize',
    (as in) `abbrev-table', or nil if they should not be changed.</p>
<p>
Turning on SIMULA mode calls the value of the variable simula-mode-hook
with no arguments, if that value is non-nil.</p>
