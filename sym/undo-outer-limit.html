<h3>Variable: undo-outer-limit</h3>
<p>
Outer limit on size of undo information for one command.<br>
At garbage collection time, if the current command has produced<br>
more than this much undo information, it discards the info and displays<br>
a warning.  This is a last-ditch limit to prevent memory overflow.<br>
<br>
The size is counted as the number of bytes occupied, which includes<br>
both saved text and other data.  A value of nil means no limit.  In<br>
this case, accumulating one huge undo entry could make Emacs crash as<br>
a result of memory overflow.<br>
<br>
In fact, this calls the function which is the value of<br>
`undo-outer-limit-function' with one argument, the size.<br>
The text above describes the behavior of the function
that variable usually specifies.</p>
