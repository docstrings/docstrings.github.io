<h3>Function: run-hooks</h3>
<p>
Run each hook in HOOKS.
Each argument should be a symbol, a hook variable.
These symbols are processed in the order specified.
If a hook symbol has a non-nil value, that value may be a function
or a list of functions to be called to run the hook.
If the value is a function, it is called with no arguments.
If it is a list, the elements are called, in order, with no arguments.</p>
<p>
Major modes should not use this function directly to run their mode
hook; they should use `run-mode-hooks' instead.</p>
<p>
Do not use `make-local-variable' to make a hook variable buffer-local.
Instead, use `add-hook' and specify t for the LOCAL argument.</p>
