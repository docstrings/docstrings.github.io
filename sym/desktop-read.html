<h3>Function: desktop-read</h3>
<p>
Read and process the desktop file in directory DIRNAME.<br>
Look for a desktop file in DIRNAME, or if DIRNAME is omitted, look in<br>
directories listed in `desktop-path'.  If a desktop file is found, it<br>
is processed and `desktop-after-read-hook' is run.  If no desktop file<br>
is found, clear the desktop and run `desktop-no-desktop-file-hook'.<br>
This function is a no-op when Emacs is running in batch mode.<br>
It returns t if a desktop file was loaded, nil otherwise.
