<h3>Function: set-process-inherit-coding-system-flag</h3>
<p>
Determine whether buffer of PROCESS will inherit coding-system.
If the second argument FLAG is non-nil, then the variable
`buffer-file-coding-system' of the buffer associated with PROCESS
will be bound to the value of the coding system used to decode
the process output.</p>
<p>
This is useful when the coding system specified for the process buffer
leaves either the character code conversion or the end-of-line conversion
unspecified, or if the coding system used to decode the process output
is more appropriate for saving the process buffer.</p>
<p>
Binding the variable `inherit-process-coding-system' to non-nil before
starting the process is an alternative way of setting the inherit flag
for the process which will run.</p>
<p>
This function returns FLAG.</p>
