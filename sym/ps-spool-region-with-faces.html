<h3>Function: ps-spool-region-with-faces</h3>
<p>
Generate a PostScript image of the region and spool locally.
Like `ps-spool-region', but includes font, color, and underline information in
the generated image.  This command works only if you are using a window system,
so it has a way to determine color values.</p>
<p>
Use the command `ps-despool' to send the spooled images to the printer.</p>
