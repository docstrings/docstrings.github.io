<h3>Variable: line-move-visual</h3>
<p>
When non-nil, `line-move' moves point by visual lines.<br>
This movement is based on where the cursor is displayed on the<br>
screen, instead of relying on buffer contents alone.  It takes<br>
into account variable-width characters and line continuation.<br>
If nil, `line-move' moves point by logical lines.<br>
A non-nil setting of `goal-column' overrides the value of this variable<br>
and forces movement by logical lines.<br>
A window that is  horizontally scrolled also forces movement by logical
lines.</p>
