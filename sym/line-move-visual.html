<h3>Variable: line-move-visual</h3>
<p>
When non-nil, `line-move' moves point by visual lines.
This movement is based on where the cursor is displayed on the
screen, instead of relying on buffer contents alone.  It takes
into account variable-width characters and line continuation.
If nil, `line-move' moves point by logical lines.
A non-nil setting of `goal-column' overrides the value of this variable
and forces movement by logical lines.
A window that is  horizontally scrolled also forces movement by logical
lines.</p>
