<h3>Function: package-handle-response</h3>
<p>
Handle the response from a `url-retrieve-synchronously' call.
Parse the HTTP response and throw if an error occurred.
The url package seems to require extra processing for this.
This should be called in a `save-excursion', in the download buffer.
It will move point to somewhere in the headers.</p>
