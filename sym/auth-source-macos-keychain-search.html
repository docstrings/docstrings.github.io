<h3>Function: auth-source-macos-keychain-search</h3>
<p>
Search the MacOS Keychain; spec is like `auth-source'.</p>
<p>
All search keys must match exactly.  If you need substring
matching, do a wider search and narrow it down yourself.</p>
<p>
You'll get back all the properties of the token as a plist.</p>
<p>
The :type key is either 'macos-keychain-internet or
'macos-keychain-generic.</p>
<p>
For the internet keychain type, the :label key searches the
item's labels ("-l LABEL" passed to "/usr/bin/security").
Similarly, :host maps to "-s HOST", :user maps to "-a USER",
and :port maps to "-P PORT" or "-r PROT"
(note PROT has to be a 4-character string).</p>
<p>
For the generic keychain type, the :label key searches the item's
labels ("-l LABEL" passed to "/usr/bin/security").
Similarly, :host maps to "-c HOST" (the "creator" keychain
field), :user maps to "-a USER", and :port maps to "-s PORT".</p>
<p>
Here's an example that looks for the first item in the default
generic MacOS Keychain:</p>
<p>
 (let ((auth-sources '(macos-keychain-generic)))
    (auth-source-search :max 1)</p>
<p>
Here's another that looks for the first item in the internet
MacOS Keychain collection whose label is 'gnus':</p>
<p>
 (let ((auth-sources '(macos-keychain-internet)))
    (auth-source-search :max 1 :label "gnus")</p>
<p>
And this one looks for the first item in the internet keychain
entries for git.gnus.org:</p>
<p>
 (let ((auth-sources '(macos-keychain-internet")))
    (auth-source-search :max 1 :host "git.gnus.org"))</p>
<p>
(fn &rest SPEC &key BACKEND CREATE DELETE LABEL TYPE MAX HOST USER PORT &allow-other-keys)</p>
