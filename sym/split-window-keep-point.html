<h3>Variable: split-window-keep-point</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, C-x 2 preserves point in the new window.
If nil, adjust point in the two windows to minimize redisplay.
This option applies only to `split-window-below' and functions
that call it.  The low-level `split-window' function always keeps
the original point in both windows.</p>
