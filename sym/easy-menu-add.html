<h3>Function: easy-menu-add</h3>
<p>
Add the menu to the menubar.<br>
On Emacs, menus are already automatically activated when the<br>
corresponding keymap is activated.  On XEmacs this is needed to<br>
actually add the menu to the current menubar.<br>
<br>
You should call this once the menu and keybindings are set up<br>
completely and menu filter functions can be expected to work.</p>
