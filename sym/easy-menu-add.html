<h3>Function: easy-menu-add</h3>
<p>
Add the menu to the menubar.
On Emacs, menus are already automatically activated when the
corresponding keymap is activated.  On XEmacs this is needed to
actually add the menu to the current menubar.</p>
<p>
You should call this once the menu and keybindings are set up
completely and menu filter functions can be expected to work.</p>
