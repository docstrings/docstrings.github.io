<h3>Function: append-to-file</h3>
<p>
Append the contents of the region to the end of file FILENAME.<br>
When called from a function, expects three arguments,<br>
START, END and FILENAME.  START and END are normally buffer positions<br>
specifying the part of the buffer to write.<br>
If START is nil, that means to use the entire buffer contents.<br>
If START is a string, then output that string to the file<br>
instead of any buffer contents; END is ignored.<br>
<br>
This does character code conversion and applies annotations
like `write-region' does.</p>
