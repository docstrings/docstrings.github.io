<h3>Variable: xterm-extra-capabilities</h3>
<p>
Whether Xterm supports some additional, more modern, features.
If nil, just assume that it does not.
If `check', try to check if it does.
If a list, assume that the listed features are supported, without checking.</p>
<p>
The relevant features are:
  modifyOtherKeys  -- if supported, more key bindings work (e.g., "\C-,")
  reportBackground -- if supported, Xterm reports its background color
</p>
