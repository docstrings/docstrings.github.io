<h3>Function: Info-goto-node</h3>
<p>
Go to Info node named NODENAME.  Give just NODENAME or (FILENAME)NODENAME.
If NODENAME is of the form (FILENAME)NODENAME, the node is in the Info file
FILENAME; otherwise, NODENAME should be in the current Info file (or one of
its sub-files).
Completion is available, but only for node names in the current Info file.
If FORK is non-nil (interactively with a prefix arg), show the node in
a new Info buffer.
If FORK is a string, it is the name to use for the new buffer.</p>
