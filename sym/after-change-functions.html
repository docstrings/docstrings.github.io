<h3>Variable: after-change-functions</h3>
<p>
List of functions to call after each text change.
Three arguments are passed to each function: the positions of
the beginning and end of the range of changed text,
and the length in bytes of the pre-change text replaced by that range.
(For an insertion, the pre-change length is zero;
for a deletion, that length is the number of bytes deleted,
and the post-change beginning and end are at the same place.)</p>
<p>
Buffer changes made while executing the `after-change-functions'
don't call any before-change or after-change functions.
That's because `inhibit-modification-hooks' is temporarily set non-nil.</p>
<p>
If an unhandled error happens in running these functions,
the variable's value remains nil.  That prevents the error
from happening repeatedly and making Emacs nonfunctional.</p>
