<h3>Variable: selection-coding-system</h3>
<p>
Coding system for communicating with other programs.</p>
<p>
For MS-Windows and MS-DOS:
When sending or receiving text via selection and clipboard, the text
is encoded or decoded by this coding system.  The default value is
the current system default encoding on 9x/Me, `utf-16le-dos'
(Unicode) on NT/W2K/XP, and `iso-latin-1-dos' on MS-DOS.</p>
<p>
For X Windows:
When sending text via selection and clipboard, if the target
data-type matches with the type of this coding system, it is used
for encoding the text.  Otherwise (including the case that this
variable is nil), a proper coding system is used as below:</p>
<p>
data-type	coding system
---------	-------------
UTF8_STRING	utf-8
COMPOUND_TEXT	compound-text-with-extensions
STRING		iso-latin-1
C_STRING	no-conversion</p>
<p>
When receiving text, if this coding system is non-nil, it is used
for decoding regardless of the data-type.  If this is nil, a
proper coding system is used according to the data-type as above.</p>
<p>
See also the documentation of the variable `x-select-request-type' how
to control which data-type to request for receiving text.</p>
<p>
The default value is nil.</p>
