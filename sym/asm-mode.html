<h3>Function: asm-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for editing typical assembler code.<br>
Features a private abbrev table and the following bindings:<br>
<br>
M-x asm-colon	outdent a preceding label, tab to next tab stop.<br>
M-i	tab to next tab stop.<br>
M-x asm-newline	newline, then tab to next tab stop.<br>
M-x asm-comment	smart placement of assembler comments.<br>
<br>
The character used for making comments is set by the variable<br>
`asm-comment-char' (which defaults to `?\;').<br>
<br>
Alternatively, you may set this variable in `asm-mode-set-comment-hook',<br>
which is called near the beginning of mode initialization.<br>
<br>
Turning on Asm mode runs the hook `asm-mode-hook' at the end of initialization.<br>
<br>
