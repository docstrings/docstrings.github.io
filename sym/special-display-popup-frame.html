<h3>Function: special-display-popup-frame</h3>
<p>
Pop up a frame displaying BUFFER and return its window.

raise that frame.  Otherwise, display BUFFER in a new frame.</p>
<p>
Optional argument ARGS is a list specifying additional
information.</p>
<p>
If ARGS is an alist, use it as a list of frame parameters.  If
these parameters contain (same-window . t), display BUFFER in
the selected window.  If they contain (same-frame . t), display
BUFFER in a window of the selected frame.</p>
