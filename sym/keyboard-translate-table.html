<h3>Variable: keyboard-translate-table</h3>
<p>
Translate table for local keyboard input, or nil.
If non-nil, the value should be a char-table.  Each character read
from the keyboard is looked up in this char-table.  If the value found
there is non-nil, then it is used instead of the actual input character.</p>
<p>
The value can also be a string or vector, but this is considered obsolete.
If it is a string or vector of length N, character codes N and up are left
untranslated.  In a vector, an element which is nil means "no translation".</p>
<p>
This is applied to the characters supplied to input methods, not their
output.  See also `translation-table-for-input'.</p>
<p>
This variable has a separate binding for each terminal.
See Info node `(elisp)Multiple Terminals'.</p>
