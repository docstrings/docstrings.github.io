<h3>Function: lisp-interaction-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for typing and evaluating Lisp forms.
Like Lisp mode except that M-x eval-print-last-sexp evals the Lisp expression
before point, and prints its value into the buffer, advancing point.
Note that printing is controlled by `eval-expression-print-length'
and `eval-expression-print-level'.</p>
<p>
Commands:
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.
Paragraphs are separated only by blank lines.
Semicolons start comments.</p>
