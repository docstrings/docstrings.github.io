<h3>Variable: compilation-start-hook</h3>
<p>
List of hook functions run by `compilation-start' on the compilation process.
(See `run-hook-with-args').
If you use "omake -P" and do not want C-x C-c to ask whether you want
the compilation to be killed, you can use this hook:
  (add-hook 'compilation-start-hook
    (lambda (process) (set-process-query-on-exit-flag process nil)) nil t)</p>
