<h3>Function: set-mark-command</h3>
<p>
Set the mark where point is, or jump to the mark.
Setting the mark also alters the region, which is the text
between point and mark; this is the closest equivalent in
Emacs to what some editors call the "selection".</p>
<p>
With no prefix argument, set the mark at point, and push the
old mark position on local mark ring.  Also push the old mark on
global mark ring, if the previous mark was set in another buffer.</p>
<p>
When Transient Mark Mode is off, immediately repeating this
command activates `transient-mark-mode' temporarily.</p>
<p>
With prefix argument (e.g., C-u C-SPC), jump to the mark, and set the mark from
position popped off the local mark ring (this does not affect the global
mark ring).  Use C-x C-@ to jump to a mark popped off the global
mark ring (see `pop-global-mark').</p>
<p>
If `set-mark-command-repeat-pop' is non-nil, repeating
the C-SPC command with no prefix argument pops the next position
off the local (or global) mark ring and jumps there.</p>
<p>
With C-u C-u as prefix
argument, unconditionally set mark where point is, even if
`set-mark-command-repeat-pop' is non-nil.</p>
<p>
Novice Emacs Lisp programmers often try to use the mark for the wrong
purposes.  See the documentation of `set-mark' for more information.</p>
