<h3>Variable: read-symbol-positions-list</h3>
<p>
A list mapping read symbols to their positions.
This variable is modified during calls to `read' or
`read-from-string', but only when `read-with-symbol-positions' is
non-nil.</p>
<p>
Each element of the list looks like (SYMBOL . CHAR-POSITION), where
CHAR-POSITION is an integer giving the offset of that occurrence of the
symbol from the position where `read' or `read-from-string' started.</p>
<p>
Note that a symbol will appear multiple times in this list, if it was
read multiple times.  The list is in the same order as the symbols
were read in.</p>
