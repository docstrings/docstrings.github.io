<h3>Function: get-internal-run-time</h3>
<p>
Return the current run time used by Emacs.<br>
The time is returned as a list (HIGH LOW USEC PSEC), using the same<br>
style as (current-time).<br>
<br>
On systems that can't determine the run time, `get-internal-run-time'<br>
does the same thing as `current-time'.
