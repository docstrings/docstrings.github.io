as selected with the variable `mail-user-agent'.
The optional arguments TO and SUBJECT specify recipients
and the initial Subject field, respectively.</p>
<p>
OTHER-HEADERS is an alist specifying additional
header fields.  Elements look like (HEADER . VALUE) where both

CONTINUE, if non-nil, says to continue editing a message already
being composed.  Interactively, CONTINUE is the prefix argument.</p>

<p>

to insert the raw text of the message being replied to.
It has the form (FUNCTION . ARGS).  The user agent will apply

(The user agent will also run `mail-citation-hook', *after* the
original text has been inserted in this way.)</p>
<p>
SEND-ACTIONS is a list of actions to call when the message is sent.
Each action has the form (FUNCTION . ARGS).</p>
<p>
RETURN-ACTION, if non-nil, is an action for returning to the
caller.  It has the form (FUNCTION . ARGS).  The function is
called after the mail has been sent or put aside, and the mail
buffer buried.</p>
