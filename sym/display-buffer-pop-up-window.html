<h3>Function: display-buffer-pop-up-window</h3>
<p>
Display BUFFER by popping up a new window.
The new window is created on the selected frame, or in
`last-nonminibuffer-frame' if no windows can be created there.
If successful, return the new window; otherwise return nil.</p>
<p>
If ALIST has a non-nil `inhibit-switch-frame' entry, then in the
event that the new window is created on another frame, avoid
raising the frame.</p>
