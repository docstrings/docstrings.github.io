<h3>Function: xterm-mouse-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle XTerm mouse mode.<br>
With a prefix argument ARG, enable XTerm mouse mode if ARG is<br>
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable<br>
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.<br>
<br>
Turn it on to use Emacs mouse commands, and off to use xterm mouse commands.<br>
This works in terminal emulators compatible with xterm.  It only<br>
works for simple uses of the mouse.  Basically, only non-modified<br>
single clicks are supported.  When turned on, the normal xterm<br>
mouse functionality for such clicks is still available by holding<br>
down the SHIFT key while pressing the mouse button.

(fn &optional ARG)</p>
<h3>Variable: xterm-mouse-mode</h3>
<p>
Non-nil if Xterm-Mouse mode is enabled.<br>
See the command `xterm-mouse-mode' for a description of this minor mode.<br>
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;<br>
either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')<br>
or call the function `xterm-mouse-mode'.</p>
