<h3>Function: vc-state</h3>
<p>
Return the version control state of FILE.</p>
<p>
A return of nil from this function means we have no information on the
status of this file.  Otherwise, the value returned is one of:</p>
<p>
  'up-to-date        The working file is unmodified with respect to the
                     latest version on the current branch, and not locked.</p>
<p>
  'edited            The working file has been edited by the user.  If
                     locking is used for the file, this state means that
                     the current version is locked by the calling user.
                     This status should *not* be reported for files
                     which have a changed mtime but the same content
                     as the repo copy.</p>
<p>
  USER               The current version of the working file is locked by
                     some other USER (a string).</p>
<p>
  'needs-update      The file has not been edited by the user, but there is
                     a more recent version on the current branch stored
                     in the repository.</p>
<p>
  'needs-merge       The file has been edited by the user, and there is also
                     a more recent version on the current branch stored in
                     the repository.  This state can only occur if locking
                     is not used for the file.</p>
<p>
  'unlocked-changes  The working version of the file is not locked,
                     but the working file has been changed with respect
                     to that version.  This state can only occur for files
                     with locking; it represents an erroneous condition that
                     should be resolved by the user (vc-next-action will
                     prompt the user to do it).</p>
<p>
  'added             Scheduled to go into the repository on the next commit.
                     Often represented by vc-working-revision = "0" in VCSes
                     with monotonic IDs like Subversion and Mercurial.</p>
<p>
  'removed           Scheduled to be deleted from the repository on next commit.</p>
<p>
  'conflict          The file contains conflicts as the result of a merge.
                     For now the conflicts are text conflicts.  In the
                     future this might be extended to deal with metadata
                     conflicts too.</p>
<p>
  'missing           The file is not present in the file system, but the VC
                     system still tracks it.</p>
<p>
  'ignored           The file showed up in a dir-status listing with a flag
                     indicating the version-control system is ignoring it,
                     Note: This property is not set reliably (some VCSes
                     don't have useful directory-status commands) so assume
                     that any file with vc-state nil might be ignorable
                     without VC knowing it.</p>
<p>
  'unregistered      The file is not under version control.</p>
