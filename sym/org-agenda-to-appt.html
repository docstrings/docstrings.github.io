<h3>Function: org-agenda-to-appt</h3>
<p>
Activate appointments found in `org-agenda-files'.
With a C-u prefix, refresh the list of
appointments.</p>
<p>
If FILTER is t, interactively prompt the user for a regular
expression, and filter out entries that don't match it.</p>
<p>
If FILTER is a string, use this string as a regular expression
for filtering entries out.</p>
<p>
If FILTER is a function, filter out entries against which
calling the function returns nil.  This function takes one
argument: an entry from `org-agenda-get-day-entries'.</p>
<p>
FILTER can also be an alist with the car of each cell being
either 'headline or 'category.  For example:</p>
<p>
  '((headline "IMPORTANT")
    (category "Work"))</p>
<p>
will only add headlines containing IMPORTANT or headlines
belonging to the "Work" category.</p>
<p>
ARGS are symbols indicating what kind of entries to consider.
By default `org-agenda-to-appt' will use :deadline, :scheduled
and :timestamp entries.  See the docstring of `org-diary' for
details and examples.</p>
<p>
If an entry has a APPT_WARNTIME property, its value will be used
to override `appt-message-warning-time'.</p>
