<h3>Variable: minibuffer-allow-text-properties</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means `read-from-minibuffer' should not discard text properties.<br>
This also affects `read-string', but it does not affect `read-minibuffer',<br>
`read-no-blanks-input', or any of the functions that do minibuffer input<br>
with completion; they always discard text properties.</p>
