<h3>Variable: window-sides-slots</h3>
<p>
Maximum number of side window slots.<br>
The value is a list of four elements specifying the number of<br>
side window slots on (in this order) the left, top, right and<br>
bottom side of each frame.  If an element is a number, this means<br>
to display at most that many side windows on the corresponding<br>
side.  If an element is nil, this means there's no bound on the<br>
number of slots on that side.</p>
