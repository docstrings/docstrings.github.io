<h3>Function: yank-pop</h3>
<p>
Replace just-yanked stretch of killed text with a different stretch.<br>
This command is allowed only immediately after a `yank' or a `yank-pop'.<br>
At such a time, the region contains a stretch of reinserted<br>
previously-killed text.  `yank-pop' deletes that text and inserts in its<br>
place a different stretch of killed text.<br>
<br>
With no argument, the previous kill is inserted.<br>
With argument N, insert the Nth previous kill.<br>
If N is negative, this is a more recent kill.<br>
<br>
The sequence of kills wraps around, so that after the oldest one<br>
comes the newest one.<br>
<br>
When this command inserts killed text into the buffer, it honors<br>
`yank-excluded-properties' and `yank-handler' as described in the
doc string for `insert-for-yank-1', which see.</p>
