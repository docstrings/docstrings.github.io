<h3>Variable: same-window-buffer-names</h3>
<p>
List of names of buffers that should appear in the "same" window.
`display-buffer' and `pop-to-buffer' show a buffer whose name is
on this list in the selected rather than some other window.</p>
<p>
An element of this list can be a cons cell instead of just a
string.  In that case, the cell's car must be a string specifying
the buffer name.  This is for compatibility with
`special-display-buffer-names'; the cdr of the cons cell is
ignored.</p>
<p>
See also `same-window-regexps'.</p>
