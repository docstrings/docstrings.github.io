<h3>Function: make-comint</h3>
<p>
Make a Comint process NAME in a buffer, running PROGRAM.

via `start-file-process', or a cons pair of the form (HOST . SERVICE) denoting
a TCP connection to be opened via `open-network-stream'.  If there is already
a running process in that buffer, it is not restarted.  Optional third arg
STARTFILE is the name of a file, whose contents are sent to the
process as its initial input.</p>

If PROGRAM is a string, any more args are arguments to PROGRAM.</p>
