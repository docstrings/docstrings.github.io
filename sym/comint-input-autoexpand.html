<h3>Variable: comint-input-autoexpand</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, expand input command history references on completion.
This mirrors the optional behavior of tcsh (its autoexpand and histlist).</p>
<p>
If the value is `input', then the expansion is seen on input.
If the value is `history', then the expansion is only when inserting
into the buffer's input ring.  See also `comint-magic-space' and
`comint-dynamic-complete'.</p>
<p>
This variable is buffer-local.</p>
