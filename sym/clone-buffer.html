<h3>Function: clone-buffer</h3>
<p>
Create and return a twin copy of the current buffer.
Unlike an indirect buffer, the new buffer can be edited
independently of the old one (if it is not read-only).
NEWNAME is the name of the new buffer.  It may be modified by
adding or incrementing <N> at the end as necessary to create a
unique buffer name.  If nil, it defaults to the name of the
current buffer, with the proper suffix.  If DISPLAY-FLAG is
non-nil, the new buffer is shown with `pop-to-buffer'.  Trying to
clone a file-visiting buffer, or a buffer whose major mode symbol
has a non-nil `no-clone' property, results in an error.</p>
<p>
Interactively, DISPLAY-FLAG is t and NEWNAME is the name of the
current buffer with appropriate suffix.  However, if a prefix
argument is given, then the command prompts for NEWNAME in the
minibuffer.</p>
<p>
This runs the normal hook `clone-buffer-hook' in the new buffer
after it has been set up properly in other respects.</p>
