<h3>Variable: mouse-wheel-scroll-amount</h3>
<p>
Amount to scroll windows by when spinning the mouse wheel.<br>
This is an alist mapping the modifier key to the amount to scroll when<br>
the wheel is moved with the modifier key depressed.<br>
Elements of the list have the form (MODIFIERS . AMOUNT) or just AMOUNT if<br>
MODIFIERS is nil.<br>
<br>
AMOUNT should be the number of lines to scroll, or nil for near full<br>
screen.  It can also be a floating point number, specifying the fraction of<br>
a full screen to scroll.  A near full screen is `next-screen-context-lines'
less than a full screen.</p>
