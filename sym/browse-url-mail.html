<h3>Function: browse-url-mail</h3>
<p>
Open a new mail message buffer within Emacs for the RFC 2368 URL.
Default to using the mailto: URL around or before point as the
recipient's address.  Supplying a non-nil interactive prefix argument
will cause the mail to be composed in another window rather than the
current one.</p>
<p>
When called interactively, if variable `browse-url-new-window-flag' is
non-nil use `compose-mail-other-window', otherwise `compose-mail'.  A
non-nil interactive prefix argument reverses the effect of
`browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
When called non-interactively, optional second argument NEW-WINDOW is
used instead of `browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
(fn URL &optional NEW-WINDOW)</p>
