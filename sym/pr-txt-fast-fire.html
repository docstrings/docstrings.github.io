<h3>Function: pr-txt-fast-fire</h3>
<p>
Fast fire function for text printing.</p>
<p>
If a region is active, the region will be printed instead of the whole buffer.
Also if the current major-mode is defined in `pr-mode-alist', the settings in
`pr-mode-alist' will be used, that is, the current buffer or region will be
printed using `pr-txt-mode'.</p>
<p>
Interactively, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the
user for a new active text printer.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, the argument SELECT-PRINTER is treated as follows:</p>
<p>
   If it's nil, the printing is sent to the current active text printer.</p>
<p>
   If it's a symbol which it's defined in `pr-txt-printer-alist', it's the new
   active printer and printing will immediately be done using the new active
   printer.</p>
<p>
   If it's non-nil, the command prompts the user for a new active text printer.</p>
<p>
Note that this command always behaves as if `pr-auto-region' and `pr-auto-mode'
are both set to t.</p>
