<h3>Function: browse-url-firefox</h3>
<p>
Ask the Firefox WWW browser to load URL.
Default to the URL around or before point.  The strings in
variable `browse-url-firefox-arguments' are also passed to
Firefox.</p>
<p>
When called interactively, if variable
`browse-url-new-window-flag' is non-nil, load the document in a
new Firefox window, otherwise use a random existing one.  A
non-nil interactive prefix argument reverses the effect of
`browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
If `browse-url-firefox-new-window-is-tab' is non-nil, then
whenever a document would otherwise be loaded in a new window, it
is loaded in a new tab in an existing window instead.</p>
<p>
When called non-interactively, optional second argument
NEW-WINDOW is used instead of `browse-url-new-window-flag'.</p>
<p>
On MS-Windows systems the optional `new-window' parameter is
ignored.  Firefox for Windows does not support the "-remote"
command line parameter.  Therefore, the
`browse-url-new-window-flag' and `browse-url-firefox-new-window-is-tab'
are ignored as well.  Firefox on Windows will always open the requested
URL in a new window.</p>
