<h3>Function: rgrep</h3>
<p>
Recursively grep for REGEXP in FILES in directory tree rooted at DIR.<br>
The search is limited to file names matching shell pattern FILES.<br>
FILES may use abbreviations defined in `grep-files-aliases', e.g.<br>
entering `ch' is equivalent to `*.[ch]'.<br>
<br>
With C-u prefix, you can edit the constructed shell command line<br>
before it is executed.<br>
With two C-u prefixes, directly edit and run `grep-find-command'.<br>
<br>
Collect output in a buffer.  While the recursive grep is running,<br>
you can use C-x ` (M-x next-error), or <br>
Uses keymap `grep-mode-map', which is not currently defined.<br>
M-x compile-goto-error in the grep output buffer,<br>
to visit the lines where matches were found.  To kill the job<br>
before it finishes, type M-x kill-compilation.<br>
<br>
This command shares argument histories with M-x lgrep and M-x grep-find.<br>
<br>
When called programmatically and FILES is nil, REGEXP is expected
to specify a command to run.
