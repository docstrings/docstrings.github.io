<h3>Function: align-current</h3>
<p>
Call `align' on the current alignment section.<br>
This function assumes you want to align only the current section, and<br>
so saves you from having to specify the region.  If RULES or<br>
EXCLUDE-RULES is set to a list of rules (see `align-rules-list'), it<br>
can be used to override the default alignment rules that would have<br>
been used to align that section.<br>
<br>
(fn &optional RULES EXCLUDE-RULES)</p>
