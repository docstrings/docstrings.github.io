<h3>Variable: window-combination-resize</h3>
<p>
If t, resize window combinations proportionally.
If this variable is nil, splitting a window gets the entire screen space
for displaying the new window from the window to split.  Deleting and
resizing a window preferably resizes one adjacent window only.</p>
<p>
If this variable is t, splitting a window tries to get the space
proportionally from all windows in the same combination.  This also
allows to split a window that is otherwise too small or of fixed size.
Resizing and deleting a window proportionally resize all windows in the
same combination.</p>
<p>
Other values are reserved for future use.</p>
<p>
This variable takes no effect if `window-combination-limit' is non-nil.</p>
