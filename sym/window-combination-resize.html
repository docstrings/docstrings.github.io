<h3>Variable: window-combination-resize</h3>
<p>
If t, resize window combinations proportionally.<br>
If this variable is nil, splitting a window gets the entire screen space<br>
for displaying the new window from the window to split.  Deleting and<br>
resizing a window preferably resizes one adjacent window only.<br>
<br>
If this variable is t, splitting a window tries to get the space<br>
proportionally from all windows in the same combination.  This also<br>
allows to split a window that is otherwise too small or of fixed size.<br>
Resizing and deleting a window proportionally resize all windows in the<br>
same combination.<br>
<br>
Other values are reserved for future use.<br>
<br>
This variable takes no effect if `window-combination-limit' is non-nil.</p>
