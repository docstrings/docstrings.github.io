<h3>Function: define-translation-table</h3>
<p>
Define SYMBOL as the name of translation table made by ARGS.
This sets up information so that the table can be used for
translations in a CCL program.</p>
<p>
If the first element of ARGS is a char-table whose purpose is
`translation-table', just define SYMBOL to name it.  (Note that this
function does not bind SYMBOL.)</p>
<p>
Any other ARGS should be suitable as arguments of the function
`make-translation-table' (which see).</p>
<p>
This function sets properties `translation-table' and
`translation-table-id' of SYMBOL to the created table itself and the
identification number of the table respectively.  It also registers
the table in `translation-table-vector'.</p>
