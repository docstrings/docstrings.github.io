<h3>Function: apropos</h3>
<p>
Show all meaningful Lisp symbols whose names match PATTERN.<br>
Symbols are shown if they are defined as functions, variables, or<br>
faces, or if they have nonempty property lists.<br>
<br>
PATTERN can be a word, a list of words (separated by spaces),<br>
or a regexp (using some regexp special characters).  If it is a word,<br>
search for matches for that word as a substring.  If it is a list of words,<br>
search for matches for any two (or more) of those words.<br>
<br>
With C-u prefix, or if `apropos-do-all' is non-nil,<br>
consider all symbols (if they match PATTERN).<br>
<br>
Returns list of symbols and documentation found.</p>
