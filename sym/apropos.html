<h3>Function: apropos</h3>
<p>
Show all meaningful Lisp symbols whose names match PATTERN.
Symbols are shown if they are defined as functions, variables, or
faces, or if they have nonempty property lists.</p>
<p>
PATTERN can be a word, a list of words (separated by spaces),
or a regexp (using some regexp special characters).  If it is a word,
search for matches for that word as a substring.  If it is a list of words,
search for matches for any two (or more) of those words.</p>
<p>
With C-u prefix, or if `apropos-do-all' is non-nil,
consider all symbols (if they match PATTERN).</p>
<p>
Returns list of symbols and documentation found.</p>
