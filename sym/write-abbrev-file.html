<h3>Function: write-abbrev-file</h3>
<p>
Write all user-level abbrev definitions to a file of Lisp code.
This does not include system abbrevs; it includes only the abbrev tables
listed in listed in `abbrev-table-name-list'.
The file written can be loaded in another session to define the same abbrevs.
The argument FILE is the file name to write.  If omitted or nil, the file
specified in `abbrev-file-name' is used.
If VERBOSE is non-nil, display a message indicating where abbrevs
have been saved.</p>
