<h3>Function: erc-save-buffer-in-logs</h3>
<p>
Append BUFFER contents to the log file, if logging is enabled.<br>
If BUFFER is not provided, current buffer is used.<br>
Logging is enabled if `erc-logging-enabled' returns non-nil.<br>
<br>
This is normally done on exit, to save the unsaved portion of the<br>
buffer, since only the text that runs off the buffer limit is logged<br>
automatically.<br>
<br>
You can save every individual message by putting this function on<br>
`erc-insert-post-hook'.
