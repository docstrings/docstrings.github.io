<h3>Function: erc-save-buffer-in-logs</h3>
<p>
Append BUFFER contents to the log file, if logging is enabled.
If BUFFER is not provided, current buffer is used.
Logging is enabled if `erc-logging-enabled' returns non-nil.</p>
<p>
This is normally done on exit, to save the unsaved portion of the
buffer, since only the text that runs off the buffer limit is logged
automatically.</p>
<p>
You can save every individual message by putting this function on
`erc-insert-post-hook'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional BUFFER)</p>
