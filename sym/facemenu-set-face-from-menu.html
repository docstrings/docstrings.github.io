<h3>Function: facemenu-set-face-from-menu</h3>
<p>
Set the FACE of the region or next character typed.
This function is designed to be called from a menu; FACE is determined
using the event type of the menu entry.  If FACE is a symbol whose
name starts with "fg:" or "bg:", then this functions sets the
foreground or background to the color specified by the rest of the
symbol's name.  Any other symbol is considered the name of a face.</p>
<p>
If the region is active (normally true except in Transient Mark mode)
and there is no prefix argument, this command sets the region to the
requested face.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, this command specifies the face for the next character
inserted.  Moving point or switching buffers before typing a character
to insert cancels the specification.</p>
