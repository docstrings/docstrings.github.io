<h3>Variable: buffer-saved-size</h3>
<p>
Length of current buffer when last read in, saved or auto-saved.
0 initially.
-1 means auto-saving turned off until next real save.</p>
<p>
If you set this to -2, that means don't turn off auto-saving in this buffer
if its text size shrinks.   If you use `buffer-swap-text' on a buffer,
you probably should set this to -2 in that buffer.</p>
