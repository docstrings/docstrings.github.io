<h3>Function: ps-spool-buffer-with-faces</h3>
<p>
Generate and spool a PostScript image of the buffer.<br>
Like `ps-spool-buffer', but includes font, color, and underline information in<br>
the generated image.  This command works only if you are using a window system,<br>
so it has a way to determine color values.<br>
<br>
Use the command `ps-despool' to send the spooled images to the printer.
