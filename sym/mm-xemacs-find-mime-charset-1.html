<h3>Function: mm-xemacs-find-mime-charset-1</h3>
<p>
Determine which MIME charset to use to send region as message.
This uses the XEmacs-specific latin-unity package to better handle the
case where identical characters from diverse ISO-8859-? character sets
can be encoded using a single one of the corresponding coding systems.</p>
<p>
It treats `mm-coding-system-priorities' as the list of preferred
coding systems; a useful example setting for this list in Western
Europe would be '(iso-8859-1 iso-8859-15 utf-8), which would default
to the very standard Latin 1 coding system, and only move to coding
systems that are less supported as is necessary to encode the
characters that exist in the buffer.</p>
<p>
Latin Unity doesn't know about those non-ASCII Roman characters that
are available in various East Asian character sets.  As such, its
behavior if you have a JIS 0212 LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE in a
buffer and it can otherwise be encoded as Latin 1, won't be ideal.
But this is very much a corner case, so don't worry about it.</p>
