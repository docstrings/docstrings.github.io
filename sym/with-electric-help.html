<h3>Function: with-electric-help</h3>
<p>
Pop up an "electric" help buffer.
THUNK is a function of no arguments which is called to initialize the
contents of BUFFER.  BUFFER defaults to `*Help*'.  BUFFER will be
erased before THUNK is called unless NOERASE is non-nil.  THUNK will
be called while BUFFER is current and with `standard-output' bound to
the buffer specified by BUFFER.</p>
<p>
If THUNK returns nil, we display BUFFER starting at the top, and shrink
the window to fit.  If THUNK returns non-nil, we don't do those things.</p>
<p>
After THUNK has been called, this function "electrically" pops up a
window in which BUFFER is displayed and allows the user to scroll
through that buffer in `electric-help-mode'.  The window's height will
be at least MINHEIGHT if this value is non-nil.</p>
<p>
If THUNK returns nil, we display BUFFER starting at the top, and
shrink the window to fit if `electric-help-shrink-window' is non-nil.
If THUNK returns non-nil, we don't do those things.</p>
<p>
When the user exits (with `electric-help-exit', or otherwise), the help
buffer's window disappears (i.e., we use `save-window-excursion'), and
BUFFER is put back into its original major mode.</p>
