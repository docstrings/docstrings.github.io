<h3>Function: keymap-canonicalize</h3>
<p>
Return a simpler equivalent keymap.<br>
This resolves inheritance and redefinitions.  The returned keymap<br>
should behave identically to a copy of KEYMAP w.r.t `lookup-key'<br>
and use in active keymaps and menus.<br>
Subkeymaps may be modified but are not canonicalized.</p>
