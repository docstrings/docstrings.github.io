<h3>Function: keymap-canonicalize</h3>
<p>
Return a simpler equivalent keymap.
This resolves inheritance and redefinitions.  The returned keymap
should behave identically to a copy of KEYMAP w.r.t `lookup-key'
and use in active keymaps and menus.
Subkeymaps may be modified but are not canonicalized.</p>
