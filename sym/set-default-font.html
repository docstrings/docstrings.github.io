<h3>Function: set-default-font</h3>
<p>
Set the default font to FONT.
When called interactively, prompt for the name of a font, and use
that font on the selected frame.  When called from Lisp, FONT
should be a font name (a string), a font object, font entity, or
font spec.</p>
<p>
If KEEP-SIZE is nil, keep the number of frame lines and columns
fixed.  If KEEP-SIZE is non-nil (or with a prefix argument), try
to keep the current frame size fixed (in pixels) by adjusting the
number of lines and columns.</p>
<p>
If FRAMES is nil, apply the font to the selected frame only.
If FRAMES is non-nil, it should be a list of frames to act upon,
or t meaning all graphical frames.  Also, if FRAME is non-nil,
alter the user's Customization settings as though the
font-related attributes of the `default' face had been "set in
this session", so that the font is applied to future frames.</p>
