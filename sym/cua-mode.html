<h3>Function: cua-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle Common User Access style editing (CUA mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable CUA mode if ARG is positive,
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode
if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
CUA mode is a global minor mode.  When enabled, typed text
replaces the active selection, and you can use C-z, C-x, C-c, and
C-v to undo, cut, copy, and paste in addition to the normal Emacs
bindings.  The C-x and C-c keys only do cut and copy when the
region is active, so in most cases, they do not conflict with the
normal function of these prefix keys.</p>
<p>
If you really need to perform a command which starts with one of
the prefix keys even when the region is active, you have three
options:
- press the prefix key twice very quickly (within 0.2 seconds),
- press the prefix key and the following key within 0.2 seconds, or
- use the SHIFT key with the prefix key, i.e. C-S-x or C-S-c.</p>
<p>
You can customize `cua-enable-cua-keys' to completely disable the
CUA bindings, or `cua-prefix-override-inhibit-delay' to change
the prefix fallback behavior.</p>
<p>
CUA mode manages Transient Mark mode internally.  Trying to disable
Transient Mark mode while CUA mode is enabled does not work; if you
only want to highlight the region when it is selected using a
shifted movement key, set `cua-highlight-region-shift-only'.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)</p>
<h3>Variable: cua-mode</h3>
<p>
Non-nil if Cua mode is enabled.
See the command `cua-mode' for a description of this minor mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')
or call the function `cua-mode'.</p>
