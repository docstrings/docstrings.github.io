<h3>Function: set-language-environment</h3>
<p>
Set up multilingual environment for using LANGUAGE-NAME.
This sets the coding system priority and the default input method
and sometimes other things.  LANGUAGE-NAME should be a string
which is the name of a language environment.  For example, "Latin-1"
specifies the character set for the major languages of Western Europe.</p>
<p>
If there is a prior value for `current-language-environment', this
runs the hook `exit-language-environment-hook'.  After setting up
the new language environment, it runs `set-language-environment-hook'.</p>
