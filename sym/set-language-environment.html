<h3>Function: set-language-environment</h3>
<p>
Set up multilingual environment for using LANGUAGE-NAME.<br>
This sets the coding system priority and the default input method<br>
and sometimes other things.  LANGUAGE-NAME should be a string<br>
which is the name of a language environment.  For example, "Latin-1"<br>
specifies the character set for the major languages of Western Europe.<br>
<br>
If there is a prior value for `current-language-environment', this<br>
runs the hook `exit-language-environment-hook'.  After setting up<br>
the new language environment, it runs `set-language-environment-hook'.</p>
