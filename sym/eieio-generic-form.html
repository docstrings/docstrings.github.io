<h3>Function: eieio-generic-form</h3>
<p>
Return the lambda form belonging to METHOD using KEY based upon CLASS.
If CLASS is not a class then use `generic' instead.  If class has
no form, but has a parent class, then trace to that parent class.
The first time a form is requested from a symbol, an optimized path
is memorized for faster future use.</p>
