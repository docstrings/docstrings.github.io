<h3>Function: mm-insert-byte</h3>
<p>
Insert COUNT (second arg) copies of BYTE (first arg).
Both arguments are required.
BYTE is a number of the range 0..255.</p>
<p>
If BYTE is 128..255 and the current buffer is multibyte, the
corresponding eight-bit character is inserted.</p>
<p>
Point, and before-insertion markers, are relocated as in the function `insert'.
The optional third arg INHERIT, if non-nil, says to inherit text properties
from adjoining text, if those properties are sticky.</p>
<p>
(fn BYTE COUNT &optional INHERIT)</p>
