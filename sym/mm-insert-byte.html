<h3>Function: mm-insert-byte</h3>
<p>
Insert COUNT (second arg) copies of BYTE (first arg).<br>
Both arguments are required.<br>
BYTE is a number of the range 0..255.<br>
<br>
If BYTE is 128..255 and the current buffer is multibyte, the<br>
corresponding eight-bit character is inserted.<br>
<br>
Point, and before-insertion markers, are relocated as in the function `insert'.<br>
The optional third arg INHERIT, if non-nil, says to inherit text properties<br>
from adjoining text, if those properties are sticky.

(fn BYTE COUNT &optional INHERIT)</p>
