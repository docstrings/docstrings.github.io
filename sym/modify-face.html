<h3>Function: modify-face</h3>
<p>
Modify attributes of faces interactively.<br>
If optional argument FRAME is nil or omitted, modify the face used<br>
for newly created frame, i.e. the global face.<br>
For non-interactive use, `set-face-attribute' is preferred.<br>
When called from Lisp, if FACE is nil, all arguments but FRAME are ignored<br>
and the face and its settings are obtained by querying the user.</p>
