<h3>Function: info-xref-check-all</h3>
<p>
Check external references in all info documents in the info path.<br>
`Info-directory-list' and `Info-additional-directory-list' are<br>
the info paths.  See `info-xref-check' for how each file is<br>
checked.<br>
<br>
The search for "all" info files is rather permissive, since<br>
info files don't necessarily have a ".info" extension and in<br>
particular the Emacs manuals normally don't.  If you have a<br>
source code directory in `Info-directory-list' then a lot of<br>
extraneous files might be read.  This will be time consuming but
should be harmless.
