<h3>Function: info-xref-check-all</h3>
<p>
Check external references in all info documents in the info path.
`Info-directory-list' and `Info-additional-directory-list' are
the info paths.  See `info-xref-check' for how each file is
checked.</p>
<p>
The search for "all" info files is rather permissive, since
info files don't necessarily have a ".info" extension and in
particular the Emacs manuals normally don't.  If you have a
source code directory in `Info-directory-list' then a lot of
extraneous files might be read.  This will be time consuming but
should be harmless.</p>
