<h3>Function: transpose-regions</h3>
<p>
Transpose region STARTR1 to ENDR1 with STARTR2 to ENDR2.
The regions should not be overlapping, because the size of the buffer is
never changed in a transposition.</p>
<p>
Optional fifth arg LEAVE-MARKERS, if non-nil, means don't update
any markers that happen to be located in the regions.</p>
<p>
Transposing beyond buffer boundaries is an error.</p>
