<h3>Function: transpose-regions</h3>
<p>
Transpose region STARTR1 to ENDR1 with STARTR2 to ENDR2.<br>
The regions should not be overlapping, because the size of the buffer is<br>
never changed in a transposition.<br>
<br>
Optional fifth arg LEAVE-MARKERS, if non-nil, means don't update<br>
any markers that happen to be located in the regions.<br>
<br>
Transposing beyond buffer boundaries is an error.<br>
<br>
(fn STARTR1 ENDR1 STARTR2 ENDR2 &optional LEAVE-MARKERS)</p>
