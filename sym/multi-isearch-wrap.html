<h3>Function: multi-isearch-wrap</h3>
<p>
Wrap the multiple buffers search when search is failed.
Switch buffer to the first buffer for a forward search,
or to the last buffer for a backward search.
Set `multi-isearch-current-buffer' to the current buffer to display
the isearch suffix message [initial buffer] only when isearch leaves
the initial buffer.</p>
