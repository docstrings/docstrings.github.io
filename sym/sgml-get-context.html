<h3>Function: sgml-get-context</h3>
<p>
Determine the context of the current position.<br>
By default, parse until we find a start-tag as the first thing on a line.<br>
If UNTIL is `empty', return even if the context is empty (i.e.<br>
we just skipped over some element and got to a beginning of line).<br>
<br>
The context is a list of tag-info structures.  The last one is the tag<br>
immediately enclosing the current position.<br>
<br>
Point is assumed to be outside of any tag.  If we discover that it's<br>
not the case, the first tag returned is the one inside which we are.</p>
