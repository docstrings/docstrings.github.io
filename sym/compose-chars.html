<h3>Function: compose-chars</h3>
<p>
Return a string from arguments in which all characters are composed.
For relative composition, arguments are characters.
For rule-based composition, Mth (where M is odd) arguments are
characters, and Nth (where N is even) arguments are composition rules.
A composition rule is a cons of glyph reference points of the form
(GLOBAL-REF-POINT . NEW-REF-POINT).  See the documentation of
`reference-point-alist' for more detail.</p>
