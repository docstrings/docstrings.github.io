<h3>Function: delete-frame</h3>
<p>
Delete FRAME, permanently eliminating it from use.<br>
FRAME defaults to the selected frame.<br>
<br>
A frame may not be deleted if its minibuffer is used by other frames.<br>
Normally, you may not delete a frame if all other frames are invisible,<br>
but if the second optional argument FORCE is non-nil, you may do so.<br>
<br>
This function runs `delete-frame-functions' before actually<br>
deleting the frame, unless the frame is a tooltip.<br>
The functions are run with one argument, the frame to be deleted.

(fn &optional FRAME FORCE)</p>
