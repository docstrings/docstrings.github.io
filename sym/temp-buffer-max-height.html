<h3>Variable: temp-buffer-max-height</h3>
<p>
Maximum height of a window displaying a temporary buffer.<br>
This is effective only when Temp Buffer Resize mode is enabled.<br>
The value is the maximum height (in lines) which<br>
`resize-temp-buffer-window' will give to a window displaying a<br>
temporary buffer.  It can also be a function to be called to<br>
choose the height for such a buffer.  It gets one argument, the<br>
buffer, and should return a positive integer.  At the time the<br>
function is called, the window to be resized is selected.</p>
