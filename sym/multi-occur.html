<h3>Function: multi-occur</h3>
<p>
Show all lines in buffers BUFS containing a match for REGEXP.
This function acts on multiple buffers; otherwise, it is exactly like
`occur'.  When you invoke this command interactively, you must specify
the buffer names that you want, one by one.
See also `multi-occur-in-matching-buffers'.</p>
