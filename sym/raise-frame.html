<h3>Function: raise-frame</h3>
<p>
Bring FRAME to the front, so it occludes any frames it overlaps.
If FRAME is invisible or iconified, make it visible.
If you don't specify a frame, the selected frame is used.
If Emacs is displaying on an ordinary terminal or some other device which
doesn't support multiple overlapping frames, this function selects FRAME.</p>
