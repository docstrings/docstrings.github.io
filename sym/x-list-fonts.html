<h3>Function: x-list-fonts</h3>
<p>
Return a list of the names of available fonts matching PATTERN.
If optional arguments FACE and FRAME are specified, return only fonts
the same size as FACE on FRAME.</p>
<p>
PATTERN should be a string containing a font name in the XLFD,
Fontconfig, or GTK format.  A font name given in the XLFD format may
contain wildcard characters:
  the * character matches any substring, and
  the ? character matches any single character.
  PATTERN is case-insensitive.</p>
<p>
The return value is a list of strings, suitable as arguments to
`set-face-font'.</p>
<p>
Fonts Emacs can't use may or may not be excluded
even if they match PATTERN and FACE.
The optional fourth argument MAXIMUM sets a limit on how many
fonts to match.  The first MAXIMUM fonts are reported.
The optional fifth argument WIDTH, if specified, is a number of columns
occupied by a character of a font.  In that case, return only fonts
the WIDTH times as wide as FACE on FRAME.</p>
