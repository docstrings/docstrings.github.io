<h3>Variable: grep-command</h3>
<p>
The default grep command for M-x grep.<br>
If the grep program used supports an option to always include file names<br>
in its output (such as the `-H' option to GNU grep), it's a good idea to<br>
include it when specifying `grep-command'.<br>
<br>
In interactive usage, the actual value of this variable is set up<br>
by `grep-compute-defaults'; to change the default value, use<br>
Customize or call the function `grep-apply-setting'.</p>
