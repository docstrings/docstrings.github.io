<h3>Variable: font-lock-beginning-of-syntax-function</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means use this function to move back outside all constructs.<br>
When called with no args it should move point backward to a place which<br>
is not in a string or comment and not within any bracket-pairs (or else,<br>
a place such that any bracket-pairs outside it can be ignored for Emacs<br>
syntax analysis and fontification).<br>
<br>
If this is nil, Font Lock uses `syntax-begin-function' to move back<br>
outside of any comment, string, or sexp.  This variable is semi-obsolete;<br>
we recommend setting `syntax-begin-function' instead.<br>
<br>
This is normally set via `font-lock-defaults'.</p>
