<h3>Variable: font-lock-beginning-of-syntax-function</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means use this function to move back outside all constructs.
When called with no args it should move point backward to a place which
is not in a string or comment and not within any bracket-pairs (or else,
a place such that any bracket-pairs outside it can be ignored for Emacs
syntax analysis and fontification).</p>
<p>
If this is nil, Font Lock uses `syntax-begin-function' to move back
outside of any comment, string, or sexp.  This variable is semi-obsolete;
we recommend setting `syntax-begin-function' instead.</p>
<p>
This is normally set via `font-lock-defaults'.</p>
