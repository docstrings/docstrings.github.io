<h3>Function: mark-whole-buffer</h3>
<p>
Put point at beginning and mark at end of buffer.<br>
If narrowing is in effect, only uses the accessible part of the buffer.<br>
You probably should not use this function in Lisp programs;<br>
it is usually a mistake for a Lisp function to use any subroutine<br>
that uses or sets the mark.</p>
