<h3>Function: encode-coding-string</h3>
<p>
Encode STRING to CODING-SYSTEM, and return the result.</p>
<p>
Optional third arg NOCOPY non-nil means it is OK to return STRING
itself if the encoding operation is trivial.</p>
<p>
Optional fourth arg BUFFER non-nil means that the encoded text is
inserted in that buffer after point (point does not move).  In this
case, the return value is the length of the encoded text.</p>
<p>
This function sets `last-coding-system-used' to the precise coding system
used (which may be different from CODING-SYSTEM if CODING-SYSTEM is
not fully specified.)</p>
<p>
