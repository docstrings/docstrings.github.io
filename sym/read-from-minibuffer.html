<h3>Function: read-from-minibuffer</h3>
<p>
Read a string from the minibuffer, prompting with string PROMPT.
The optional second arg INITIAL-CONTENTS is an obsolete alternative to
  DEFAULT-VALUE.  It normally should be nil in new code, except when
  HIST is a cons.  It is discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p>
Third arg KEYMAP is a keymap to use whilst reading;
  if omitted or nil, the default is `minibuffer-local-map'.</p>
<p>
If fourth arg READ is non-nil, interpret the result as a Lisp object
  and return that object:
  in other words, do `(car (read-from-string INPUT-STRING))'</p>
<p>
Fifth arg HIST, if non-nil, specifies a history list and optionally
  the initial position in the list.  It can be a symbol, which is the
  history list variable to use, or a cons cell (HISTVAR . HISTPOS).
  In that case, HISTVAR is the history list variable to use, and
  HISTPOS is the initial position for use by the minibuffer history
  commands.  For consistency, you should also specify that element of
  the history as the value of INITIAL-CONTENTS.  Positions are counted
  starting from 1 at the beginning of the list.</p>
<p>
Sixth arg DEFAULT-VALUE, if non-nil, should be a string, which is used
  as the default to `read' if READ is non-nil and the user enters
  empty input.  But if READ is nil, this function does _not_ return
  DEFAULT-VALUE for empty input!  Instead, it returns the empty string.</p>
<p>
  Whatever the value of READ, DEFAULT-VALUE is made available via the
  minibuffer history commands.  DEFAULT-VALUE can also be a list of
  strings, in which case all the strings are available in the history,
  and the first string is the default to `read' if READ is non-nil.</p>
<p>
Seventh arg INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD, if non-nil, means the minibuffer inherits
 the current input method and the setting of `enable-multibyte-characters'.</p>
<p>
If the variable `minibuffer-allow-text-properties' is non-nil,
 then the string which is returned includes whatever text properties
 were present in the minibuffer.  Otherwise the value has no text properties.</p>
<p>
The remainder of this documentation string describes the
INITIAL-CONTENTS argument in more detail.  It is only relevant when
studying existing code, or when HIST is a cons.  If non-nil,
INITIAL-CONTENTS is a string to be inserted into the minibuffer before
reading input.  Normally, point is put at the end of that string.
However, if INITIAL-CONTENTS is (STRING . POSITION), the initial
input is STRING, but point is placed at _one-indexed_ position
POSITION in the minibuffer.  Any integer value less than or equal to
one puts point at the beginning of the string.  *Note* that this
behavior differs from the way such arguments are used in `completing-read'
and some related functions, which use zero-indexing for POSITION.</p>
