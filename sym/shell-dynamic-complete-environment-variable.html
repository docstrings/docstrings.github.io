<h3>Function: shell-dynamic-complete-environment-variable</h3>
<p>
Dynamically complete the environment variable at point.
Completes if after a variable, i.e., if it starts with a "$".</p>
<p>
This function is similar to `comint-dynamic-complete-filename', except that it
searches `process-environment' for completion candidates.  Note that this may
not be the same as the interpreter's idea of variable names.  The main problem
with this type of completion is that `process-environment' is the environment
which Emacs started with.  Emacs does not track changes to the environment made
by the interpreter.  Perhaps it would be more accurate if this function was
called `shell-dynamic-complete-process-environment-variable'.</p>
<p>
Returns non-nil if successful.</p>
