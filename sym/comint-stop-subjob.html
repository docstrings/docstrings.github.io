<h3>Function: comint-stop-subjob</h3>
<p>
Stop the current subjob.
This command also kills the pending input
between the process mark and point.</p>
<p>
WARNING: if there is no current subjob, you can end up suspending
the top-level process running in the buffer.  If you accidentally do
this, use M-x comint-continue-subjob to resume the process.  (This
is not a problem with most shells, since they ignore this signal.)</p>
