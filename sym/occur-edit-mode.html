<h3>Function: occur-edit-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for editing *Occur* buffers.
In this mode, changes to the *Occur* buffer are also applied to
the originating buffer.</p>
<p>
To return to ordinary Occur mode, use M-x occur-cease-edit.</p>
<p>
In addition to any hooks its parent mode `occur-mode' might have run,
this mode runs the hook `occur-edit-mode-hook', as the final step
during initialization.</p>
