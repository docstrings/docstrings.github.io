<h3>Variable: auto-mode-case-fold</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means to try second pass through `auto-mode-alist'.
This means that if the first case-sensitive search through the alist fails
to find a matching major mode, a second case-insensitive search is made.
On systems with case-insensitive file names, this variable is ignored,
since only a single case-insensitive search through the alist is made.</p>
