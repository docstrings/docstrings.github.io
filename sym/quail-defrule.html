<h3>Function: quail-defrule</h3>
<p>
Add one translation rule, KEY to TRANSLATION, in the current Quail package.
KEY is a string meaning a sequence of keystrokes to be translated.
TRANSLATION is a character, a string, a vector, a Quail map,
 a function, or a cons.
It it is a character, it is the sole translation of KEY.
If it is a string, each character is a candidate for the translation.
If it is a vector, each element (string or character) is a candidate
 for the translation.
If it is a cons, the car is one of the above and the cdr is a function
 to call when translating KEY (the return value is assigned to the
 variable `quail-current-data').  If the cdr part is not a function,
 the value itself is assigned to `quail-current-data'.
In these cases, a key specific Quail map is generated and assigned to KEY.</p>
<p>
If TRANSLATION is a Quail map or a function symbol which returns a Quail map,
 it is used to handle KEY.</p>
<p>
Optional 3rd argument NAME, if specified, says which Quail package
to define this translation rule in.  The default is to define it in the
current Quail package.</p>
<p>
Optional 4th argument APPEND, if non-nil, appends TRANSLATION
to the current translations for KEY instead of replacing them.</p>
