<h3>Variable: tramp-completion-file-name-regexp</h3>
<p>
Regular expression matching file names handled by Tramp completion.<br>
This regexp should match partial Tramp file names only.<br>

this file (tramp.el) is loaded.  This means that this variable must be set<br>
before loading tramp.el.  Alternatively, `file-name-handler-alist' can be<br>
updated after changing this variable.<br>
