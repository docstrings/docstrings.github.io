<h3>Variable: tramp-completion-file-name-regexp</h3>
<p>
Regular expression matching file names handled by Tramp completion.
This regexp should match partial Tramp file names only.</p>
<p>
Please note that the entry in `file-name-handler-alist' is made when
this file (tramp.el) is loaded.  This means that this variable must be set
before loading tramp.el.  Alternatively, `file-name-handler-alist' can be
updated after changing this variable.</p>
