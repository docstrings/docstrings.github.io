<h3>Variable: x-resource-name</h3>
<p>
The name Emacs uses to look up X resources.<br>
`x-get-resource' uses this as the first component of the instance name<br>
when requesting resource values.<br>
Emacs initially sets `x-resource-name' to the name under which Emacs<br>
was invoked, or to the value specified with the `-name' or `-rn'<br>
switches, if present.<br>
<br>
It may be useful to bind this variable locally around a call<br>
to `x-get-resource'.  See also the variable `x-resource-class'.</p>
