<h3>Variable: x-resource-name</h3>
<p>
The name Emacs uses to look up X resources.
`x-get-resource' uses this as the first component of the instance name
when requesting resource values.
Emacs initially sets `x-resource-name' to the name under which Emacs
was invoked, or to the value specified with the `-name' or `-rn'
switches, if present.</p>
<p>
It may be useful to bind this variable locally around a call
to `x-get-resource'.  See also the variable `x-resource-class'.</p>
