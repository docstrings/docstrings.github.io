<h3>Function: outline-mode</h3>
<p>
Set major mode for editing outlines with selective display.<br>
Headings are lines which start with asterisks: one for major headings,<br>
two for subheadings, etc.  Lines not starting with asterisks are body lines.<br>
<br>
Body text or subheadings under a heading can be made temporarily<br>
invisible, or visible again.  Invisible lines are attached to the end<br>
of the heading, so they move with it, if the line is killed and yanked<br>
back.  A heading with text hidden under it is marked with an ellipsis (...).<br>
<br>

M-x hide-entry	   make immediately following body invisible.<br>
M-x show-entry	   make it visible.<br>
M-x hide-leaves	   make body under heading and under its subheadings invisible.<br>
		     The subheadings remain visible.<br>
M-x show-branches  make all subheadings at all levels visible.<br>
<br>
The variable `outline-regexp' can be changed to control what is a heading.<br>
A line is a heading if `outline-regexp' matches something at the<br>
beginning of the line.  The longer the match, the deeper the level.

Turning on outline mode calls the value of `text-mode-hook' and then of
`outline-mode-hook', if they are non-nil.
