<h3>Variable: after-init-hook</h3>
<p>
Normal hook run after initializing the Emacs session.
It is run after Emacs loads the init file, `default' library, the
abbrevs file, and additional Lisp packages (if any), and setting
the value of `after-init-time'.</p>
<p>
There is no `condition-case' around the running of this hook;
therefore, if `debug-on-error' is non-nil, an error in one of
these functions will invoke the debugger.</p>
