<h3>Variable: facemenu-keybindings</h3>
<p>
Alist of interesting faces and keybindings.
Each element is itself a list: the car is the name of the face,
the next element is the key to use as a keyboard equivalent of the menu item;
the binding is made in `facemenu-keymap'.</p>
<p>
The faces specifically mentioned in this list are put at the top of
the menu, in the order specified.  All other faces which are defined
in `facemenu-listed-faces' are listed after them, but get no
keyboard equivalents.</p>
<p>
If you change this variable after loading facemenu.el, you will need to call
`facemenu-update' to make it take effect.</p>
