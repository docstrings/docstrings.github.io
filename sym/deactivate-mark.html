<h3>Function: deactivate-mark</h3>
<p>
Deactivate the mark.<br>
If Transient Mark mode is disabled, this function normally does<br>
nothing; but if FORCE is non-nil, it deactivates the mark anyway.<br>
<br>
Deactivating the mark sets `mark-active' to nil, updates the<br>
primary selection according to `select-active-regions', and runs<br>
`deactivate-mark-hook'.<br>
<br>
If Transient Mark mode was temporarily enabled, reset the value<br>
of the variable `transient-mark-mode'; if this causes Transient<br>
Mark mode to be disabled, don't change `mark-active' to nil or
run `deactivate-mark-hook'.</p>
<h3>Variable: deactivate-mark</h3>
<p>
If an editing command sets this to t, deactivate the mark afterward.<br>
The command loop sets this to nil before each command,<br>
and tests the value when the command returns.<br>
Buffer modification stores t in this variable.</p>
