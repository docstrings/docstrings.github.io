<h3>Function: accessible-keymaps</h3>
<p>
Find all keymaps accessible via prefix characters from KEYMAP.
Returns a list of elements of the form (KEYS . MAP), where the sequence
KEYS starting from KEYMAP gets you to MAP.  These elements are ordered
so that the KEYS increase in length.  The first element is ([] . KEYMAP).
An optional argument PREFIX, if non-nil, should be a key sequence;
then the value includes only maps for prefixes that start with PREFIX.</p>
