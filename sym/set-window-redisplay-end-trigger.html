<h3>Function: set-window-redisplay-end-trigger</h3>
<p>
Set WINDOW's redisplay end trigger value to VALUE.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.  VALUE
should be a buffer position (typically a marker) or nil.  If it is a
buffer position, then if redisplay in WINDOW reaches a position beyond
VALUE, the functions in `redisplay-end-trigger-functions' are called
with two arguments: WINDOW, and the end trigger value.  Afterwards the
end-trigger value is reset to nil.</p>
