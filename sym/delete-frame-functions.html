<h3>Variable: delete-frame-functions</h3>
<p>
Functions run before deleting a frame.<br>
The functions are run with one arg, the frame to be deleted.<br>
See `delete-frame'.<br>
<br>
Note that functions in this list may be called just before the frame is<br>
actually deleted, or some time later (or even both when an earlier function<br>
in `delete-frame-functions' (indirectly) calls `delete-frame'
recursively).</p>
