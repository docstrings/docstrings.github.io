<h3>Variable: delete-frame-functions</h3>
<p>
Functions run before deleting a frame.
The functions are run with one arg, the frame to be deleted.
See `delete-frame'.</p>
<p>
Note that functions in this list may be called just before the frame is
actually deleted, or some time later (or even both when an earlier function
in `delete-frame-functions' (indirectly) calls `delete-frame'
recursively).</p>
