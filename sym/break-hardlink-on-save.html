<h3>Variable: break-hardlink-on-save</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means when saving a file that exists under several names<br>
(i.e., has multiple hardlinks), break the hardlink associated with<br>
`buffer-file-name' and write to a new file, so that the other<br>
instances of the file are not affected by the save.<br>
<br>
If `buffer-file-name' refers to a symlink, do not break the symlink.<br>
<br>
Unlike `file-precious-flag', `break-hardlink-on-save' is not advisory.<br>
For example, if the directory in which a file is being saved is not<br>
itself writable, then error instead of saving in some<br>
hardlink-nonbreaking way.<br>
<br>
See also `backup-by-copying' and `backup-by-copying-when-linked'.</p>
