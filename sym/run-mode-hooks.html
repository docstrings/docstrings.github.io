<h3>Function: run-mode-hooks</h3>
<p>
Run mode hooks `delayed-mode-hooks' and HOOKS, or delay HOOKS.
If the variable `delay-mode-hooks' is non-nil, does not run any hooks,
just adds the HOOKS to the list `delayed-mode-hooks'.
Otherwise, runs hooks in the sequence: `change-major-mode-after-body-hook',
`delayed-mode-hooks' (in reverse order), HOOKS, and finally
`after-change-major-mode-hook'.  Major mode functions should use
this instead of `run-hooks' when running their FOO-mode-hook.</p>
