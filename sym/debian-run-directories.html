<h3>Function: debian-run-directories</h3>
<p>
Load each file of the form XXfilename.el or XXfilename.elc in any<br>
of the dirs, where XX must be a number.  The files will be run in<br>
alphabetical order.  If a file appears in more than one of the dirs,<br>
then the earlier dir takes precedence, and a .elc file always<br>
supercedes a .el file of the same name.</p>
