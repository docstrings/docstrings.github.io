<h3>Function: debian-run-directories</h3>
<p>
Load each file of the form XXfilename.el or XXfilename.elc in any
of the dirs, where XX must be a number.  The files will be run in
alphabetical order.  If a file appears in more than one of the dirs,
then the earlier dir takes precedence, and a .elc file always
supercedes a .el file of the same name.</p>
