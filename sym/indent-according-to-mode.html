<h3>Function: indent-according-to-mode</h3>
<p>
Indent line in proper way for current major mode.
Normally, this is done by calling the function specified by the
variable `indent-line-function'.  However, if the value of that
variable is `indent-relative' or `indent-relative-maybe', handle
it specially (since those functions are used for tabbing); in
that case, indent by aligning to the previous non-blank line.</p>
