<h3>Function: indent-according-to-mode</h3>
<p>
Indent line in proper way for current major mode.<br>
Normally, this is done by calling the function specified by the<br>
variable `indent-line-function'.  However, if the value of that<br>
variable is `indent-relative' or `indent-relative-maybe', handle<br>
it specially (since those functions are used for tabbing); in<br>
that case, indent by aligning to the previous non-blank line.</p>
