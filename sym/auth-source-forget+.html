<h3>Function: auth-source-forget+</h3>
<p>
Forget any cached data matching SPEC.  Returns forgotten count.<br>
<br>
This is not a full `auth-source-search' spec but works similarly.<br>
For instance, (:host "myhost" "yourhost") would find all the<br>
cached data that was found with a search for those two hosts,<br>
while (:host t) would find all host entries.<br>
<br>
(fn &rest SPEC &allow-other-keys)</p>
