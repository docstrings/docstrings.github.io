<h3>Function: auth-source-forget+</h3>
<p>
Forget any cached data matching SPEC.  Returns forgotten count.</p>
<p>
This is not a full `auth-source-search' spec but works similarly.
For instance, (:host "myhost" "yourhost") would find all the
cached data that was found with a search for those two hosts,
while (:host t) would find all host entries.</p>

(fn &rest SPEC &allow-other-keys)</p>
