<h3>Function: t-mouse-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle mouse support in GNU/Linux consoles (GPM Mouse mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable GPM Mouse mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
This allows the use of the mouse when operating on a GNU/Linux console,
in the same way as you can use the mouse under X11.
It relies on the `gpm' daemon being activated.</p>
