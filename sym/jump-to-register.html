<h3>Function: jump-to-register</h3>
<p>
Move point to location stored in a register.<br>
If the register contains a file name, find that file.<br>

If the register contains a window configuration (one frame) or a frame<br>
configuration (all frames), restore that frame or all frames accordingly.<br>
First argument is a character, naming the register.<br>
Optional second arg non-nil (interactively, prefix argument) says to<br>
delete any existing frames that the frame configuration doesn't mention.<br>
(Otherwise, these frames are iconified.)</p>
