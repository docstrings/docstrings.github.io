<h3>Variable: isearch-search-fun-function</h3>
<p>
Non-default value overrides the behavior of `isearch-search-fun-default'.<br>
This variable's value should be a function, which will be called<br>
with no arguments, and should return a function that takes three<br>
arguments: STRING, BOUND, and NOERROR.<br>
<br>
This returned function will be used by `isearch-search-string' to<br>
search for the first occurrence of STRING or its translation.</p>
