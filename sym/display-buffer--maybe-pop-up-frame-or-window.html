<h3>Function: display-buffer--maybe-pop-up-frame-or-window</h3>
<p>
Try displaying BUFFER based on `pop-up-frames' or `pop-up-windows'.</p>
<p>
If `pop-up-frames' is non-nil (and not `graphic-only' on a
text-only terminal), try with `display-buffer-pop-up-frame'.</p>
<p>
If that cannot be done, and `pop-up-windows' is non-nil, try
again with `display-buffer-pop-up-window'.</p>
