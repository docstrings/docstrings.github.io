<h3>Function: move-to-column</h3>
<p>
Move point to column COLUMN in the current line.
Interactively, COLUMN is the value of prefix numeric argument.
The column of a character is calculated by adding together the widths
as displayed of the previous characters in the line.
This function ignores line-continuation;
there is no upper limit on the column number a character can have
and horizontal scrolling has no effect.</p>
<p>
If specified column is within a character, point goes after that character.
If it's past end of line, point goes to end of line.</p>
<p>
Optional second argument FORCE non-nil means if COLUMN is in the
middle of a tab character, change it to spaces.
In addition, if FORCE is t, and the line is too short to reach
COLUMN, add spaces/tabs to get there.</p>
<p>
The return value is the current column.</p>
