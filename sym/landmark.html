<h3>Function: landmark</h3>
<p>
Start or resume an Landmark game.
If a game is in progress, this command allows you to resume it.
Here is the relation between prefix args and game options:</p>
<p>
prefix arg | robot is auto-started | weights are saved from last game
---------------------------------------------------------------------
none / 1   | yes                   | no
       2   | yes                   | yes
       3   | no                    | yes
       4   | no                    | no</p>
<p>
You start by moving to a square and typing M-x landmark-start-robot,
if you did not use a prefix arg to ask for automatic start.
Use C-h m for more info.</p>
