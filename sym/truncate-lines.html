<h3>Variable: truncate-lines</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means do not display continuation lines.
Instead, give each line of text just one screen line.</p>
<p>
Note that this is overridden by the variable
`truncate-partial-width-windows' if that variable is non-nil
and this buffer is not full-frame width.</p>
<p>
Minibuffers set this variable to nil.</p>
