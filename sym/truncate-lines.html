<h3>Variable: truncate-lines</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means do not display continuation lines.<br>
Instead, give each line of text just one screen line.<br>
<br>
Note that this is overridden by the variable<br>
`truncate-partial-width-windows' if that variable is non-nil<br>
and this buffer is not full-frame width.<br>
<br>
Minibuffers set this variable to nil.</p>
