<h3>Function: custom-theme-set-faces</h3>
<p>
Initialize faces for theme THEME.
The arguments should be a list where each entry has the form:</p>
<p>
  (FACE SPEC [NOW [COMMENT]])</p>
<p>
SPEC is stored as the saved value for FACE, as well as the value for the
`user' theme.  The `user' theme is one of the default themes known to Emacs.
See `custom-known-themes' for more information on the known themes.
See `custom-theme-set-faces' for more information on the interplay
between themes and faces.
See `defface' for the format of SPEC.</p>
<p>
If NOW is present and non-nil, FACE is created now, according to SPEC.
COMMENT is a string comment about FACE.</p>
<p>
Several properties of THEME and FACE are used in the process:</p>
<p>
If THEME property `theme-immediate' is non-nil, this is equivalent of
providing the NOW argument to all faces in the argument list: FACE is
created now.  The only difference is FACE property `force-face': if NOW
is non-nil, FACE property `force-face' is set to the symbol `rogue', else
if THEME property `theme-immediate' is non-nil, FACE property `force-face'
is set to the symbol `immediate'.</p>
<p>
SPEC itself is saved in FACE property `saved-face' and it is stored in
FACE's list property `theme-face' (using `custom-push-theme').</p>
