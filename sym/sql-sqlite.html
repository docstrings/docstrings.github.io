<h3>Function: sql-sqlite</h3>
<p>
Run sqlite as an inferior process.</p>
<p>
SQLite is free software.</p>
<p>
If buffer `*SQL*' exists but no process is running, make a new process.
If buffer exists and a process is running, just switch to buffer
`*SQL*'.</p>
<p>
Interpreter used comes from variable `sql-sqlite-program'.  Login uses
the variables `sql-user', `sql-password', `sql-database', and
`sql-server' as defaults, if set.  Additional command line parameters
can be stored in the list `sql-sqlite-options'.</p>
<p>
The buffer is put in SQL interactive mode, giving commands for sending
input.  See `sql-interactive-mode'.</p>
<p>
To set the buffer name directly, use C-u
before M-x sql-sqlite.  Once session has started,
M-x sql-rename-buffer can be called separately to rename the
buffer.</p>
<p>
To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the input and output to the process, use C-x RET c
before M-x sql-sqlite.  You can also specify this with C-x RET p
in the SQL buffer, after you start the process.
The default comes from `process-coding-system-alist' and
`default-process-coding-system'.</p>
<p>
(Type C-h m in the SQL buffer for a list of commands.)</p>
