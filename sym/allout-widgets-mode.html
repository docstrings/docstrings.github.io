<h3>Function: allout-widgets-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle Allout Widgets mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Allout Widgets mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Allout Widgets mode is an extension of Allout mode that provides
graphical decoration of outline structure.  It is meant to
operate along with `allout-mode', via `allout-mode-hook'.</p>
<p>
The graphics include:</p>
<p>
- guide lines connecting item bullet-icons with those of their subitems.</p>
<p>
- icons for item bullets, varying to indicate whether or not the item
  has subitems, and if so, whether or not the item is expanded.</p>
<p>
- cue area between the bullet-icon and the start of the body headline,
  for item numbering, encryption indicator, and distinctive bullets.</p>
<p>
The bullet-icon and guide line graphics provide keybindings and mouse
bindings for easy outline navigation and exposure control, extending
outline hot-spot navigation (see `allout-mode').</p>
