<h3>Function: custom-reevaluate-setting</h3>
<p>
Reset the value of SYMBOL by re-evaluating its saved or standard value.
Use the :set function to do so.  This is useful for customizable options
that are defined before their standard value can really be computed.
E.g. dumped variables whose default depends on run-time information.</p>
