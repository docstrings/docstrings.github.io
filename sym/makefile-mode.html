<h3>Function: makefile-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for editing standard Makefiles.<br>
<br>
If you are editing a file for a different make, try one of the<br>
variants `makefile-automake-mode', `makefile-gmake-mode',<br>
`makefile-makepp-mode', `makefile-bsdmake-mode' or,<br>
`makefile-imake-mode'.  All but the last should be correctly<br>
chosen based on the file name, except if it is *.mk.  This<br>
function ends by invoking the function(s) `makefile-mode-hook'.<br>
<br>
It is strongly recommended to use `font-lock-mode', because that<br>
provides additional parsing information.  This is used for<br>
example to see that a rule action `echo foo: bar' is a not rule<br>
dependency, despite the colon.<br>
<br>
<br>
Uses keymap `makefile-mode-map', which is not currently defined.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the browser, use the following keys:<br>
<br>
<br>
Uses keymap `makefile-browser-map', which is not currently defined.<br>
<br>
<br>
Makefile mode can be configured by modifying the following variables:<br>
<br>
`makefile-browser-buffer-name':<br>
    Name of the macro- and target browser buffer.<br>
<br>
`makefile-target-colon':<br>
    The string that gets appended to all target names<br>
    inserted by `makefile-insert-target'.<br>
    ":" or "::" are quite common values.<br>
<br>
`makefile-macro-assign':<br>
   The string that gets appended to all macro names<br>
   inserted by `makefile-insert-macro'.<br>
   The normal value should be " = ", since this is what<br>
   standard make expects.  However, newer makes such as dmake<br>
   allow a larger variety of different macro assignments, so you<br>
   might prefer to use " += " or " := " .<br>
<br>
`makefile-tab-after-target-colon':<br>
   If you want a TAB (instead of a space) to be appended after the<br>
   target colon, then set this to a non-nil value.<br>
<br>
`makefile-browser-leftmost-column':<br>
   Number of blanks to the left of the browser selection mark.<br>
<br>
`makefile-browser-cursor-column':<br>
   Column in which the cursor is positioned when it moves<br>
   up or down in the browser.<br>
<br>
`makefile-browser-selected-mark':<br>
   String used to mark selected entries in the browser.<br>
<br>
`makefile-browser-unselected-mark':<br>
   String used to mark unselected entries in the browser.<br>
<br>
`makefile-browser-auto-advance-after-selection-p':<br>
   If this variable is set to a non-nil value the cursor<br>
   will automagically advance to the next line after an item<br>
   has been selected in the browser.<br>
<br>
`makefile-pickup-everything-picks-up-filenames-p':<br>
   If this variable is set to a non-nil value then<br>
   `makefile-pickup-everything' also picks up filenames as targets<br>
   (i.e. it calls `makefile-pickup-filenames-as-targets'), otherwise<br>
   filenames are omitted.<br>
<br>
`makefile-cleanup-continuations':<br>
   If this variable is set to a non-nil value then Makefile mode<br>
   will assure that no line in the file ends with a backslash<br>
   (the continuation character) followed by any whitespace.<br>
   This is done by silently removing the trailing whitespace, leaving<br>
   the backslash itself intact.<br>
   IMPORTANT: Please note that enabling this option causes Makefile mode<br>
   to MODIFY A FILE WITHOUT YOUR CONFIRMATION when "it seems necessary".<br>
<br>
`makefile-browser-hook':<br>
   A function or list of functions to be called just before the
   browser is entered. This is executed in the makefile buffer.

`makefile-special-targets-list':
   List of special targets. You will be offered to complete
   on one of those in the minibuffer whenever you enter a `.'.
   at the beginning of a line in Makefile mode.
