<h3>Function: x-selection-exists-p</h3>
<p>
Whether there is an owner for the given X selection.
SELECTION should be the name of the selection in question, typically
one of the symbols `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', `CLIPBOARD', or
`CLIPBOARD_MANAGER' (X expects these literal upper-case names.)  The
symbol nil is the same as `PRIMARY', and t is the same as `SECONDARY'.</p>
<p>
TERMINAL should be a terminal object or a frame specifying the X
server to query.  If omitted or nil, that stands for the selected
frame's display, or the first available X display.</p>
<p>
On Nextstep, TERMINAL is unused.</p>
