<h3>Function: fill-individual-paragraphs</h3>
<p>
Fill paragraphs of uniform indentation within the region.
This command divides the region into "paragraphs",
treating every change in indentation level or prefix as a paragraph boundary,
then fills each paragraph using its indentation level as the fill prefix.</p>
<p>
There is one special case where a change in indentation does not start
a new paragraph.  This is for text of this form:</p>
<p>
   foo>    This line with extra indentation starts
   foo> a paragraph that continues on more lines.</p>
<p>
These lines are filled together.</p>
<p>
When calling from a program, pass the range to fill
as the first two arguments.</p>
<p>
Optional third and fourth arguments JUSTIFY and CITATION-REGEXP:
JUSTIFY to justify paragraphs (prefix arg).
When filling a mail message, pass a regexp for CITATION-REGEXP
which will match the prefix of a line which is a citation marker
plus whitespace, but no other kind of prefix.
Also, if CITATION-REGEXP is non-nil, don't fill header lines.</p>
