<h3>Variable: jit-lock-after-change-extend-region-functions</h3>
<p>
Hook that can extend the text to refontify after a change.<br>
This is run after every buffer change.  The functions are called with<br>
the three arguments of `after-change-functions': START END OLD-LEN.<br>
The extended region to refontify is returned indirectly by modifying<br>
the variables `jit-lock-start' and `jit-lock-end'.<br>
<br>
Note that extending the region this way is not strictly necessary, except<br>
that the nature of the redisplay code tends to otherwise leave some of<br>
the rehighlighted text displayed with the old highlight until the next<br>
redisplay (see comment about repeated redisplay in `jit-lock-fontify-now').</p>
