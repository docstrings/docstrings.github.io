<h3>Variable: mail-dont-reply-to-names</h3>
<p>
Regexp specifying addresses to prune from a reply message.
If this is nil, it is set the first time you compose a reply, to
a value which excludes your own email address.</p>
<p>
Matching addresses are excluded from the CC field in replies, and
also the To field, unless this would leave an empty To field.</p>
