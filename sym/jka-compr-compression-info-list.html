<h3>Variable: jka-compr-compression-info-list</h3>
<p>
List of vectors that describe available compression techniques.<br>
Each element, which describes a compression technique, is a vector of<br>
the form [REGEXP COMPRESS-MSG COMPRESS-PROGRAM COMPRESS-ARGS<br>
UNCOMPRESS-MSG UNCOMPRESS-PROGRAM UNCOMPRESS-ARGS<br>
APPEND-FLAG STRIP-EXTENSION-FLAG FILE-MAGIC-CHARS], where:<br>
<br>
   regexp                is a regexp that matches filenames that are<br>
                         compressed with this format<br>
<br>
   compress-msg          is the message to issue to the user when doing this<br>
                         type of compression (nil means no message)<br>
<br>
   compress-program      is a program that performs this compression<br>
                         (nil means visit file in read-only mode)<br>
<br>
   compress-args         is a list of args to pass to the compress program<br>
<br>
   uncompress-msg        is the message to issue to the user when doing this<br>
                         type of uncompression (nil means no message)<br>
<br>
   uncompress-program    is a program that performs this compression<br>
<br>
   uncompress-args       is a list of args to pass to the uncompress program<br>
<br>
   append-flag           is non-nil if this compression technique can be<br>
                         appended<br>
<br>
   strip-extension-flag  non-nil means strip the regexp from file names<br>
                         before attempting to set the mode.<br>
<br>
   file-magic-chars      is a string of characters that you would find<br>
			 at the beginning of a file compressed in this way.<br>
<br>
If you set this outside Custom while Auto Compression mode is<br>
already enabled (as it is by default), you have to call
`jka-compr-update' after setting it to properly update other
variables.  Setting this through Custom does that automatically.</p>
