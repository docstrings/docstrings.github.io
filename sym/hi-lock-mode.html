<h3>Function: hi-lock-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle selective highlighting of patterns (Hi Lock mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Hi Lock mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
Hi Lock mode is automatically enabled when you invoke any of the
highlighting commands listed below, such as M-s h r.
To enable Hi Lock mode in all buffers, use `global-hi-lock-mode'
or add (global-hi-lock-mode 1) to your init file.</p>
<p>
In buffers where Font Lock mode is enabled, patterns are
highlighted using font lock.  In buffers where Font Lock mode is
disabled, patterns are applied using overlays; in this case, the
highlighting will not be updated as you type.</p>
<p>
When Hi Lock mode is enabled, a "Regexp Highlighting" submenu
is added to the "Edit" menu.  The commands in the submenu,
which can be called interactively, are:</p>
<p>
M-s h r REGEXP FACE
  Highlight matches of pattern REGEXP in current buffer with FACE.</p>
<p>
M-s h p PHRASE FACE
  Highlight matches of phrase PHRASE in current buffer with FACE.
  (PHRASE can be any REGEXP, but spaces will be replaced by matches
  to whitespace and initial lower-case letters will become case insensitive.)</p>
<p>
M-s h l REGEXP FACE
  Highlight lines containing matches of REGEXP in current buffer with FACE.</p>
<p>
M-s h u REGEXP
  Remove highlighting on matches of REGEXP in current buffer.</p>
<p>
M-s h w
  Write active REGEXPs into buffer as comments (if possible).  They may
  be read the next time file is loaded or when the M-s h f command
  is issued.  The inserted regexps are in the form of font lock keywords.
  (See `font-lock-keywords'.)  They may be edited and re-loaded with M-s h f,
  any valid `font-lock-keywords' form is acceptable.  When a file is
  loaded the patterns are read if `hi-lock-file-patterns-policy' is
  'ask and the user responds y to the prompt, or if
  `hi-lock-file-patterns-policy' is bound to a function and that
  function returns t.</p>
<p>
M-s h f
  Re-read patterns stored in buffer (in the format produced by M-s h w).</p>
<p>
When hi-lock is started and if the mode is not excluded or patterns
rejected, the beginning of the buffer is searched for lines of the
form:
  Hi-lock: FOO</p>
<p>
where FOO is a list of patterns.  The patterns must start before
position (number of characters into buffer)
`hi-lock-file-patterns-range'.  Patterns will be read until
Hi-lock: end is found.  A mode is excluded if it's in the list
`hi-lock-exclude-modes'.</p>
