<h3>Function: buffer-face-set</h3>
<p>
Enable `buffer-face-mode', using face specs SPECS.
Each argument in SPECS should be a face, i.e. either a face name
or a property list of face attributes and values.  If more than
one face is listed, that specifies an aggregate face, like in a
`face' text property.  If SPECS is nil or omitted, disable
`buffer-face-mode'.</p>
<p>
This function makes the variable `buffer-face-mode-face' buffer
local, and sets it to FACE.</p>
