<h3>Variable: imenu-generic-expression</h3>
<p>
List of definition matchers for creating an Imenu index.
Each element of this list should have the form</p>
<p>
  (MENU-TITLE REGEXP INDEX [FUNCTION] [ARGUMENTS...])</p>
<p>
MENU-TITLE should be nil (in which case the matches for this
element are put in the top level of the buffer index) or a
string (which specifies the title of a submenu into which the
matches are put).
REGEXP is a regular expression matching a definition construct
which is to be displayed in the menu.  REGEXP may also be a
function, called without arguments.  It is expected to search
backwards.  It must return true and set `match-data' if it finds
another element.
INDEX is an integer specifying which subexpression of REGEXP
matches the definition's name; this subexpression is displayed as
the menu item.
FUNCTION, if present, specifies a function to call when the index
item is selected by the user.  This function is called with
arguments consisting of the item name, the buffer position, and
the ARGUMENTS.</p>
<p>
The variable `imenu-case-fold-search' determines whether or not
the regexp matches are case sensitive, and `imenu-syntax-alist'
can be used to alter the syntax table for the search.</p>
<p>
If non-nil this pattern is passed to `imenu--generic-function' to
create a buffer index.</p>
<p>
For example, see the value of `fortran-imenu-generic-expression'
used by `fortran-mode' with `imenu-syntax-alist' set locally to
give the characters which normally have "symbol" syntax
"word" syntax during matching.</p>
