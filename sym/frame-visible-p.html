<h3>Function: frame-visible-p</h3>
<p>
Return t if FRAME is "visible" (actually in use for display).<br>
Return the symbol `icon' if FRAME is iconified or "minimized".<br>
Return nil if FRAME was made invisible, via `make-frame-invisible'.<br>
On graphical displays, invisible frames are not updated and are<br>
usually not displayed at all, even in a window system's "taskbar".<br>
<br>
If FRAME is a text terminal frame, this always returns t.<br>
Such frames are always considered visible, whether or not they are<br>
currently being displayed on the terminal.
