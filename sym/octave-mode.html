<h3>Function: octave-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for editing Octave code.</p>
<p>
This mode makes it easier to write Octave code by helping with
indentation, doing some of the typing for you (with Abbrev mode) and by
showing keywords, comments, strings, etc. in different faces (with
Font Lock mode on terminals that support it).</p>
<p>
Octave itself is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for
solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.  Function definitions
can also be stored in files, and it can be used in a batch mode (which
is why you need this mode!).</p>
<p>
The latest released version of Octave is always available via anonymous
ftp from ftp.octave.org in the directory `/pub/octave'.  Complete
source and binaries for several popular systems are available.</p>
<p>
Type M-x list-abbrevs to display the built-in abbrevs for Octave keywords.</p>
<p>
Keybindings
===========</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `octave-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

Variables you can use to customize Octave mode
==============================================</p>
<p>
`octave-blink-matching-block'
  Non-nil means show matching begin of block when inserting a space,
  newline or semicolon after an else or end keyword.  Default is t.</p>
<p>
`octave-block-offset'
  Extra indentation applied to statements in block structures.
  Default is 2.</p>
<p>
`octave-continuation-offset'
  Extra indentation applied to Octave continuation lines.
  Default is 4.</p>
<p>
`octave-continuation-string'
  String used for Octave continuation lines.
  Default is a backslash.</p>
<p>
`octave-send-echo-input'
  Non-nil means always display `inferior-octave-buffer' after sending a
  command to the inferior Octave process.</p>
<p>
`octave-send-line-auto-forward'
  Non-nil means always go to the next unsent line of Octave code after
  sending a line to the inferior Octave process.</p>
<p>
`octave-send-echo-input'
  Non-nil means echo input sent to the inferior Octave process.</p>
<p>
Turning on Octave mode runs the hook `octave-mode-hook'.</p>
<p>
To begin using this mode for all `.m' files that you edit, add the
following lines to your init file:</p>
<p>
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.m\\'" . octave-mode))</p>
<p>
To automatically turn on the abbrev and auto-fill features,
add the following lines to your init file as well:</p>
<p>
  (add-hook 'octave-mode-hook
	    (lambda ()
	      (abbrev-mode 1)
	      (auto-fill-mode 1)))</p>
<p>
To submit a problem report, enter M-x octave-submit-bug-report from an Octave mode buffer.
This automatically sets up a mail buffer with version information
already added.  You just need to add a description of the problem,
including a reproducible test case and send the message.</p>
