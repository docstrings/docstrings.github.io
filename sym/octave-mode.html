<h3>Function: octave-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for editing Octave code.<br>
<br>
This mode makes it easier to write Octave code by helping with<br>
indentation, doing some of the typing for you (with Abbrev mode) and by<br>
showing keywords, comments, strings, etc. in different faces (with<br>
Font Lock mode on terminals that support it).<br>
<br>
Octave itself is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical<br>
computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for<br>
solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.  Function definitions<br>
can also be stored in files, and it can be used in a batch mode (which<br>
is why you need this mode!).<br>
<br>
The latest released version of Octave is always available via anonymous<br>
ftp from ftp.octave.org in the directory `/pub/octave'.  Complete<br>
source and binaries for several popular systems are available.<br>
<br>
Type M-x list-abbrevs to display the built-in abbrevs for Octave keywords.<br>
<br>
Keybindings<br>
===========<br>
<br>
<br>
Uses keymap `octave-mode-map', which is not currently defined.<br>
<br>
<br>
Variables you can use to customize Octave mode<br>
==============================================<br>
<br>
`octave-blink-matching-block'<br>
  Non-nil means show matching begin of block when inserting a space,<br>
  newline or semicolon after an else or end keyword.  Default is t.<br>
<br>
`octave-block-offset'<br>
  Extra indentation applied to statements in block structures.<br>
  Default is 2.<br>
<br>
`octave-continuation-offset'<br>
  Extra indentation applied to Octave continuation lines.<br>
  Default is 4.<br>
<br>
`octave-continuation-string'<br>
  String used for Octave continuation lines.<br>
  Default is a backslash.<br>
<br>
`octave-send-echo-input'<br>
  Non-nil means always display `inferior-octave-buffer' after sending a<br>
  command to the inferior Octave process.<br>
<br>
`octave-send-line-auto-forward'<br>
  Non-nil means always go to the next unsent line of Octave code after<br>
  sending a line to the inferior Octave process.<br>
<br>
`octave-send-echo-input'<br>
  Non-nil means echo input sent to the inferior Octave process.<br>
<br>
Turning on Octave mode runs the hook `octave-mode-hook'.<br>
<br>
To begin using this mode for all `.m' files that you edit, add the<br>
following lines to your init file:<br>
<br>
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.m\\'" . octave-mode))<br>
<br>
To automatically turn on the abbrev and auto-fill features,<br>
add the following lines to your init file as well:<br>
<br>
  (add-hook 'octave-mode-hook<br>
	    (lambda ()<br>
	      (abbrev-mode 1)<br>
	      (auto-fill-mode 1)))<br>
<br>
To submit a problem report, enter M-x octave-submit-bug-report from an Octave mode buffer.
This automatically sets up a mail buffer with version information
already added.  You just need to add a description of the problem,
including a reproducible test case and send the message.
