<h3>Variable: package--builtins</h3>
<p>
Alist of built-in packages.<br>
The actual value is initialized by loading the library<br>
`finder-inf'; this is not done until it is needed, e.g. by the<br>
function `package-built-in-p'.<br>
<br>
Each element has the form (PKG . DESC), where PKG is a package<br>
name (a symbol) and DESC is a vector that describes the package.<br>
The vector DESC has the form [VERSION-LIST REQS DOCSTRING].<br>
  VERSION-LIST is a version list.<br>
  REQS is a list of packages required by the package, each<br>
   requirement having the form (NAME VL), where NAME is a string<br>
   and VL is a version list.<br>
  DOCSTRING is a brief description of the package.</p>
