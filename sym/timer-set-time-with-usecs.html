<h3>Function: timer-set-time-with-usecs</h3>
<p>
Set the trigger time of TIMER to TIME plus USECS.
TIME must be in the internal format returned by, e.g., `current-time'.
The microsecond count from TIME is ignored, and USECS is used instead.
If optional fourth argument DELTA is a positive number, make the timer
fire repeatedly that many seconds apart.</p>
