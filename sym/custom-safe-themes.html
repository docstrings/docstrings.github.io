<h3>Variable: custom-safe-themes</h3>
<p>
Themes that are considered safe to load.<br>
If the value is a list, each element should be either the SHA-256<br>
hash of a safe theme file, or the symbol `default', which stands<br>
for any theme in the built-in Emacs theme directory (a directory<br>
named "themes" in `data-directory').<br>
<br>
If the value is t, Emacs treats all themes as safe.<br>
<br>
This variable cannot be set in a Custom theme.</p>
