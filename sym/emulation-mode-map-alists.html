<h3>Variable: emulation-mode-map-alists</h3>
<p>
List of keymap alists to use for emulations modes.<br>
It is intended for modes or packages using multiple minor-mode keymaps.<br>
Each element is a keymap alist just like `minor-mode-map-alist', or a<br>
symbol with a variable binding which is a keymap alist, and it is used<br>
the same way.  The "active" keymaps in each alist are used before<br>
`minor-mode-map-alist' and `minor-mode-overriding-map-alist'.</p>
