<h3>Variable: mouse-autoselect-window</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means autoselect window with mouse pointer.<br>
If nil, do not autoselect windows.<br>
A positive number means delay autoselection by that many seconds: a<br>
window is autoselected only after the mouse has remained in that<br>
window for the duration of the delay.<br>
A negative number has a similar effect, but causes windows to be<br>
autoselected only after the mouse has stopped moving.  (Because of<br>
the way Emacs compares mouse events, you will occasionally wait twice<br>
that time before the window gets selected.)<br>
Any other value means to autoselect window instantaneously when the<br>
mouse pointer enters it.<br>
<br>
Autoselection selects the minibuffer only if it is active, and never<br>
unselects the minibuffer if it is active.<br>
<br>
When customizing this variable make sure that the actual value of<br>
`focus-follows-mouse' matches the behavior of your window manager.</p>
