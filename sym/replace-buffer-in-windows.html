<h3>Function: replace-buffer-in-windows</h3>
<p>
Replace BUFFER-OR-NAME with some other buffer in all windows showing it.
BUFFER-OR-NAME may be a buffer or the name of an existing buffer
and defaults to the current buffer.</p>
<p>
When a window showing BUFFER-OR-NAME is dedicated, that window is
deleted.  If that window is the only window on its frame, the
frame is deleted too when there are other frames left.  If there
are no other frames left, some other buffer is displayed in that
window.</p>
<p>
This function removes the buffer denoted by BUFFER-OR-NAME from
all window-local buffer lists.</p>
