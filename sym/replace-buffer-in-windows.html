<h3>Function: replace-buffer-in-windows</h3>
<p>
Replace BUFFER-OR-NAME with some other buffer in all windows showing it.<br>
BUFFER-OR-NAME may be a buffer or the name of an existing buffer<br>
and defaults to the current buffer.<br>
<br>
When a window showing BUFFER-OR-NAME is dedicated, that window is<br>
deleted.  If that window is the only window on its frame, the<br>
frame is deleted too when there are other frames left.  If there<br>
are no other frames left, some other buffer is displayed in that<br>
window.<br>
<br>
This function removes the buffer denoted by BUFFER-OR-NAME from
all window-local buffer lists.</p>
