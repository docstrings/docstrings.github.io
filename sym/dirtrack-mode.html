<h3>Function: dirtrack-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle directory tracking in shell buffers (Dirtrack mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Dirtrack mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
This method requires that your shell prompt contain the current
working directory at all times, and that you set the variable
`dirtrack-list' to match the prompt.</p>
<p>
This is an alternative to `shell-dirtrack-mode', which works by
tracking `cd' and similar commands which change the shell working
directory.</p>

(fn &optional ARG)</p>
