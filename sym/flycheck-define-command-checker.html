<h3>Function: flycheck-define-command-checker</h3>
<p>
Define SYMBOL as syntax checker to run a command.<br>
<br>
Define SYMBOL as generic syntax checker via<br>
`flycheck-define-generic-checker', which uses an external command<br>
to check the buffer.  SYMBOL and DOCSTRING are the same as for<br>
`flycheck-define-generic-checker'.<br>
<br>
In addition to the properties understood by<br>
`flycheck-define-generic-checker', the following PROPERTIES<br>
constitute a command syntax checker.  Unless otherwise noted, all<br>
properties are mandatory.  Note that the default `:error-filter'<br>
of command checkers is `flycheck-sanitize-errors'.<br>
<br>
`:command COMMAND'<br>
     The command to run for syntax checking.<br>
<br>
     COMMAND is a list of the form `(EXECUTABLE [ARG ...])'.<br>
<br>
     EXECUTABLE is a string with the executable of this syntax<br>
     checker.  It can be overridden with the variable<br>
     `flycheck-SYMBOL-executable'.  Note that this variable is<br>
     NOT implicitly defined by this function.  Use<br>
     `flycheck-def-executable-var' to define this variable.<br>
<br>
     Each ARG is an argument to the executable, either as string,<br>
     or as special symbol or form for<br>
     `flycheck-substitute-argument', which see.<br>
<br>
`:error-patterns PATTERNS'<br>
     A list of patterns to parse the output of the `:command'.<br>
<br>
     Each ITEM in PATTERNS is a list `(LEVEL SEXP ...)', where<br>
     LEVEL is a Flycheck error level (see<br>
     `flycheck-define-error-level'), followed by one or more RX<br>
     `SEXP's which parse an error of that level and extract line,<br>
     column, file name and the message.<br>
<br>
     See `rx' for general information about RX, and<br>
     `flycheck-rx-to-string' for some special RX forms provided<br>
     by Flycheck.<br>
<br>
     All patterns are applied in the order of declaration to the<br>
     whole output of the syntax checker.  Output already matched<br>
     by a pattern will not be matched by subsequent patterns.  In<br>
     other words, the first pattern wins.<br>
<br>
     This property is optional.  If omitted, however, an<br>
     `:error-parser' is mandatory.<br>
<br>
`:error-parser FUNCTION'<br>
     A function to parse errors with.<br>
<br>
     The function shall accept three arguments OUTPUT CHECKER<br>
     BUFFER.  OUTPUT is the syntax checker output as string,<br>
     CHECKER the syntax checker that was used, and BUFFER a<br>
     buffer object representing the checked buffer.  The function<br>
     must return a list of `flycheck-error' objects parsed from<br>
     OUTPUT.<br>
<br>
     This property is optional.  If omitted, it defaults to<br>
     `flycheck-parse-with-patterns'.  In this case,<br>
     `:error-patterns' is mandatory.<br>
<br>
`:standard-input t'<br>
     Whether to send the buffer contents on standard input.<br>
<br>
     If this property is given and has a non-nil value, send the<br>
     contents of the buffer on standard input.<br>
<br>
     Defaults to nil.

Note that you may not give `:start', `:interrupt', and
`:print-doc' for a command checker.  You can give a custom
`:verify' function, though, whose results will be appended to the
default `:verify' function of command checkers.
