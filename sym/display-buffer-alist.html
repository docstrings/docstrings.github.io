<h3>Variable: display-buffer-alist</h3>
<p>
Alist of conditional actions for `display-buffer'.
This is a list of elements (CONDITION . ACTION), where:</p>
<p>
 CONDITION is either a regexp matching buffer names, or a
  function that takes two arguments - a buffer name and the
  ACTION argument of `display-buffer' - and returns a boolean.</p>
<p>
 ACTION is a cons cell (FUNCTION . ALIST), where FUNCTION is a
  function or a list of functions.  Each such function should
  accept two arguments: a buffer to display and an alist of the
  same form as ALIST.  See `display-buffer' for details.</p>
<p>
`display-buffer' scans this alist until it either finds a
matching regular expression or the function specified by a
condition returns non-nil.  In any of these cases, it adds the
associated action to the list of actions it will try.</p>
