<h3>Variable: display-buffer-alist</h3>
<p>
Alist of conditional actions for `display-buffer'.<br>
This is a list of elements (CONDITION . ACTION), where:<br>
<br>
 CONDITION is either a regexp matching buffer names, or a<br>
  function that takes two arguments - a buffer name and the<br>
  ACTION argument of `display-buffer' - and returns a boolean.<br>
<br>
 ACTION is a cons cell (FUNCTION . ALIST), where FUNCTION is a<br>
  function or a list of functions.  Each such function should<br>
  accept two arguments: a buffer to display and an alist of the<br>
  same form as ALIST.  See `display-buffer' for details.<br>
<br>
`display-buffer' scans this alist until it either finds a<br>
matching regular expression or the function specified by a<br>
condition returns non-nil.  In any of these cases, it adds the
associated action to the list of actions it will try.</p>
