<h3>Function: substitute-in-file-name</h3>
<p>
Substitute environment variables referred to in FILENAME.
`$FOO' where FOO is an environment variable name means to substitute
the value of that variable.  The variable name should be terminated
with a character not a letter, digit or underscore; otherwise, enclose
the entire variable name in braces.</p>
<p>
If `/~' appears, all of FILENAME through that `/' is discarded.
If `//' appears, everything up to and including the first of
those `/' is discarded.</p>
