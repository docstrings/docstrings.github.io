<h3>Function: help-at-pt-string</h3>
<p>
Return the help-echo string at point.<br>
Normally, the string produced by the `help-echo' text or overlay<br>
property, or nil, is returned.<br>
If KBD is non-nil, `kbd-help' is used instead, and any<br>
`help-echo' property is ignored.  In this case, the return value<br>
can also be t, if that is the value of the `kbd-help' property.

(fn &optional KBD)</p>
