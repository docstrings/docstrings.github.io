<h3>Function: copy-file</h3>
<p>
Copy FILE to NEWNAME.  Both args must be strings.
If NEWNAME names a directory, copy FILE there.</p>
<p>
This function always sets the file modes of the output file to match
the input file.</p>
<p>
The optional third argument OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS specifies what to do
if file NEWNAME already exists.  If OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS is nil, we
signal a `file-already-exists' error without overwriting.  If
OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS is a number, we request confirmation from the user
about overwriting; this is what happens in interactive use with M-x.
Any other value for OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS means to overwrite the
existing file.</p>
<p>
Fourth arg KEEP-TIME non-nil means give the output file the same
last-modified time as the old one.  (This works on only some systems.)</p>
<p>
A prefix arg makes KEEP-TIME non-nil.</p>
<p>
If PRESERVE-UID-GID is non-nil, we try to transfer the
uid and gid of FILE to NEWNAME.</p>
<p>
If PRESERVE-SELINUX-CONTEXT is non-nil and SELinux is enabled
on the system, we copy the SELinux context of FILE to NEWNAME.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE NEWNAME &optional OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS KEEP-TIME PRESERVE-UID-GID PRESERVE-SELINUX-CONTEXT)</p>
