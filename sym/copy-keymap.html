<h3>Function: copy-keymap</h3>
<p>
Return a copy of the keymap KEYMAP.<br>
The copy starts out with the same definitions of KEYMAP,<br>
but changing either the copy or KEYMAP does not affect the other.<br>
Any key definitions that are subkeymaps are recursively copied.<br>
However, a key definition which is a symbol whose definition is a keymap<br>
is not copied.
