<h3>Function: mail</h3>
<p>
Edit a message to be sent.  Prefix arg means resume editing (don't erase).<br>
When this function returns, the buffer `*mail*' is selected.<br>
The value is t if the message was newly initialized; otherwise, nil.<br>
<br>
Optionally, the signature file `mail-signature-file' can be inserted at the<br>
end; see the variable `mail-signature'.<br>
<br>
<br>
Uses keymap `mail-mode-map', which is not currently defined.<br>
<br>
While editing message, type M-x mail-send-and-exit to send the message and exit.<br>
<br>
Various special commands starting with C-c are available in sendmail mode<br>
to move to message header fields:<br>
<br>
Uses keymap `mail-mode-map', which is not currently defined.<br>
<br>
<br>
If `mail-self-blind' is non-nil, a BCC to yourself is inserted<br>
when the message is initialized.<br>
<br>
If `mail-default-reply-to' is non-nil, it should be an address (a string);<br>
a Reply-to: field with that address is inserted.<br>
<br>
If `mail-archive-file-name' is non-nil, an FCC field with that file name<br>
is inserted.<br>
<br>
The normal hook `mail-setup-hook' is run after the message is<br>
initialized.  It can add more default fields to the message.<br>
<br>
The first argument, NOERASE, determines what to do when there is<br>
an existing modified `*mail*' buffer.  If NOERASE is nil, the<br>
existing mail buffer is used, and the user is prompted whether to<br>
keep the old contents or to erase them.  If NOERASE has the value<br>
`new', a new mail buffer will be created instead of using the old<br>
one.  Any other non-nil value means to always select the old<br>
buffer without erasing the contents.<br>
<br>
The second through fifth arguments,<br>
 TO, SUBJECT, IN-REPLY-TO and CC, specify if non-nil<br>
 the initial contents of those header fields.<br>
 These arguments should not have final newlines.<br>
The sixth argument REPLYBUFFER is a buffer which contains an<br>
 original message being replied to, or else an action<br>
 of the form (FUNCTION . ARGS) which says how to insert the original.<br>
 Or it can be nil, if not replying to anything.<br>
The seventh argument ACTIONS is a list of actions to take<br>
 if/when the message is sent.  Each action looks like (FUNCTION . ARGS);<br>
 when the message is sent, we apply FUNCTION to ARGS.
 This is how Rmail arranges to mark messages `answered'.
