<h3>Function: fill-french-nobreak-p</h3>
<p>
Return nil if French style allows breaking the line at point.
This is used in `fill-nobreak-predicate' to prevent breaking lines just
after an opening paren or just before a closing paren or a punctuation
mark such as `?' or `:'.  It is common in French writing to put a space
at such places, which would normally allow breaking the line at those
places.</p>
