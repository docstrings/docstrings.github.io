<h3>Function: fit-window-to-buffer</h3>
<p>
Adjust height of WINDOW to display its buffer's contents exactly.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</p>
<p>
Optional argument MAX-HEIGHT specifies the maximum height of
WINDOW and defaults to the height of WINDOW's frame.  Optional
argument MIN-HEIGHT specifies the minimum height of WINDOW and
defaults to `window-min-height'.  Both MAX-HEIGHT and MIN-HEIGHT
are specified in lines and include the mode line and header line,
if any.</p>
<p>
If WINDOW is a full height window, then if the option
`fit-frame-to-buffer' is non-nil, this calls the function
`fit-frame-to-buffer' to adjust the frame height.</p>
<p>
Return the number of lines by which WINDOW was enlarged or
shrunk.  If an error occurs during resizing, return nil but don't
signal an error.</p>
<p>
Note that even if this function makes WINDOW large enough to show
_all_ lines of its buffer you might not see the first lines when
WINDOW was scrolled.</p>
