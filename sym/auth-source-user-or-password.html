<h3>Function: auth-source-user-or-password</h3>
<p>
Find MODE (string or list of strings) matching HOST and PORT.<br>
<br>
DEPRECATED in favor of `auth-source-search'!<br>
<br>
USERNAME is optional and will be used as "login" in a search<br>
across the Secret Service API (see secrets.el) if the resulting<br>
items don't have a username.  This means that if you search for<br>
username "joe" and it matches an item but the item doesn't have<br>
a :user attribute, the username "joe" will be returned.<br>
<br>
A non nil DELETE-EXISTING means deleting any matching password<br>
entry in the respective sources.  This is useful only when<br>
CREATE-MISSING is non nil as well; the intended use case is to<br>
remove wrong password entries.<br>
<br>
If no matching entry is found, and CREATE-MISSING is non nil,<br>
the password will be retrieved interactively, and it will be<br>
stored in the password database which matches best (see
`auth-sources').

MODE can be "login" or "password".</p>
