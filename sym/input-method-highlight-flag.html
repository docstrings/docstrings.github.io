<h3>Variable: input-method-highlight-flag</h3>
<p>
If this flag is non-nil, input methods highlight partially-entered text.
For instance, while you are in the middle of a Quail input method sequence,
the text inserted so far is temporarily underlined.
The underlining goes away when you finish or abort the input method sequence.
See also the variable `input-method-verbose-flag'.</p>
