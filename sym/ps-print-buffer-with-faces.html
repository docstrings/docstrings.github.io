<h3>Function: ps-print-buffer-with-faces</h3>
<p>
Generate and print a PostScript image of the buffer.
Like `ps-print-buffer', but includes font, color, and underline information in
the generated image.  This command works only if you are using a window system,
so it has a way to determine color values.</p>
