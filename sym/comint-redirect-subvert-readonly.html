<h3>Variable: comint-redirect-subvert-readonly</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means `comint-redirect' can insert into read-only buffers.<br>
This works by binding `inhibit-read-only' around the insertion.<br>
This is useful, for instance, for insertion into Help mode buffers.<br>
You probably want to set it locally to the output buffer.</p>
