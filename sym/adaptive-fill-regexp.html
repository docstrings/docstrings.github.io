<h3>Variable: adaptive-fill-regexp</h3>
<p>
Regexp to match text at start of line that constitutes indentation.
If Adaptive Fill mode is enabled, a prefix matching this pattern
on the first and second lines of a paragraph is used as the
standard indentation for the whole paragraph.</p>
<p>
If the paragraph has just one line, the indentation is taken from that
line, but in that case `adaptive-fill-first-line-regexp' also plays
a role.</p>
