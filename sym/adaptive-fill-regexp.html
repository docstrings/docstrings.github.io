<h3>Variable: adaptive-fill-regexp</h3>
<p>
Regexp to match text at start of line that constitutes indentation.<br>
If Adaptive Fill mode is enabled, a prefix matching this pattern<br>
on the first and second lines of a paragraph is used as the<br>
standard indentation for the whole paragraph.<br>
<br>
If the paragraph has just one line, the indentation is taken from that<br>
line, but in that case `adaptive-fill-first-line-regexp' also plays
a role.</p>
