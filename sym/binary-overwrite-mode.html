<h3>Function: binary-overwrite-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle Binary Overwrite mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Binary Overwrite mode if ARG
is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,
enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When Binary Overwrite mode is enabled, printing characters typed
in replace existing text.  Newlines are not treated specially, so
typing at the end of a line joins the line to the next, with the
typed character between them.  Typing before a tab character
simply replaces the tab with the character typed.
C-q replaces the text at the cursor, just as
ordinary typing characters do.</p>
<p>
Note that Binary Overwrite mode is not its own minor mode; it is
a specialization of overwrite mode, entered by setting the
`overwrite-mode' variable to `overwrite-mode-binary'.</p>
