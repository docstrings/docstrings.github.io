<h3>Variable: x-pixel-size-width-font-regexp</h3>
<p>
Regexp matching a font name whose width is the same as `PIXEL_SIZE'.</p>
<p>
Since Emacs gets width of a font matching with this regexp from
PIXEL_SIZE field of the name, font finding mechanism gets faster for
such a font.  This is especially effective for such large fonts as
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.</p>
