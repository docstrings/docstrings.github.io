<h3>Function: replace-match-maybe-edit</h3>
<p>
Make a replacement with `replace-match', editing `\?'.<br>
NEWTEXT, FIXEDCASE, LITERAL are just passed on.  If NOEDIT is true, no<br>
check for `\?' is made to save time.  MATCH-DATA is used for the<br>
replacement.  In case editing is done, it is changed to use markers.<br>
<br>
The return value is non-nil if there has been no `\?' or NOEDIT was<br>
passed in.  If LITERAL is set, no checking is done, anyway.</p>
