<h3>Variable: special-display-regexps</h3>
<p>
List of regexps saying which buffers should be displayed specially.
Displaying a buffer with `display-buffer' or `pop-to-buffer', if
any regexp in this list matches its name, displays it specially
using `special-display-function'.  `special-display-popup-frame'
(the default for `special-display-function') usually displays
the buffer in a separate frame made with the parameters specified
by `special-display-frame-alist'.  If `special-display-function'
has been set to some other function, that function is called with
the buffer as first, and nil as second argument.</p>
<p>
Alternatively, an element of this list can be specified as
(REGEXP FRAME-PARAMETERS), where REGEXP is a regexp as above and
FRAME-PARAMETERS an alist of (PARAMETER . VALUE) pairs.
`special-display-popup-frame' will then interpret these pairs as
frame parameters when creating a special frame for a buffer whose
name matches REGEXP, overriding the corresponding values from
`special-display-frame-alist'.</p>
<p>
As a special case, if FRAME-PARAMETERS contains (same-window . t)
`special-display-popup-frame' displays buffers matching REGEXP in
the selected window.  (same-frame . t) in FRAME-PARAMETERS means
to display such buffers in a window on the selected frame.</p>
<p>
If `special-display-function' specifies some other function than
`special-display-popup-frame', that function is called with the
buffer whose name matched REGEXP as first, and FRAME-PARAMETERS
as second argument.</p>
<p>
Finally, an element of this list can be also specified as
(REGEXP FUNCTION OTHER-ARGS).  `special-display-popup-frame'
will then call FUNCTION with the buffer whose name matched
REGEXP as first, and OTHER-ARGS as second argument.</p>
<p>
Any alternative function specified here is responsible for
setting up the quit-restore parameter of the window used.</p>
<p>
If this variable appears "not to work", because you added a
name to it but the corresponding buffer is displayed in the
selected window, look at the values of `same-window-buffer-names'
and `same-window-regexps'.  Those variables take precedence over
this one.</p>
