<h3>Function: x-set-selection</h3>
<p>
Make an X selection of type TYPE and value DATA.
The argument TYPE (nil means `PRIMARY') says which selection, and
DATA specifies the contents.  TYPE must be a symbol.  (It can also
be a string, which stands for the symbol with that name, but this
is considered obsolete.)  DATA may be a string, a symbol, an
integer (or a cons of two integers or list of two integers).</p>
<p>
The selection may also be a cons of two markers pointing to the same buffer,
or an overlay.  In these cases, the selection is considered to be the text
between the markers *at whatever time the selection is examined*.
Thus, editing done in the buffer after you specify the selection
can alter the effective value of the selection.</p>
<p>
The data may also be a vector of valid non-vector selection values.</p>
<p>
The return value is DATA.</p>
<p>
Interactively, this command sets the primary selection.  Without
prefix argument, it reads the selection in the minibuffer.  With
prefix argument, it uses the text of the region as the selection value.</p>
<p>
Note that on MS-Windows, primary and secondary selections set by Emacs
are not available to other programs.</p>
