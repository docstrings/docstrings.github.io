<h3>Function: customize-push-and-save</h3>
<p>
Add ELTS to LIST-VAR and save for future sessions, safely.
ELTS should be a list.  This function adds each entry to the
value of LIST-VAR using `add-to-list'.</p>
<p>
If Emacs is initialized, call `customize-save-variable' to save
the resulting list value now.  Otherwise, add an entry to
`after-init-hook' to save it after initialization.</p>
<p>
(fn LIST-VAR ELTS)</p>
