<h3>Variable: vc-handled-backends</h3>
<p>
List of version control backends for which VC will be used.
Entries in this list will be tried in order to determine whether a
file is under that sort of version control.
Removing an entry from the list prevents VC from being activated
when visiting a file managed by that backend.
An empty list disables VC altogether.</p>
