<h3>Variable: tags-table-list</h3>
<p>
List of file names of tags tables to search.<br>
An element that is a directory means the file "TAGS" in that directory.<br>
To switch to a new list of tags tables, setting this variable is sufficient.<br>
If you set this variable, do not also set `tags-file-name'.<br>
Use the `etags' program to make a tags table file.</p>
