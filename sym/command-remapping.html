<h3>Function: command-remapping</h3>
<p>
Return the remapping for command COMMAND.
Returns nil if COMMAND is not remapped (or not a symbol).</p>
<p>
If the optional argument POSITION is non-nil, it specifies a mouse
position as returned by `event-start' and `event-end', and the
remapping occurs in the keymaps associated with it.  It can also be a
number or marker, in which case the keymap properties at the specified
buffer position instead of point are used.  The KEYMAPS argument is
ignored if POSITION is non-nil.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument KEYMAPS is non-nil, it should be a list of
keymaps to search for command remapping.  Otherwise, search for the
remapping in all currently active keymaps.</p>
