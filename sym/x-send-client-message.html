<h3>Function: x-send-client-message</h3>
<p>
Send a client message of MESSAGE-TYPE to window DEST on DISPLAY.</p>
<p>
For DISPLAY, specify either a frame or a display name (a string).
If DISPLAY is nil, that stands for the selected frame's display.
DEST may be a number, in which case it is a Window id.  The value 0 may
be used to send to the root window of the DISPLAY.
If DEST is a cons, it is converted to a 32 bit number
with the high 16 bits from the car and the lower 16 bit from the cdr.  That
number is then used as a window id.
If DEST is a frame the event is sent to the outer window of that frame.
A value of nil means the currently selected frame.
If DEST is the string "PointerWindow" the event is sent to the window that
contains the pointer.  If DEST is the string "InputFocus" the event is
sent to the window that has the input focus.
FROM is the frame sending the event.  Use nil for currently selected frame.
MESSAGE-TYPE is the name of an Atom as a string.
FORMAT must be one of 8, 16 or 32 and determines the size of the values in
bits.  VALUES is a list of numbers, cons and/or strings containing the values
to send.  If a value is a string, it is converted to an Atom and the value of
the Atom is sent.  If a value is a cons, it is converted to a 32 bit number
with the high 16 bits from the car and the lower 16 bit from the cdr.
If more values than fits into the event is given, the excessive values
are ignored.</p>
