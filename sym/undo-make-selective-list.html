<h3>Function: undo-make-selective-list</h3>
<p>
Return a list of undo elements for the region START to END.<br>
The elements come from `buffer-undo-list', but we keep only<br>
the elements inside this region, and discard those outside this region.<br>
If we find an element that crosses an edge of this region,<br>
we stop and ignore all further elements.</p>
