<h3>Variable: gc-cons-threshold</h3>
<p>
Number of bytes of consing between garbage collections.<br>
Garbage collection can happen automatically once this many bytes have been<br>
allocated since the last garbage collection.  All data types count.<br>
<br>
Garbage collection happens automatically only when `eval' is called.<br>
<br>
By binding this temporarily to a large number, you can effectively<br>
prevent garbage collection during a part of the program.<br>
See also `gc-cons-percentage'.</p>
