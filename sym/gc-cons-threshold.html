<h3>Variable: gc-cons-threshold</h3>
<p>
Number of bytes of consing between garbage collections.
Garbage collection can happen automatically once this many bytes have been
allocated since the last garbage collection.  All data types count.</p>
<p>
Garbage collection happens automatically only when `eval' is called.</p>
<p>
By binding this temporarily to a large number, you can effectively
prevent garbage collection during a part of the program.
See also `gc-cons-percentage'.</p>
