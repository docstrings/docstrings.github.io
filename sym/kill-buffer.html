<h3>Function: kill-buffer</h3>
<p>
Kill the buffer specified by BUFFER-OR-NAME.
The argument may be a buffer or the name of an existing buffer.
Argument nil or omitted means kill the current buffer.  Return t if the
buffer is actually killed, nil otherwise.</p>
<p>
The functions in `kill-buffer-query-functions' are called with the
buffer to be killed as the current buffer.  If any of them returns nil,
the buffer is not killed.  The hook `kill-buffer-hook' is run before the
buffer is actually killed.  The buffer being killed will be current
while the hook is running.  Functions called by any of these hooks are
supposed to not change the current buffer.</p>
<p>
Any processes that have this buffer as the `process-buffer' are killed
with SIGHUP.  This function calls `replace-buffer-in-windows' for
cleaning up all windows currently displaying the buffer to be killed.</p>
