<h3>Function: table-generate-source</h3>
<p>
Generate source of the current table in the specified language.
LANGUAGE is a symbol that specifies the language to describe the
structure of the table.  It must be either 'html, 'latex or 'cals.
The resulted source text is inserted into DEST-BUFFER and the buffer
object is returned.  When DEST-BUFFER is omitted or nil the default
buffer specified in `table-dest-buffer-name' is used.  In this case
the content of the default buffer is erased prior to the generation.
When DEST-BUFFER is non-nil it is expected to be either a destination
buffer or a name of the destination buffer.  In this case the
generated result is inserted at the current point in the destination
buffer and the previously existing contents in the buffer are
untouched.</p>
