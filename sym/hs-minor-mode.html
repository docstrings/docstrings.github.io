<h3>Function: hs-minor-mode</h3>
<p>
Minor mode to selectively hide/show code and comment blocks.<br>
With a prefix argument ARG, enable the mode if ARG is positive,<br>
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode<br>
if ARG is omitted or nil.<br>
<br>
When hideshow minor mode is on, the menu bar is augmented with hideshow<br>
commands and the hideshow commands are enabled.<br>
The value '(hs . t) is added to `buffer-invisibility-spec'.<br>
<br>
The main commands are: `hs-hide-all', `hs-show-all', `hs-hide-block',<br>
`hs-show-block', `hs-hide-level' and `hs-toggle-hiding'.  There is also<br>
`hs-hide-initial-comment-block' and `hs-mouse-toggle-hiding'.<br>
<br>
Turning hideshow minor mode off reverts the menu bar and the<br>
variables to default values and disables the hideshow commands.<br>
<br>
Lastly, the normal hook `hs-minor-mode-hook' is run using `run-hooks'.<br>
<br>
Key bindings:<br>

Uses keymap `hs-minor-mode-map', which is not currently defined.
