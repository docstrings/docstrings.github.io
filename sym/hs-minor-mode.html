<h3>Function: hs-minor-mode</h3>
<p>
Minor mode to selectively hide/show code and comment blocks.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable the mode if ARG is positive,
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode
if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When hideshow minor mode is on, the menu bar is augmented with hideshow
commands and the hideshow commands are enabled.
The value '(hs . t) is added to `buffer-invisibility-spec'.</p>
<p>
The main commands are: `hs-hide-all', `hs-show-all', `hs-hide-block',
`hs-show-block', `hs-hide-level' and `hs-toggle-hiding'.  There is also
`hs-hide-initial-comment-block' and `hs-mouse-toggle-hiding'.</p>
<p>
Turning hideshow minor mode off reverts the menu bar and the
variables to default values and disables the hideshow commands.</p>
<p>
Lastly, the normal hook `hs-minor-mode-hook' is run using `run-hooks'.</p>
<p>
Key bindings:</p>
