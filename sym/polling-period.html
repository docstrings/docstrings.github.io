<h3>Variable: polling-period</h3>
<p>
Interval between polling for input during Lisp execution.<br>
The reason for polling is to make C-g work to stop a running program.<br>
Polling is needed only when using X windows and SIGIO does not work.<br>
Polling is automatically disabled in all other cases.</p>
