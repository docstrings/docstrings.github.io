<h3>Function: set-goal-column</h3>
<p>
Set the current horizontal position as a goal for C-n and C-p.<br>
Those commands will move to this position in the line moved to<br>
rather than trying to keep the same horizontal position.<br>
With a non-nil argument ARG, clears out the goal column<br>
so that C-n and C-p resume vertical motion.<br>
The goal column is stored in the variable `goal-column'.</p>
