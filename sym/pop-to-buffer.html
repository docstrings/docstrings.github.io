<h3>Function: pop-to-buffer</h3>
<p>
Select buffer BUFFER in some window, preferably a different one.
BUFFER may be a buffer, a string (a buffer name), or nil.  If it
is a string not naming an existent buffer, create a buffer with
that name.  If BUFFER is nil, choose some other buffer.  Return
the buffer.</p>
<p>
This uses `display-buffer' as a subroutine.  The optional ACTION
argument is passed to `display-buffer' as its ACTION argument.
See `display-buffer' for more information.  ACTION is t if called
interactively with a prefix argument, which means to pop to a
window other than the selected one even if the buffer is already
displayed in the selected window.</p>
<p>
If the window to show BUFFER is not on the selected
frame, raise that window's frame and give it input focus.</p>
<p>
Optional third arg NORECORD non-nil means do not put this buffer
at the front of the list of recently selected ones.</p>
