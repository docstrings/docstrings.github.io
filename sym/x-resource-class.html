<h3>Variable: x-resource-class</h3>
<p>
The class Emacs uses to look up X resources.
`x-get-resource' uses this as the first component of the instance class
when requesting resource values.</p>
<p>
Emacs initially sets `x-resource-class' to "Emacs".</p>
<p>
Setting this variable permanently is not a reasonable thing to do,
but binding this variable locally around a call to `x-get-resource'
is a reasonable practice.  See also the variable `x-resource-name'.</p>
