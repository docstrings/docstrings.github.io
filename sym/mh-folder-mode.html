<h3>Function: mh-folder-mode</h3>
<p>
Major MH-E mode for "editing" an MH folder scan listing.<br>
Uses keymap `mh-folder-mode-map', which is not currently defined.<br>
<br>
<br>
You can show the message the cursor is pointing to, and step through<br>
the messages. Messages can be marked for deletion or refiling into<br>
another folder; these commands are executed all at once with a<br>
separate command.<br>
<br>
Options that control this mode can be changed with<br>
M-x customize-group; specify the "mh" group. In particular, please<br>
see the `mh-scan-format-file' option if you wish to modify scan's<br>
format.<br>
<br>
When a folder is visited, the hook `mh-folder-mode-hook' is run.<br>
<br>
Ranges<br>
======<br>
Many commands that operate on individual messages, such as<br>
`mh-forward' or `mh-refile-msg' take a RANGE argument. This argument<br>
can be used in several ways.<br>
<br>
If you provide the prefix argument (C-u) to<br>
these commands, then you will be prompted for the message range.<br>
This can be any valid MH range which can include messages,<br>
sequences, and the abbreviations (described in the mh(1) man<br>
page):<br>
<br>
<num1>-<num2><br>
    Indicates all messages in the range <num1> to <num2>, inclusive.<br>
    The range must be nonempty.<br>
<br>
<num>:N<br>
<num>:+N<br>
<num>:-N<br>
    Up to N messages beginning with (or ending with) message num. Num<br>
    may be any of the predefined symbols: first, prev, cur, next or<br>
    last.<br>
<br>
first:N<br>
prev:N<br>
next:N<br>
last:N<br>
    The first, previous, next or last messages, if they exist.<br>
<br>
all<br>
    All of the messages.<br>
<br>
For example, a range that shows all of these things is `1 2 3<br>
5-10 last:5 unseen'.<br>
<br>
If the option `transient-mark-mode' is set to t and you set a
region in the MH-Folder buffer, then the MH-E command will
perform the operation on all messages in that region.


Uses keymap `mh-folder-mode-map', which is not currently defined.
