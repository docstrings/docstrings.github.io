<h3>Function: mh-folder-mode</h3>
<p>
Major MH-E mode for "editing" an MH folder scan listing.
Uses keymap `mh-folder-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

You can show the message the cursor is pointing to, and step through
the messages. Messages can be marked for deletion or refiling into
another folder; these commands are executed all at once with a
separate command.</p>
<p>
Options that control this mode can be changed with
M-x customize-group; specify the "mh" group. In particular, please
see the `mh-scan-format-file' option if you wish to modify scan's
format.</p>
<p>
When a folder is visited, the hook `mh-folder-mode-hook' is run.</p>
<p>
Ranges
======
Many commands that operate on individual messages, such as
`mh-forward' or `mh-refile-msg' take a RANGE argument. This argument
can be used in several ways.</p>
<p>
If you provide the prefix argument (C-u) to
these commands, then you will be prompted for the message range.
This can be any valid MH range which can include messages,
sequences, and the abbreviations (described in the mh(1) man
page):</p>
<p>
<num1>-<num2>
    Indicates all messages in the range <num1> to <num2>, inclusive.
    The range must be nonempty.</p>
<p>
<num>:N
<num>:+N
<num>:-N
    Up to N messages beginning with (or ending with) message num. Num
    may be any of the predefined symbols: first, prev, cur, next or
    last.</p>
<p>
first:N
prev:N
next:N
last:N
    The first, previous, next or last messages, if they exist.</p>
<p>
all
    All of the messages.</p>
<p>
For example, a range that shows all of these things is `1 2 3
5-10 last:5 unseen'.</p>
<p>
If the option `transient-mark-mode' is set to t and you set a
region in the MH-Folder buffer, then the MH-E command will
perform the operation on all messages in that region.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `mh-folder-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
