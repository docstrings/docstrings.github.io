<h3>Function: add-text-properties</h3>
<p>
Add properties to the text from START to END.
The third argument PROPERTIES is a property list
specifying the property values to add.  If the optional fourth argument
OBJECT is a buffer (or nil, which means the current buffer),
START and END are buffer positions (integers or markers).
If OBJECT is a string, START and END are 0-based indices into it.
Return t if any property value actually changed, nil otherwise.</p>
