<h3>Function: number-to-register</h3>
<p>
Store a number in a register.
Two args, NUMBER and REGISTER (a character, naming the register).
If NUMBER is nil, a decimal number is read from the buffer starting
at point, and point moves to the end of that number.
Interactively, NUMBER is the prefix arg (none means nil).</p>
