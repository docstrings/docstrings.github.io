<h3>Variable: selection-converter-alist</h3>
<p>
An alist associating X Windows selection-types with functions.<br>
These functions are called to convert the selection, with three args:<br>
the name of the selection (typically `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', or `CLIPBOARD');<br>
a desired type to which the selection should be converted;<br>
and the local selection value (whatever was given to `x-own-selection').<br>
<br>
The function should return the value to send to the X server<br>
(typically a string).  A return value of nil<br>
means that the conversion could not be done.<br>
A return value which is the symbol `NULL'<br>
means that a side-effect was executed,<br>
and there is no meaningful selection value.</p>
