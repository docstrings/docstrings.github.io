<h3>Function: filter-buffer-substring</h3>
<p>
Return the buffer substring between BEG and END, after filtering.
The wrapper hook `filter-buffer-substring-functions' performs
the actual filtering.  The obsolete variable `buffer-substring-filters'
is also consulted.  If both of these are nil, no filtering is done.</p>
<p>
If DELETE is non-nil, the text between BEG and END is deleted
from the buffer.</p>
<p>
This function should be used instead of `buffer-substring',
`buffer-substring-no-properties', or `delete-and-extract-region'
when you want to allow filtering to take place.  For example,
major or minor modes can use `filter-buffer-substring-functions' to
extract characters that are special to a buffer, and should not
be copied into other buffers.</p>
