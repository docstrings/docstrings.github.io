<h3>Function: locate-with-filter</h3>
<p>
Run the executable program `locate' with a filter.
This function is similar to the function `locate', which see.
The difference is that, when invoked interactively, the present function
prompts for both SEARCH-STRING and FILTER.  It passes SEARCH-STRING
to the locate executable program.  It produces a `*Locate*' buffer
that lists only those lines in the output of the locate program that
contain a match for the regular expression FILTER; this is often useful
to constrain a big search.</p>
<p>
ARG is the interactive prefix arg, which has the same effect as in `locate'.</p>
<p>
When called from Lisp, this function is identical with `locate',
except that FILTER is not optional.</p>
<p>
(fn SEARCH-STRING FILTER &optional ARG)</p>
