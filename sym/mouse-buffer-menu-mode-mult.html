<h3>Variable: mouse-buffer-menu-mode-mult</h3>
<p>
Group the buffers by the major mode groups on <C-down-mouse-1>?
This number which determines (in a hairy way) whether <C-down-mouse-1>
will split the buffer menu by the major modes (see
`mouse-buffer-menu-mode-groups') or just by menu length.
Set to 1 (or even 0!) if you want to group by major mode always, and to
a large number if you prefer a mixed multitude.  The default is 4.</p>
