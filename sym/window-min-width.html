<h3>Variable: window-min-width</h3>
<p>
The minimum number of columns of any window.
The value has to accommodate margins, fringes, or scrollbars if
present.  A value less than `window-safe-min-width' is ignored.
The value of this variable is honored when windows are resized or
split.</p>
<p>
Applications should never rebind this variable.  To resize a
window to a width less than the one specified here, an
application should instead call `window-resize' with a non-nil
IGNORE argument.  In order to have `split-window' make a window
narrower, explicitly specify the SIZE argument of that function.</p>
