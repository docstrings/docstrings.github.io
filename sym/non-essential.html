<h3>Variable: non-essential</h3>
<p>
Whether the currently executing code is performing an essential task.
This variable should be non-nil only when running code which should not
disturb the user.  E.g. it can be used to prevent Tramp from prompting the
user for a password when we are simply scanning a set of files in the
background or displaying possible completions before the user even asked
for it.</p>
