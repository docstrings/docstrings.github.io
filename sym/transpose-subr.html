Subroutine to do the work of transposing objects.<br>
Works for lines, sentences, paragraphs, etc.  MOVER is a function that<br>
moves forward by units of the given object (e.g. forward-sentence,<br>
forward-paragraph).  If ARG is zero, exchanges the current object<br>

current object past ARG following (if ARG is positive) or<br>
preceding (if ARG is negative) objects, leaving point after the
current object.</p>
