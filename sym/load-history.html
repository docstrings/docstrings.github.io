<h3>Variable: load-history</h3>
<p>
Alist mapping loaded file names to symbols and features.
Each alist element should be a list (FILE-NAME ENTRIES...), where
FILE-NAME is the name of a file that has been loaded into Emacs.
The file name is absolute and true (i.e. it doesn't contain symlinks).
As an exception, one of the alist elements may have FILE-NAME nil,
for symbols and features not associated with any file.</p>
<p>
The remaining ENTRIES in the alist element describe the functions and
variables defined in that file, the features provided, and the
features required.  Each entry has the form `(provide . FEATURE)',
`(require . FEATURE)', `(defun . FUNCTION)', `(autoload . SYMBOL)',
`(defface . SYMBOL)', or `(t . SYMBOL)'.  Entries like `(t . SYMBOL)'
may precede a `(defun . FUNCTION)' entry, and means that SYMBOL was an
autoload before this file redefined it as a function.  In addition,
entries may also be single symbols, which means that SYMBOL was
defined by `defvar' or `defconst'.</p>
<p>
During preloading, the file name recorded is relative to the main Lisp
directory.  These file names are converted to absolute at startup.</p>
