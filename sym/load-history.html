<h3>Variable: load-history</h3>
<p>
Alist mapping loaded file names to symbols and features.<br>
Each alist element should be a list (FILE-NAME ENTRIES...), where<br>
FILE-NAME is the name of a file that has been loaded into Emacs.<br>
The file name is absolute and true (i.e. it doesn't contain symlinks).<br>
As an exception, one of the alist elements may have FILE-NAME nil,<br>
for symbols and features not associated with any file.<br>
<br>
The remaining ENTRIES in the alist element describe the functions and<br>
variables defined in that file, the features provided, and the<br>
features required.  Each entry has the form `(provide . FEATURE)',<br>
`(require . FEATURE)', `(defun . FUNCTION)', `(autoload . SYMBOL)',<br>
`(defface . SYMBOL)', or `(t . SYMBOL)'.  Entries like `(t . SYMBOL)'<br>
may precede a `(defun . FUNCTION)' entry, and means that SYMBOL was an<br>
autoload before this file redefined it as a function.  In addition,<br>
entries may also be single symbols, which means that SYMBOL was<br>
defined by `defvar' or `defconst'.<br>
<br>
During preloading, the file name recorded is relative to the main Lisp
directory.  These file names are converted to absolute at startup.</p>
