<br>
Variables controlling indentation style:<br>
 icon-tab-always-indent<br>
    Non-nil means TAB in Icon mode should always reindent the current line,<br>
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.<br>

    Non-nil means automatically newline before and after braces<br>
    inserted in Icon code.<br>
 icon-indent-level<br>
    Indentation of Icon statements within surrounding block.<br>
    The surrounding block's indentation is the indentation<br>
    of the line on which the open-brace appears.<br>
 icon-continued-statement-offset<br>
    Extra indentation given to a substatement, such as the<br>
    then-clause of an if or body of a while.<br>
 icon-continued-brace-offset<br>
    Extra indentation given to a brace that starts a substatement.<br>
    This is in addition to `icon-continued-statement-offset'.<br>
 icon-brace-offset<br>
    Extra indentation for line if it starts with an open brace.<br>
 icon-brace-imaginary-offset<br>
    An open brace following other text is treated as if it were<br>
    this far to the right of the start of its line.<br>

Turning on Icon mode calls the value of the variable `icon-mode-hook'
with no args, if that value is non-nil.
