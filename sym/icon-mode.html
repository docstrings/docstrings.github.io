Variables controlling indentation style:
 icon-tab-always-indent
    Non-nil means TAB in Icon mode should always reindent the current line,
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 icon-auto-newline
    Non-nil means automatically newline before and after braces
    inserted in Icon code.
 icon-indent-level
    Indentation of Icon statements within surrounding block.
    The surrounding block's indentation is the indentation
    of the line on which the open-brace appears.
 icon-continued-statement-offset
    Extra indentation given to a substatement, such as the
    then-clause of an if or body of a while.
 icon-continued-brace-offset
    Extra indentation given to a brace that starts a substatement.
    This is in addition to `icon-continued-statement-offset'.
 icon-brace-offset
    Extra indentation for line if it starts with an open brace.
 icon-brace-imaginary-offset
    An open brace following other text is treated as if it were
    this far to the right of the start of its line.</p>

with no args, if that value is non-nil.</p>
