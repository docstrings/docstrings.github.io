<h3>Function: where-is-internal</h3>
<p>
Return list of keys that invoke DEFINITION.
If KEYMAP is a keymap, search only KEYMAP and the global keymap.
If KEYMAP is nil, search all the currently active keymaps, except
 for `overriding-local-map' (which is ignored).
If KEYMAP is a list of keymaps, search only those keymaps.</p>
<p>
If optional 3rd arg FIRSTONLY is non-nil, return the first key sequence found,
rather than a list of all possible key sequences.
If FIRSTONLY is the symbol `non-ascii', return the first binding found,
no matter what it is.
If FIRSTONLY has another non-nil value, prefer bindings
that use the modifier key specified in `where-is-preferred-modifier'
(or their meta variants) and entirely reject menu bindings.</p>
<p>
If optional 4th arg NOINDIRECT is non-nil, don't follow indirections
to other keymaps or slots.  This makes it possible to search for an
indirect definition itself.</p>
<p>
The optional 5th arg NO-REMAP alters how command remapping is handled:</p>
<p>
- If another command OTHER-COMMAND is remapped to DEFINITION, normally
  search for the bindings of OTHER-COMMAND and include them in the
  returned list.  But if NO-REMAP is non-nil, include the vector
  [remap OTHER-COMMAND] in the returned list instead, without
  searching for those other bindings.</p>
<p>
- If DEFINITION is remapped to OTHER-COMMAND, normally return the
  bindings for OTHER-COMMAND.  But if NO-REMAP is non-nil, return the
  bindings for DEFINITION instead, ignoring its remapping.</p>
