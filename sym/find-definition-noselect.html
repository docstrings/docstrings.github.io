<h3>Function: find-definition-noselect</h3>
<p>
Return a pair `(BUFFER . POINT)' pointing to the definition of SYMBOL.<br>
If the definition can't be found in the buffer, return (BUFFER).<br>
TYPE says what type of definition: nil for a function, `defvar' for a<br>
variable, `defface' for a face.  This function does not switch to the<br>
buffer nor display it.<br>
<br>
The library where SYMBOL is defined is searched for in FILE or<br>
`find-function-source-path', if non-nil, otherwise in `load-path'.<br>

(fn SYMBOL TYPE &optional FILE)</p>
