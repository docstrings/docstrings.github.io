<h3>Function: find-definition-noselect</h3>
<p>
Return a pair `(BUFFER . POINT)' pointing to the definition of SYMBOL.
If the definition can't be found in the buffer, return (BUFFER).
TYPE says what type of definition: nil for a function, `defvar' for a
variable, `defface' for a face.  This function does not switch to the
buffer nor display it.</p>
<p>
The library where SYMBOL is defined is searched for in FILE or
`find-function-source-path', if non-nil, otherwise in `load-path'.</p>
<p>
(fn SYMBOL TYPE &optional FILE)</p>
