<h3>Function: read-file-name</h3>
<p>
Read file name, prompting with PROMPT and completing in directory DIR.
Value is not expanded---you must call `expand-file-name' yourself.</p>
<p>
DIR is the directory to use for completing relative file names.
It should be an absolute directory name, or nil (which means the
current buffer's value of `default-directory').</p>
<p>
DEFAULT-FILENAME specifies the default file name to return if the
user exits the minibuffer with the same non-empty string inserted
by this function.  If DEFAULT-FILENAME is a string, that serves
as the default.  If DEFAULT-FILENAME is a list of strings, the
first string is the default.  If DEFAULT-FILENAME is omitted or
nil, then if INITIAL is non-nil, the default is DIR combined with
INITIAL; otherwise, if the current buffer is visiting a file,
that file serves as the default; otherwise, the default is simply
the string inserted into the minibuffer.</p>
<p>
If the user exits with an empty minibuffer, return an empty
string.  (This happens only if the user erases the pre-inserted
contents, or if `insert-default-directory' is nil.)</p>
<p>
Fourth arg MUSTMATCH can take the following values:
- nil means that the user can exit with any input.
- t means that the user is not allowed to exit unless
  the input is (or completes to) an existing file.
- `confirm' means that the user can exit with any input, but she needs
  to confirm her choice if the input is not an existing file.
- `confirm-after-completion' means that the user can exit with any
  input, but she needs to confirm her choice if she called
  `minibuffer-complete' right before `minibuffer-complete-and-exit'
  and the input is not an existing file.
- anything else behaves like t except that typing RET does not exit if it
  does non-null completion.</p>
<p>
Fifth arg INITIAL specifies text to start with.</p>
<p>
Sixth arg PREDICATE, if non-nil, should be a function of one
argument; then a file name is considered an acceptable completion
alternative only if PREDICATE returns non-nil with the file name
as its argument.</p>
<p>
If this command was invoked with the mouse, use a graphical file
dialog if `use-dialog-box' is non-nil, and the window system or X
toolkit in use provides a file dialog box, and DIR is not a
remote file.  For graphical file dialogs, any of the special values
of MUSTMATCH `confirm' and `confirm-after-completion' are
treated as equivalent to nil.  Some graphical file dialogs respect
a MUSTMATCH value of t, and some do not (or it only has a cosmetic
effect, and does not actually prevent the user from entering a
non-existent file).</p>
