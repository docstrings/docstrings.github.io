<h3>Function: find-file-at-point</h3>
<p>
Find FILENAME, guessing a default from text around point.<br>
If `ffap-url-regexp' is not nil, the FILENAME may also be an URL.<br>
With a prefix, this command behaves exactly like `ffap-file-finder'.<br>
If `ffap-require-prefix' is set, the prefix meaning is reversed.<br>
See also the variables `ffap-dired-wildcards', `ffap-newfile-prompt',<br>
and the functions `ffap-file-at-point' and `ffap-url-at-point'.<br>

(fn &optional FILENAME)</p>
