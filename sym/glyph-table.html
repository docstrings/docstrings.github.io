<h3>Variable: glyph-table</h3>
<p>
Table defining how to output a glyph code to the frame.
If not nil, this is a vector indexed by glyph code to define the glyph.
Each element can be:
 integer: a glyph code which this glyph is an alias for.
 string: output this glyph using that string (not impl. in X windows).
 nil: this glyph mod 524288 is the code of a character to output,
    and this glyph / 524288 is the face number (see `face-id') to use
    while outputting it.</p>
