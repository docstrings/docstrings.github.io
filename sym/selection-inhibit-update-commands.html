<h3>Variable: selection-inhibit-update-commands</h3>
<p>
List of commands which should not update the selection.<br>
Normally, if `select-active-regions' is non-nil and the mark remains<br>
active after a command (i.e. the mark was not deactivated), the Emacs<br>
command loop sets the selection to the text in the region.  However,<br>
if the command is in this list, the selection is not updated.</p>
