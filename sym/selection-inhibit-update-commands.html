<h3>Variable: selection-inhibit-update-commands</h3>
<p>
List of commands which should not update the selection.
Normally, if `select-active-regions' is non-nil and the mark remains
active after a command (i.e. the mark was not deactivated), the Emacs
command loop sets the selection to the text in the region.  However,
if the command is in this list, the selection is not updated.</p>
