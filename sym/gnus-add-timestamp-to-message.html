<h3>Variable: gnus-add-timestamp-to-message</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means add timestamps to messages that Gnus issues.
If it is `log', add timestamps to only the messages that go into the
"*Messages*" buffer (in XEmacs, it is the " *Message-Log*" buffer).
If it is neither nil nor `log', add timestamps not only to log messages
but also to the ones displayed in the echo area.</p>
