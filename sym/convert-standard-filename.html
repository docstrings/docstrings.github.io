<h3>Function: convert-standard-filename</h3>
<p>
Convert a standard file's name to something suitable for the OS.
This means to guarantee valid names and perhaps to canonicalize
certain patterns.</p>
<p>
FILENAME should be an absolute file name since the conversion rules
sometimes vary depending on the position in the file name.  E.g. c:/foo
is a valid DOS file name, but c:/bar/c:/foo is not.</p>
<p>
This function's standard definition is trivial; it just returns
the argument.  However, on Windows and DOS, replace invalid
characters.  On DOS, make sure to obey the 8.3 limitations.
In the native Windows build, turn Cygwin names into native names,
and also turn slashes into backslashes if the shell requires it (see
`w32-shell-dos-semantics').</p>
