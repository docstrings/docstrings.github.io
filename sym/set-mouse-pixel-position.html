<h3>Function: set-mouse-pixel-position</h3>
<p>
Move the mouse pointer to pixel position (X,Y) in FRAME.
The position is given in pixels, where (0, 0) is the upper-left corner
of the frame, X is the horizontal offset, and Y is the vertical offset.</p>
<p>
Note, this is a no-op for an X frame that is not visible.
If you have just created a frame, you must wait for it to become visible
before calling this function on it, like this.
  (while (not (frame-visible-p frame)) (sleep-for .5))</p>
<p>
(fn FRAME X Y)</p>
