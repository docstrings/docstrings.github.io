<h3>Function: Info-find-node-in-buffer</h3>
<p>
Find a node or anchor in the current buffer.
REGEXP is a regular expression matching nodes or references.  Its first
group should match `Node:' or `Ref:'.
Value is the position at which a match was found, or nil if not found.
This function looks for a case-sensitive match first.  If none is found,
a case-insensitive match is tried.</p>
