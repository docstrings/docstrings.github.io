<h3>Function: round</h3>
<p>
Return the nearest integer to ARG.<br>
With optional DIVISOR, return the nearest integer to ARG/DIVISOR.<br>
<br>
Rounding a value equidistant between two integers may choose the<br>
integer closer to zero, or it may prefer an even integer, depending on<br>
your machine.  For example, (round 2.5) can return 3 on some<br>
systems, but 2 on others.<br>
