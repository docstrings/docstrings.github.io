<h3>Function: vertical-motion</h3>
<p>
Move point to start of the screen line LINES lines down.
If LINES is negative, this means moving up.</p>
<p>
This function is an ordinary cursor motion function
which calculates the new position based on how text would be displayed.
The new position may be the start of a line,
or just the start of a continuation line.
The function returns number of screen lines moved over;
that usually equals LINES, but may be closer to zero
if beginning or end of buffer was reached.</p>
<p>
The optional second argument WINDOW specifies the window to use for
parameters such as width, horizontal scrolling, and so on.
The default is to use the selected window's parameters.</p>
<p>
LINES can optionally take the form (COLS . LINES), in which case
the motion will not stop at the start of a screen line but on
its column COLS (if such exists on that line, that is).</p>
<p>
`vertical-motion' always uses the current buffer,
regardless of which buffer is displayed in WINDOW.
This is consistent with other cursor motion functions
and makes it possible to use `vertical-motion' in any buffer,
whether or not it is currently displayed in some window.</p>
