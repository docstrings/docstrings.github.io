<h3>Variable: saved-region-selection</h3>
<p>
Contents of active region prior to buffer modification.<br>
If `select-active-regions' is non-nil, Emacs sets this to the<br>
text in the region before modifying the buffer.  The next<br>
`deactivate-mark' call uses this to set the window selection.</p>
