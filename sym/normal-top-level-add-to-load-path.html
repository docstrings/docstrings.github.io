<h3>Function: normal-top-level-add-to-load-path</h3>
<p>
This function is called from a subdirs.el file.<br>
It assumes that `default-directory' is the directory in which the<br>
subdirs.el file exists, and it adds to `load-path' the subdirs of<br>
that directory as specified in DIRS.  Normally the elements of<br>
DIRS are relative.
