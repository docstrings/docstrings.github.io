<h3>Variable: paragraph-start</h3>
<p>
Regexp for beginning of a line that starts OR separates paragraphs.
This regexp should match lines that separate paragraphs
and should also match lines that start a paragraph
(and are part of that paragraph).</p>
<p>
This is matched against the text at the left margin, which is not necessarily
the beginning of the line, so it should never use "^" as an anchor.  This
ensures that the paragraph functions will work equally well within a region
of text indented by a margin setting.</p>
<p>
The variable `paragraph-separate' specifies how to distinguish
lines that start paragraphs from lines that separate them.</p>
<p>
If the variable `use-hard-newlines' is non-nil, then only lines following a
hard newline are considered to match.</p>
