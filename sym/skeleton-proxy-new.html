<h3>Function: skeleton-proxy-new</h3>
<p>
Insert SKELETON.
Prefix ARG allows wrapping around words or regions (see `skeleton-insert').
If no ARG was given, but the region is visible, ARG defaults to -1 depending
on `skeleton-autowrap'.  An ARG of  M-0  will prevent this just for once.
This command can also be an abbrev expansion (3rd and 4th columns in
M-x edit-abbrevs  buffer: ""  command-name).</p>
<p>
Optional second argument STR may also be a string which will be the value
of `str' whereas the skeleton's interactor is then ignored.</p>
<p>
(fn SKELETON &optional STR ARG)</p>
