<h3>Function: called-interactively-p</h3>
<p>
Return t if the containing function was called by `call-interactively'.
If KIND is `interactive', then only return t if the call was made
interactively by the user, i.e. not in `noninteractive' mode nor
when `executing-kbd-macro'.
If KIND is `any', on the other hand, it will return t for any kind of
interactive call, including being called as the binding of a key, or
from a keyboard macro, or in `noninteractive' mode.</p>
<p>
The only known proper use of `interactive' for KIND is in deciding
whether to display a helpful message, or how to display it.  If you're
thinking of using it for any other purpose, it is quite likely that
you're making a mistake.  Think: what do you want to do when the
command is called from a keyboard macro?</p>
<p>
Instead of using this function, it is sometimes cleaner to give your
function an extra optional argument whose `interactive' spec specifies
non-nil unconditionally ("p" is a good way to do this), or via
(not (or executing-kbd-macro noninteractive)).</p>
