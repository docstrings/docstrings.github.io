<h3>Function: prin1-to-string</h3>
<p>
Return a string containing the printed representation of OBJECT.
OBJECT can be any Lisp object.  This function outputs quoting characters
when necessary to make output that `read' can handle, whenever possible,
unless the optional second argument NOESCAPE is non-nil.  For complex objects,
the behavior is controlled by `print-level' and `print-length', which see.</p>
<p>
OBJECT is any of the Lisp data types: a number, a string, a symbol,
a list, a buffer, a window, a frame, etc.</p>
<p>
A printed representation of an object is text which describes that object.</p>
<p>
(fn OBJECT &optional NOESCAPE)</p>
