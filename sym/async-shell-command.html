<h3>Function: async-shell-command</h3>
<p>
Execute string COMMAND asynchronously in background.<br>
<br>
Like `shell-command', but adds `&' at the end of COMMAND<br>
to execute it asynchronously.<br>
<br>
The output appears in the buffer `*Async Shell Command*'.<br>
That buffer is in shell mode.<br>
<br>
In Elisp, you will often be better served by calling `start-process'<br>
directly, since it offers more control and does not impose the use of a<br>
shell (with its need to quote arguments).</p>
