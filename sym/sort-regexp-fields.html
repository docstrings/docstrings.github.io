<h3>Function: sort-regexp-fields</h3>
<p>
Sort the text in the region region lexicographically.
If called interactively, prompt for two regular expressions,
RECORD-REGEXP and KEY-REGEXP.</p>
<p>
RECORD-REGEXP specifies the textual units to be sorted.
  For example, to sort lines, RECORD-REGEXP would be "^.*$".</p>
<p>
KEY-REGEXP specifies the part of each record (i.e. each match for
  RECORD-REGEXP) to be used for sorting.
  If it is "\\digit", use the digit'th "\\(...\\)"
  match field specified by RECORD-REGEXP.
  If it is "\\&", use the whole record.
  Otherwise, KEY-REGEXP should be a regular expression with which
  to search within the record.  If a match for KEY-REGEXP is not
  found within a record, that record is ignored.</p>
<p>
With a negative prefix arg, sort in reverse order.</p>
<p>
The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects
the sort order.</p>
<p>
For example: to sort lines in the region by the first word on each line
 starting with the letter "f",
 RECORD-REGEXP would be "^.*$" and KEY would be "\\<f\\w*\\>"</p>
<p>
(fn REVERSE RECORD-REGEXP KEY-REGEXP BEG END)</p>
