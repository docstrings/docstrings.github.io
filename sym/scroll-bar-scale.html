<h3>Function: scroll-bar-scale</h3>
<p>
Given a pair (NUM . DENOM) and WHOLE, return (/ (* NUM WHOLE) DENOM).<br>
This is handy for scaling a position on a scroll bar into real units,<br>
like buffer positions.  If SCROLL-BAR-POS is the (PORTION . WHOLE) pair<br>
from a scroll bar event, then (scroll-bar-scale SCROLL-BAR-POS<br>
(buffer-size)) is the position in the current buffer corresponding to<br>
that scroll bar position.</p>
