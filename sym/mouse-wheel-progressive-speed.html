<h3>Variable: mouse-wheel-progressive-speed</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, the faster the user moves the wheel, the faster the scrolling.<br>
Note that this has no effect when `mouse-wheel-scroll-amount' specifies<br>
a "near full screen" scroll or when the mouse wheel sends key instead<br>
of button events.</p>
