<h3>Function: pr-ps-fast-fire</h3>
<p>
Fast fire function for PostScript printing.</p>
<p>
If a region is active, the region will be printed instead of the whole buffer.
Also if the current major-mode is defined in `pr-mode-alist', the settings in
`pr-mode-alist' will be used, that is, the current buffer or region will be
printed using `pr-ps-mode-ps-print'.</p>
<p>

Interactively, you have the following situations:</p>
<p>
   M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET
      The command prompts the user for a N-UP value and printing will
      immediately be done using the current active printer.</p>
<p>
   C-u   M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET
   C-u 0 M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET
      The command prompts the user for a N-UP value and also for a current
      PostScript printer, then printing will immediately be done using the new
      current active printer.</p>
<p>
   C-u 1 M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET
      The command prompts the user for a N-UP value and also for a file name,
      and saves the PostScript image in that file instead of sending it to the
      printer.</p>
<p>
   C-u 2 M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET
      The command prompts the user for a N-UP value, then for a current
      PostScript printer and, finally, for a file name.  Then change the active
      printer to that chosen by user and saves the PostScript image in
      that file instead of sending it to the printer.</p>
<p>

Noninteractively, the argument N-UP should be a positive integer greater than
zero and the argument SELECT is treated as follows:</p>
<p>
   If it's nil, send the image to the printer.</p>
<p>
   If it's a list or an integer lesser or equal to zero, the command prompts
   the user for a current PostScript printer, then printing will immediately
   be done using the new current active printer.</p>
<p>
   If it's an integer equal to 1, the command prompts the user for a file name
   and saves the PostScript image in that file instead of sending it to the
   printer.</p>
<p>
   If it's an integer greater or equal to 2, the command prompts the user for a
   current PostScript printer and for a file name.  Then change the active
   printer to that chosen by user and saves the PostScript image in that file
   instead of sending it to the printer.</p>
<p>
   If it's a symbol which it's defined in `pr-ps-printer-alist', it's the new
   active printer and printing will immediately be done using the new active
   printer.</p>
<p>
   Otherwise, send the image to the printer.</p>
<p>

Note that this command always behaves as if `pr-auto-region' and `pr-auto-mode'
are both set to t.</p>
<p>
(fn N-UP &optional SELECT)</p>
