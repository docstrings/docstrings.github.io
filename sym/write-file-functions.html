<h3>Variable: write-file-functions</h3>
<p>
List of functions to be called before writing out a buffer to a file.<br>
If one of them returns non-nil, the file is considered already written<br>
and the rest are not called.<br>
These hooks are considered to pertain to the visited file.<br>
So any buffer-local binding of this variable is discarded if you change<br>
the visited file name with M-x set-visited-file-name, but not when you<br>
change the major mode.<br>
<br>
This hook is not run if any of the functions in<br>
`write-contents-functions' returns non-nil.  Both hooks pertain<br>
to how to save a buffer to file, for instance, choosing a suitable<br>
coding system and setting mode bits.  (See Info<br>
node `(elisp)Saving Buffers'.)  To perform various checks or<br>
updates before the buffer is saved, use `before-save-hook'.</p>
