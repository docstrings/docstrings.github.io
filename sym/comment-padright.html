<h3>Function: comment-padright</h3>
<p>
Construct a string composed of STR plus `comment-padding'.
It also adds N copies of the last non-whitespace chars of STR.
If STR already contains padding, the corresponding amount is
ignored from `comment-padding'.
N defaults to 0.
If N is `re', a regexp is returned instead, that would match
the string for any N.</p>
<p>
(fn STR &optional N)</p>
