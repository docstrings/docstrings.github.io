<h3>Function: woman</h3>
<p>
Browse UN*X man page for TOPIC (Without using external Man program).
The major browsing mode used is essentially the standard Man mode.
Choose the filename for the man page using completion, based on the
topic selected from the directories specified in `woman-manpath' and
`woman-path'.  The directory expansions and topics are cached for
speed, but a non-nil interactive argument forces the caches to be
updated (e.g. to re-interpret the current directory).</p>
<p>
Used non-interactively, arguments are optional: if given then TOPIC
should be a topic string and non-nil RE-CACHE forces re-caching.</p>
