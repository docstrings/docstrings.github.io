<h3>Function: run-python</h3>
<p>
Run an inferior Python process.
Input and output via buffer named after
`python-shell-buffer-name'.  If there is a process already
running in that buffer, just switch to it.</p>
<p>
With argument, allows you to define CMD so you can edit the
command used to call the interpreter and define DEDICATED, so a
dedicated process for the current buffer is open.  When numeric
prefix arg is other than 0 or 4 do not SHOW.</p>
<p>
Runs the hook `inferior-python-mode-hook' (after the
`comint-mode-hook' is run).  (Type C-h m in the
process buffer for a list of commands.)</p>
<p>
(fn CMD &optional DEDICATED SHOW)</p>
