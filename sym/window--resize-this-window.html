<h3>Function: window--resize-this-window</h3>
<p>
Resize WINDOW vertically by DELTA lines.
Optional argument HORIZONTAL non-nil means resize WINDOW
horizontally by DELTA columns.</p>
<p>
Optional argument IGNORE non-nil means ignore restrictions
imposed by fixed size windows, `window-min-height' or
`window-min-width' settings.  If IGNORE equals `safe', live
windows may get as small as `window-safe-min-height' lines and
`window-safe-min-width' columns.  If IGNORE is a window, ignore
restrictions for that window only.  Any other non-nil value
means ignore all of the above restrictions for all windows.</p>
<p>
Optional argument ADD non-nil means add DELTA to the new total
size of WINDOW.</p>
<p>
Optional arguments TRAIL and EDGE, when non-nil, refine the set
of windows that shall be resized.  If TRAIL equals `before',
resize only windows on the left or above EDGE.  If TRAIL equals
`after', resize only windows on the right or below EDGE.  Also,
preferably only resize windows adjacent to EDGE.</p>
<p>
This function recursively resizes WINDOW's child windows to fit the
new size.  Make sure that WINDOW is `window--resizable' before
calling this function.  Note that this function does not resize
siblings of WINDOW or WINDOW's parent window.  You have to
eventually call `window-resize-apply' in order to make resizing
actually take effect.</p>
