<h3>Function: add-hook</h3>
<p>
Add to the value of HOOK the function FUNCTION.
FUNCTION is not added if already present.
FUNCTION is added (if necessary) at the beginning of the hook list
unless the optional argument APPEND is non-nil, in which case
FUNCTION is added at the end.</p>
<p>
The optional fourth argument, LOCAL, if non-nil, says to modify
the hook's buffer-local value rather than its global value.
This makes the hook buffer-local, and it makes t a member of the
buffer-local value.  That acts as a flag to run the hook
functions of the global value as well as in the local value.</p>
<p>
HOOK should be a symbol, and FUNCTION may be any valid function.  If
HOOK is void, it is first set to nil.  If HOOK's value is a single
function, it is changed to a list of functions.</p>
