<h3>Function: view-file</h3>
<p>
View FILE in View mode, returning to previous buffer when done.
Emacs commands editing the buffer contents are not available; instead, a
special set of commands (mostly letters and punctuation) are defined for
moving around in the buffer.
Space scrolls forward, Delete scrolls backward.
For a list of all View commands, type H or h while viewing.</p>
<p>
This command runs the normal hook `view-mode-hook'.</p>
