<h3>Function: c-set-style</h3>
<p>
Set the current buffer to use the style STYLENAME.
STYLENAME, a string, must be an existing CC Mode style - These are contained
in the variable `c-style-alist'.</p>
<p>
The variable `c-indentation-style' will get set to STYLENAME.</p>
<p>
"Setting the style" is done by setting CC Mode's "style variables" to the
values indicated by the pertinent entry in `c-style-alist'.  Other variables
might get set too.</p>
<p>
If DONT-OVERRIDE is neither nil nor t, style variables whose default values
have been set (more precisely, whose default values are not the symbol
`set-from-style') will not be changed.  This avoids overriding global settings
done in your init file.  It is useful to call c-set-style from a mode hook
in this way.</p>
<p>
If DONT-OVERRIDE is t, style variables that already have values (i.e., whose
values are not the symbol `set-from-style') will not be overridden.  CC Mode
calls c-set-style internally in this way whilst initializing a buffer; if
cc-set-style is called like this from anywhere else, it will usually behave as
a null operation.</p>
