String to send in the Accept-language: field in HTTP requests.</p>
<p>
Specifies the preferred language when servers can serve documents in
several languages.  Use RFC 1766 abbreviations, e.g.: `en' for
English, `de' for German.  A comma-separated specifies descending
order of preference.  The ordering can be made explicit using `q'
factors defined by HTTP, e.g. `de,en-gb;q=0.8,en;q=0.7'.  `*' means
get the first available language (as opposed to the default).</p>
