<h3>Variable: jka-compr-load-suffixes</h3>
<p>
List of compression related suffixes to try when loading files.
Enabling Auto Compression mode appends this list to `load-file-rep-suffixes',
which see.  Disabling Auto Compression mode removes all suffixes
from `load-file-rep-suffixes' that enabling added.</p>
<p>
If you set this outside Custom while Auto Compression mode is
already enabled (as it is by default), you have to call
`jka-compr-update' after setting it to properly update other
variables.  Setting this through Custom does that automatically.</p>
