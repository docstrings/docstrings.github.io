<h3>Variable: jka-compr-load-suffixes</h3>
<p>
List of compression related suffixes to try when loading files.<br>
Enabling Auto Compression mode appends this list to `load-file-rep-suffixes',<br>
which see.  Disabling Auto Compression mode removes all suffixes<br>
from `load-file-rep-suffixes' that enabling added.<br>
<br>
If you set this outside Custom while Auto Compression mode is<br>
already enabled (as it is by default), you have to call<br>
`jka-compr-update' after setting it to properly update other<br>
variables.  Setting this through Custom does that automatically.</p>
