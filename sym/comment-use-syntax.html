<h3>Variable: comment-use-syntax</h3>
<p>
Non-nil if syntax-tables can be used instead of regexps.<br>
Can also be `undecided' which means that a somewhat expensive test will<br>
be used to try to determine whether syntax-tables should be trusted<br>
to understand comments or not in the given buffer.<br>
Major modes should set this variable.</p>
