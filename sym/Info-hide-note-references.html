<h3>Variable: Info-hide-note-references</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, hide the tag and section reference in *note and * menu items.<br>
If value is non-nil but not `hide', also replaces the "*note" with "see".<br>
If value is non-nil but not t or `hide', the reference section is still shown.<br>
`nil' completely disables this feature.  If this is non-nil, you might<br>
want to set `Info-refill-paragraphs'.</p>
