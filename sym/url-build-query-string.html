<h3>Function: url-build-query-string</h3>
<p>
Build a query-string.</p>
<p>
Given a QUERY in the form:
'((key1 val1)
  (key2 val2)
  (key3 val1 val2)
  (key4)
  (key5 ""))</p>
<p>
(This is the same format as produced by `url-parse-query-string')</p>
<p>
This will return a string
"key1=val1&key2=val2&key3=val1&key3=val2&key4&key5". Keys may
be strings or symbols; if they are symbols, the symbol name will
be used.</p>
<p>
When SEMICOLONS is given, the separator will be ";".</p>
<p>
When KEEP-EMPTY is given, empty values will show as "key="
instead of just "key" as in the example above.</p>
