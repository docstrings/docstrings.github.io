<h3>Function: cl-mapcar</h3>
<p>
Apply FUNCTION to each element of SEQ, and make a list of the results.
If there are several SEQs, FUNCTION is called with that many arguments,
and mapping stops as soon as the shortest list runs out.  With just one
SEQ, this is like `mapcar'.  With several, it is like the Common Lisp
`mapcar' function extended to arbitrary sequence types.</p>

(fn FUNCTION SEQ...)</p>
