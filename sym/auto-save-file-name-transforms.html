<h3>Variable: auto-save-file-name-transforms</h3>
<p>
Transforms to apply to buffer file name before making auto-save file name.
Each transform is a list (REGEXP REPLACEMENT UNIQUIFY):
REGEXP is a regular expression to match against the file name.
If it matches, `replace-match' is used to replace the
matching part with REPLACEMENT.
If the optional element UNIQUIFY is non-nil, the auto-save file name is
constructed by taking the directory part of the replaced file-name,
concatenated with the buffer file name with all directory separators
changed to `!' to prevent clashes.  This will not work
correctly if your filesystem truncates the resulting name.</p>
<p>
All the transforms in the list are tried, in the order they are listed.
When one transform applies, its result is final;
no further transforms are tried.</p>
<p>
The default value is set up to put the auto-save file into the
temporary directory (see the variable `temporary-file-directory') for
editing a remote file.</p>
<p>
On MS-DOS filesystems without long names this variable is always
ignored.</p>
