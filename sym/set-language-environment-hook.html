<h3>Variable: set-language-environment-hook</h3>
<p>
Normal hook run after some language environment is set.</p>
<p>
When you set some hook function here, that effect usually should not
be inherited to another language environment.  So, you had better set
another function in `exit-language-environment-hook' (which see) to
cancel the effect.</p>
