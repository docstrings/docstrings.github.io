<h3>Function: tpu-mapper</h3>
<p>
Create an Emacs lisp file defining the TPU-edt keypad for X-windows.</p>
<p>
This command displays an instruction screen showing the TPU-edt keypad
and asks you to press the TPU-edt editing keys.  It uses the keys you
press to create an Emacs Lisp file that will define a TPU-edt keypad
for your X server.  You can even re-arrange the standard EDT keypad to
suit your tastes (or to cope with those silly Sun and PC keypads).</p>
<p>
Finally, you will be prompted for the name of the file to store the key
definitions.  If you chose the default, TPU-edt will find it and load it
automatically.  If you specify a different file name, you will need to
set the variable ``tpu-xkeys-file'' before starting TPU-edt.  Here's how
you might go about doing that in your init file.</p>
<p>
  (setq tpu-xkeys-file (expand-file-name "~/.my-emacs-x-keys"))
  (tpu-edt)</p>
<p>
Known Problems:</p>
<p>
Sometimes, tpu-mapper will ignore a key you press, and just continue to
prompt for the same key.  This can happen when your window manager sucks
up the key and doesn't pass it on to Emacs, or it could be an Emacs bug.
Either way, there's nothing that tpu-mapper can do about it.  You must
press RETURN, to skip the current key and continue.  Later, you and/or
your local X guru can try to figure out why the key is being ignored.</p>
