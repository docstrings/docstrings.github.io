<h3>Variable: process-file-side-effects</h3>
<p>
Whether a call of `process-file' changes remote files.<br>
<br>
By default, this variable is always set to `t', meaning that a<br>
call of `process-file' could potentially change any file on a<br>
remote host.  When set to `nil', a file handler could optimize<br>
its behavior with respect to remote file attribute caching.<br>
<br>
You should only ever change this variable with a let-binding;
never with `setq'.</p>
