<h3>Function: mouse-avoidance-mode</h3>
<p>
Set Mouse Avoidance mode to MODE.
MODE should be one of the symbols `banish', `exile', `jump', `animate',
`cat-and-mouse', `proteus', or `none'.</p>
<p>
If MODE is nil, toggle mouse avoidance between `none' and `banish'
modes.  Positive numbers and symbols other than the above are treated
as equivalent to `banish'; negative numbers and `-' are equivalent to `none'.</p>
<p>
Effects of the different modes:
 * banish: Move the mouse to the upper-right corner on any keypress.
 * exile: Move the mouse to the corner only if the cursor gets too close,
     and allow it to return once the cursor is out of the way.
 * jump: If the cursor gets too close to the mouse, displace the mouse
     a random distance & direction.
 * animate: As `jump', but shows steps along the way for illusion of motion.
 * cat-and-mouse: Same as `animate'.
 * proteus: As `animate', but changes the shape of the mouse pointer too.</p>
<p>
Whenever the mouse is moved, the frame is also raised.</p>
<p>
(See `mouse-avoidance-threshold' for definition of "too close",
and `mouse-avoidance-nudge-dist' and `mouse-avoidance-nudge-var' for
definition of "random distance".)</p>
