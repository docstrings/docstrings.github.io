<h3>Function: gpm-mouse-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle mouse support in GNU/Linux consoles (GPM Mouse mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable GPM Mouse mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
This allows the use of the mouse when operating on a GNU/Linux console,
in the same way as you can use the mouse under X11.
It relies on the `gpm' daemon being activated.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional ARG)</p>
<h3>Variable: gpm-mouse-mode</h3>
<p>
Non-nil if Gpm-Mouse mode is enabled.
See the command `gpm-mouse-mode' for a description of this minor mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')
or call the function `gpm-mouse-mode'.</p>
