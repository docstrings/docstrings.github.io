<h3>Function: assoc-default</h3>
<p>
Find object KEY in a pseudo-alist ALIST.
ALIST is a list of conses or objects.  Each element
 (or the element's car, if it is a cons) is compared with KEY by
 calling TEST, with two arguments: (i) the element or its car,
 and (ii) KEY.
If that is non-nil, the element matches; then `assoc-default'
 returns the element's cdr, if it is a cons, or DEFAULT if the
 element is not a cons.</p>
<p>
If no element matches, the value is nil.
If TEST is omitted or nil, `equal' is used.</p>
