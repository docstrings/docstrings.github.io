<h3>Function: lower-frame</h3>
<p>
Send FRAME to the back, so it is occluded by any frames that overlap it.<br>
If you don't specify a frame, the selected frame is used.<br>
If Emacs is displaying on an ordinary terminal or some other device which<br>
doesn't support multiple overlapping frames, this function does nothing.<br>
<br>
(fn &optional FRAME)</p>
