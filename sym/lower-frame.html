<h3>Function: lower-frame</h3>
<p>
Send FRAME to the back, so it is occluded by any frames that overlap it.
If you don't specify a frame, the selected frame is used.
If Emacs is displaying on an ordinary terminal or some other device which
doesn't support multiple overlapping frames, this function does nothing.</p>
