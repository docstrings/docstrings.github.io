<h3>Function: ange-ftp-re-read-dir</h3>
<p>
Reread remote directory DIR to update the directory cache.
The implementation of remote FTP file names caches directory contents
for speed.  Therefore, when new remote files are created, Emacs
may not know they exist.  You can use this command to reread a specific
directory, so that Emacs will know its current contents.</p>
