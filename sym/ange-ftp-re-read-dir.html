<h3>Function: ange-ftp-re-read-dir</h3>
<p>
Reread remote directory DIR to update the directory cache.<br>
The implementation of remote FTP file names caches directory contents<br>
for speed.  Therefore, when new remote files are created, Emacs<br>
may not know they exist.  You can use this command to reread a specific<br>
directory, so that Emacs will know its current contents.<br>
