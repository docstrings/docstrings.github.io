<h3>Function: debug</h3>
<p>
Enter debugger.  `c' returns from the debugger.<br>
Arguments are mainly for use when this is called from the internals<br>
of the evaluator.<br>
<br>
You may call with no args, or you may pass nil as the first arg and<br>
any other args you like.  In that case, the list of args after the<br>
first will be printed into the backtrace buffer.</p>
