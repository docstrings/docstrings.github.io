<h3>Variable: x-select-enable-clipboard</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means cutting and pasting uses the clipboard.<br>
This is in addition to, but in preference to, the primary selection.<br>
<br>
Note that MS-Windows does not support selection types other than the<br>
clipboard.  (The primary selection that is set by Emacs is not<br>
accessible to other programs on MS-Windows.)<br>
<br>
This variable is not used by the Nextstep port.</p>
