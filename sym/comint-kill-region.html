<h3>Function: comint-kill-region</h3>
<p>
Like `kill-region', but ignores read-only properties, if safe.
This command assumes that the buffer contains read-only
"prompts" which are regions with front-sticky read-only
properties at the beginning of a line, with the preceding newline
being read-only to protect the prompt.  This is true of the
comint prompts if `comint-prompt-read-only' is non-nil.  This
command will not delete the region if this would create mutilated
or out of place prompts.  That is, if any part of a prompt is
deleted, the entire prompt must be deleted and all remaining
prompts should stay at the beginning of a line.  If this is not
the case, this command just calls `kill-region' with all
read-only properties intact.  The read-only status of newlines is
updated using `comint-update-fence', if necessary.</p>
