Major mode for editing mail to be sent.
Like Text Mode but with these additional commands:</p>
<p>
M-x mail-send  mail-send (send the message)
M-x mail-send-and-exit  mail-send-and-exit (send the message and exit)</p>
<p>
Here are commands that move to a header field (and create it if there isn't):
	 M-x mail-to  move to To:	M-x mail-subject  move to Subj:
	 M-x mail-bcc  move to BCC:	M-x mail-cc  move to CC:
	 M-x mail-fcc  move to FCC:	M-x mail-reply-to move to Reply-To:
         M-x mail-mail-reply-to  move to Mail-Reply-To:
         M-x mail-mail-followup-to move to Mail-Followup-To:
M-x mail-text  move to message text.
M-x mail-signature  mail-signature (insert `mail-signature-file' file).
M-x mail-yank-original  mail-yank-original (insert current message, in Rmail).
M-x mail-fill-yanked-message  mail-fill-yanked-message (fill what was yanked).
