<h3>Function: ebnf-print-buffer</h3>
<p>
Generate and print a PostScript syntactic chart image of the buffer.</p>
<p>
When called with a numeric prefix argument (C-u), prompts the user for
the name of a file to save the PostScript image in, instead of sending
it to the printer.</p>
<p>
More specifically, the FILENAME argument is treated as follows: if it
is nil, send the image to the printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save
the PostScript image in a file with that name.  If FILENAME is a
number, prompt the user for the name of the file to save in.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional FILENAME)</p>
