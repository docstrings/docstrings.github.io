<p>
Return the binding for command KEYS in current global keymap only.<br>
KEYS is a string or vector, a sequence of keystrokes.<br>
The binding is probably a symbol with a function definition.<br>
This function's return values are the same as those of `lookup-key'<br>
(which see).<br>
<br>
If optional argument ACCEPT-DEFAULT is non-nil, recognize default<br>
bindings; see the description of `lookup-key' for more details about this.<br>
