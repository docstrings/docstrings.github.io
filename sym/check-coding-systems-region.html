<h3>Function: check-coding-systems-region</h3>
<p>
Check if the region is encodable by coding systems.</p>
<p>
START and END are buffer positions specifying the region.
CODING-SYSTEM-LIST is a list of coding systems to check.</p>
<p>
The value is an alist ((CODING-SYSTEM POS0 POS1 ...) ...), where
CODING-SYSTEM is a member of CODING-SYSTEM-LIST and can't encode the
whole region, POS0, POS1, ... are buffer positions where non-encodable
characters are found.</p>
<p>
If all coding systems in CODING-SYSTEM-LIST can encode the region, the
value is nil.</p>
<p>
START may be a string.  In that case, check if the string is
encodable, and the value contains indices to the string instead of
buffer positions.  END is ignored.</p>
<p>
If the current buffer (or START if it is a string) is unibyte, the value
is nil.</p>
<p>
(fn START END CODING-SYSTEM-LIST)</p>
