<h3>Variable: Info-search-whitespace-regexp</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, regular expression to match a sequence of whitespace chars.
This applies to Info search for regular expressions.
You might want to use something like "[ \t\r\n]+" instead.
In the Customization buffer, that is `[' followed by a space,
a tab, a carriage return (control-M), a newline, and `]+'.</p>
