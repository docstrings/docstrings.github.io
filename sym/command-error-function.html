<h3>Variable: command-error-function</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, function to output error messages.<br>
The arguments are the error data, a list of the form<br>
 (SIGNALED-CONDITIONS . SIGNAL-DATA)<br>
such as just as `condition-case' would bind its variable to,<br>
the context (a string which normally goes at the start of the message),<br>
and the Lisp function within which the error was signaled.</p>
