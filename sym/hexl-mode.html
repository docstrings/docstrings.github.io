<h3>Function: hexl-mode</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
Uses keymap `hexl-mode-map', which is not currently defined.
A mode for editing binary files in hex dump format.
This is not an ordinary major mode; it alters some aspects
of the current mode's behavior, but not all; also, you can exit
Hexl mode and return to the previous mode using `hexl-mode-exit'.</p>
<p>
This function automatically converts a buffer into the hexl format
using the function `hexlify-buffer'.</p>
<p>
Each line in the buffer has an "address" (displayed in hexadecimal)
representing the offset into the file that the characters on this line
are at and 16 characters from the file (displayed as hexadecimal
values grouped every `hexl-bits' bits) and as their ASCII values.</p>
<p>
If any of the characters (displayed as ASCII characters) are
unprintable (control or meta characters) they will be replaced as
periods.</p>
<p>
If `hexl-mode' is invoked with an argument the buffer is assumed to be
in hexl format.</p>
<p>
A sample format:</p>

<p>
Movement is as simple as movement in a normal Emacs text buffer.  Most
cursor movement bindings are the same: use M-x hexl-backward-char, M-x hexl-forward-char, M-x hexl-next-line, and M-x hexl-previous-line
to move the cursor left, right, down, and up.</p>
<p>
Advanced cursor movement commands (ala M-x hexl-beginning-of-line, M-x hexl-end-of-line, M-x hexl-beginning-of-buffer, and M-x hexl-end-of-buffer) are
also supported.</p>
<p>
There are several ways to change text in hexl mode:</p>
<p>
ASCII characters (character between space (0x20) and tilde (0x7E)) are
bound to self-insert so you can simply type the character and it will
insert itself (actually overstrike) into the buffer.</p>
<p>
M-x hexl-quoted-insert followed by another keystroke allows you to insert the key even if
it isn't bound to self-insert.  An octal number can be supplied in place
of another key to insert the octal number's ASCII representation.</p>
<p>
M-x hexl-insert-hex-char will insert a given hexadecimal value (if it is between 0 and 0xFF)
into the buffer at the current point.</p>
<p>
M-x hexl-insert-octal-char will insert a given octal value (if it is between 0 and 0377)
into the buffer at the current point.</p>
<p>
M-x hexl-insert-decimal-char will insert a given decimal value (if it is between 0 and 255)
into the buffer at the current point.</p>
<p>
M-x hexl-mode-exit will exit hexl-mode.</p>
<p>
Note: saving the file with any of the usual Emacs commands
will actually convert it back to binary format while saving.</p>
<p>
You can use M-x hexl-find-file to visit a file in Hexl mode.</p>
<p>
C-h b for advanced commands.</p>
