<h3>Function: batch-byte-compile</h3>
<p>
Run `byte-compile-file' on the files remaining on the command line.<br>
Use this from the command line, with `-batch';<br>
it won't work in an interactive Emacs.<br>
Each file is processed even if an error occurred previously.<br>
For example, invoke "emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile $emacs/ ~/*.el".<br>
If NOFORCE is non-nil, don't recompile a file that seems to be<br>
already up-to-date.
