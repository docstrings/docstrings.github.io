<h3>Function: custom-initialize-default</h3>
<p>
Initialize SYMBOL with VALUE.
This will do nothing if symbol already has a default binding.
Otherwise, if symbol has a `saved-value' property, it will evaluate
the car of that and use it as the default binding for symbol.
Otherwise, VALUE will be evaluated and used as the default binding for
symbol.</p>
