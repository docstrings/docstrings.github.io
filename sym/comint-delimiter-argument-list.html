<h3>Variable: comint-delimiter-argument-list</h3>
<p>
List of characters to recognize as separate arguments in input.<br>
Strings comprising a character in this list will separate the arguments<br>
surrounding them, and also be regarded as arguments in their own right (unlike<br>
whitespace).  See `comint-arguments'.<br>
Defaults to the empty list.<br>
<br>
For shells, a good value is (?\| ?& ?< ?> ?\( ?\) ?;).<br>
<br>
This is a good thing to set in mode hooks.</p>
