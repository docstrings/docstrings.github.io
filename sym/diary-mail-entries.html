<h3>Function: diary-mail-entries</h3>
<p>
Send a mail message showing diary entries for next NDAYS days.
If no prefix argument is given, NDAYS is set to `diary-mail-days'.
Mail is sent to the address specified by `diary-mail-addr'.</p>
<p>
Here is an example of a script to call `diary-mail-entries',
suitable for regular scheduling using cron (or at).  Note that
since `emacs -script' does not load your init file, you should
ensure that all relevant variables are set.</p>
<p>
#!/usr/bin/emacs -script
;; diary-rem.el - run the Emacs diary-reminder</p>
<p>
(setq diary-mail-days 3
      diary-file "/path/to/diary.file"
      calendar-date-style 'european
      diary-mail-addr "user@host.name")</p>
<p>
(diary-mail-entries)</p>
<p>
# diary-rem.el ends here</p>
<p>
(fn &optional NDAYS)</p>
