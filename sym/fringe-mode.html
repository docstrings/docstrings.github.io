<h3>Function: fringe-mode</h3>
<p>
Set the default appearance of fringes on all frames.
When called interactively, query the user for MODE; valid values
are `no-fringes', `default', `left-only', `right-only', `minimal'
and `half-width'.  See `fringe-styles'.</p>
<p>
When used in a Lisp program, MODE should be one of these:
- nil, which means the default width (8 pixels).
- a cons cell (LEFT . RIGHT), where LEFT and RIGHT are
  respectively the left and right fringe widths in pixels, or
  nil (meaning to disable that fringe).
- a single integer, which specifies the pixel widths of both
  fringes.
This command may round up the left and right width specifications
to ensure that their sum is a multiple of the character width of
a frame.  It never rounds up a fringe width of 0.</p>
<p>
Fringe widths set by `set-window-fringes' override the default
fringe widths set by this command.  This command applies to all
frames that exist and frames to be created in the future.  If you
want to set the default appearance of fringes on the selected
frame only, see the command `set-fringe-style'.</p>
<h3>Variable: fringe-mode</h3>
<p>
Default appearance of fringes on all frames.
The Lisp value should be one of the following:
- nil, which means the default width (8 pixels).
- a cons cell (LEFT . RIGHT), where LEFT and RIGHT are
  respectively the left and right fringe widths in pixels, or
  nil (meaning to disable that fringe).
- a single integer, which specifies the pixel widths of both
  fringes.
Note that the actual width may be rounded up to ensure that the
sum of the width of the left and right fringes is a multiple of
the frame's character width.  However, a fringe width of 0 is
never rounded.</p>
<p>
When setting this variable from Customize, the user can choose
from the mnemonic fringe mode names defined in `fringe-styles'.</p>
<p>
When setting this variable in a Lisp program, call
`set-fringe-mode' afterward to make it take real effect.</p>
<p>
To modify the appearance of the fringe in a specific frame, use
the interactive function `set-fringe-style'.</p>
