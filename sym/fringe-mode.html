<h3>Function: fringe-mode</h3>
<p>
Set the default appearance of fringes on all frames.<br>
When called interactively, query the user for MODE; valid values<br>
are `no-fringes', `default', `left-only', `right-only', `minimal'<br>
and `half-width'.  See `fringe-styles'.<br>
<br>
When used in a Lisp program, MODE should be one of these:<br>
- nil, which means the default width (8 pixels).<br>
- a cons cell (LEFT . RIGHT), where LEFT and RIGHT are<br>
  respectively the left and right fringe widths in pixels, or<br>
  nil (meaning to disable that fringe).<br>
- a single integer, which specifies the pixel widths of both<br>
  fringes.<br>
This command may round up the left and right width specifications<br>
to ensure that their sum is a multiple of the character width of<br>
a frame.  It never rounds up a fringe width of 0.<br>
<br>
Fringe widths set by `set-window-fringes' override the default<br>
fringe widths set by this command.  This command applies to all<br>
frames that exist and frames to be created in the future.  If you<br>
want to set the default appearance of fringes on the selected
frame only, see the command `set-fringe-style'.</p>
<h3>Variable: fringe-mode</h3>
<p>
Default appearance of fringes on all frames.<br>
The Lisp value should be one of the following:<br>
- nil, which means the default width (8 pixels).<br>
- a cons cell (LEFT . RIGHT), where LEFT and RIGHT are<br>
  respectively the left and right fringe widths in pixels, or<br>
  nil (meaning to disable that fringe).<br>
- a single integer, which specifies the pixel widths of both<br>
  fringes.<br>
Note that the actual width may be rounded up to ensure that the<br>
sum of the width of the left and right fringes is a multiple of<br>
the frame's character width.  However, a fringe width of 0 is<br>
never rounded.<br>
<br>
When setting this variable from Customize, the user can choose<br>
from the mnemonic fringe mode names defined in `fringe-styles'.<br>
<br>
When setting this variable in a Lisp program, call<br>
`set-fringe-mode' afterward to make it take real effect.<br>
<br>
To modify the appearance of the fringe in a specific frame, use
the interactive function `set-fringe-style'.</p>
