<h3>Variable: after-load-alist</h3>
<p>
An alist of expressions to be evalled when particular files are loaded.<br>
Each element looks like (REGEXP-OR-FEATURE FORMS...).<br>
<br>
REGEXP-OR-FEATURE is either a regular expression to match file names, or<br>
a symbol (a feature name).<br>
<br>
When `load' is run and the file-name argument matches an element's<br>
REGEXP-OR-FEATURE, or when `provide' is run and provides the symbol<br>
REGEXP-OR-FEATURE, the FORMS in the element are executed.<br>
<br>
An error in FORMS does not undo the load, but does prevent execution of
the rest of the FORMS.</p>
