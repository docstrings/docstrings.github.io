<h3>Variable: after-load-alist</h3>
<p>
An alist of expressions to be evalled when particular files are loaded.
Each element looks like (REGEXP-OR-FEATURE FORMS...).</p>
<p>
REGEXP-OR-FEATURE is either a regular expression to match file names, or
a symbol (a feature name).</p>
<p>
When `load' is run and the file-name argument matches an element's
REGEXP-OR-FEATURE, or when `provide' is run and provides the symbol
REGEXP-OR-FEATURE, the FORMS in the element are executed.</p>
<p>
An error in FORMS does not undo the load, but does prevent execution of
the rest of the FORMS.</p>
