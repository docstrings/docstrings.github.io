<h3>Variable: lpr-command</h3>
<p>
Name of program for printing a file.<br>
<br>
On MS-DOS and MS-Windows systems, if the value is an empty string then<br>
Emacs will write directly to the printer port named by `printer-name'.<br>
The programs `print' and `nprint' (the standard print programs on<br>
Windows NT and Novell Netware respectively) are handled specially, using<br>
`printer-name' as the destination for output; any other program is<br>
treated like `lpr' except that an explicit filename is given as the last
argument.</p>
