<h3>Variable: unread-command-events</h3>
<p>
List of events to be read as the command input.<br>
These events are processed first, before actual keyboard input.<br>
Events read from this list are not normally added to `this-command-keys',<br>
as they will already have been added once as they were read for the first time.<br>
An element of the form (t . EVENT) forces EVENT to be added to that list.</p>
