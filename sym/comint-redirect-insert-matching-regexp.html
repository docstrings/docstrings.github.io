<h3>Variable: comint-redirect-insert-matching-regexp</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, the text that ends a redirection is included in it.
More precisely, the text that matches `comint-redirect-finished-regexp'
and therefore terminates an output redirection is inserted in the
redirection target buffer, along with the preceding output.</p>
