<h3>Function: face-attribute-relative-p</h3>
<p>
Check whether a face attribute value is relative.<br>
Specifically, this function returns t if the attribute ATTRIBUTE<br>
with the value VALUE is relative.<br>
<br>
A relative value is one that doesn't entirely override whatever is<br>
inherited from another face.  For most possible attributes,<br>
the only relative value that users see is `unspecified'.<br>
However, for :height, floating point values are also relative.
