<h3>Function: face-attribute-relative-p</h3>
<p>
Check whether a face attribute value is relative.
Specifically, this function returns t if the attribute ATTRIBUTE
with the value VALUE is relative.</p>
<p>
A relative value is one that doesn't entirely override whatever is
inherited from another face.  For most possible attributes,
the only relative value that users see is `unspecified'.
However, for :height, floating point values are also relative.</p>
