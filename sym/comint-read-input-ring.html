<h3>Function: comint-read-input-ring</h3>
<p>
Set the buffer's `comint-input-ring' from a history file.
The name of the file is given by the variable `comint-input-ring-file-name'.
The history ring is of size `comint-input-ring-size', regardless of file size.
If `comint-input-ring-file-name' is nil this function does nothing.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument SILENT is non-nil, we say nothing about a
failure to read the history file.</p>
<p>
This function is useful for major mode commands and mode hooks.</p>
<p>
The commands stored in the history file are separated by the
`comint-input-ring-separator', and entries that match
`comint-input-history-ignore' are ignored.  The most recent command
comes last.</p>
<p>
See also `comint-input-ignoredups' and `comint-write-input-ring'.</p>
