<h3>Function: progress-reporter-update</h3>
<p>
Report progress of an operation in the echo area.
REPORTER should be the result of a call to `make-progress-reporter'.</p>
<p>
If REPORTER is a numerical progress reporter---i.e. if it was
 made using non-nil MIN-VALUE and MAX-VALUE arguments to
 `make-progress-reporter'---then VALUE should be a number between
 MIN-VALUE and MAX-VALUE.</p>
<p>
If REPORTER is a non-numerical reporter, VALUE should be nil.</p>
<p>
This function is relatively inexpensive.  If the change since
last update is too small or insufficient time has passed, it does
nothing.</p>
