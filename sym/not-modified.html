<h3>Function: not-modified</h3>
<p>
Mark current buffer as unmodified, not needing to be saved.
With prefix ARG, mark buffer as modified, so C-x C-s will save.</p>
<p>
It is not a good idea to use this function in Lisp programs, because it
prints a message in the minibuffer.  Instead, use `set-buffer-modified-p'.</p>
