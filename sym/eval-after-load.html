<h3>Function: eval-after-load</h3>
<p>
Arrange that if FILE is loaded, FORM will be run immediately afterwards.
If FILE is already loaded, evaluate FORM right now.</p>
<p>
If a matching file is loaded again, FORM will be evaluated again.</p>
<p>
If FILE is a string, it may be either an absolute or a relative file
name, and may have an extension (e.g. ".el") or may lack one, and
additionally may or may not have an extension denoting a compressed
format (e.g. ".gz").</p>
<p>
When FILE is absolute, this first converts it to a true name by chasing
symbolic links.  Only a file of this name (see next paragraph regarding
extensions) will trigger the evaluation of FORM.  When FILE is relative,
a file whose absolute true name ends in FILE will trigger evaluation.</p>
<p>
When FILE lacks an extension, a file name with any extension will trigger
evaluation.  Otherwise, its extension must match FILE's.  A further
extension for a compressed format (e.g. ".gz") on FILE will not affect
this name matching.</p>
<p>
Alternatively, FILE can be a feature (i.e. a symbol), in which case FORM
is evaluated at the end of any file that `provide's this feature.
If the feature is provided when evaluating code not associated with a
file, FORM is evaluated immediately after the provide statement.</p>
<p>
Usually FILE is just a library name like "font-lock" or a feature name
like 'font-lock.</p>
<p>
This function makes or adds to an entry on `after-load-alist'.</p>
