<h3>Variable: scroll-error-top-bottom</h3>
<p>
Move point to top/bottom of buffer before signaling a scrolling error.
A value of nil means just signal an error if no more scrolling possible.
A value of t means point moves to the beginning or the end of the buffer
(depending on scrolling direction) when no more scrolling possible.
When point is already on that position, then signal an error.</p>
