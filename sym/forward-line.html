<h3>Function: forward-line</h3>
<p>
Move N lines forward (backward if N is negative).<br>
Precisely, if point is on line I, move to the start of line I + N<br>
("start of line" in the logical order).<br>
If there isn't room, go as far as possible (no error).<br>
Returns the count of lines left to move.  If moving forward,<br>
that is N - number of lines moved; if backward, N + number moved.<br>
With positive N, a non-empty line at the end counts as one line<br>
successfully moved (for the return value).
