<h3>Face: cursor</h3>
<p>
Basic face for the cursor color under X.
Currently, only the `:background' attribute is meaningful; all
other attributes are ignored.  The cursor foreground color is
taken from the background color of the underlying text.</p>
<p>
Note: Other faces cannot inherit from the cursor face.</p>
