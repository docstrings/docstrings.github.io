<h3>Face: cursor</h3>
<p>
Basic face for the cursor color under X.<br>
Currently, only the `:background' attribute is meaningful; all<br>
other attributes are ignored.  The cursor foreground color is<br>
taken from the background color of the underlying text.<br>
<br>
Note: Other faces cannot inherit from the cursor face.</p>
