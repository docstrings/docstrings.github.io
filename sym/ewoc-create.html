<h3>Function: ewoc-create</h3>
<p>
Create an empty ewoc.</p>
<p>
The ewoc will be inserted in the current buffer at the current position.</p>
<p>
PRETTY-PRINTER should be a function that takes one argument, an
element, and inserts a string representing it in the buffer (at
point).  The string PRETTY-PRINTER inserts may be empty or span
several lines.  The PRETTY-PRINTER should use `insert', and not
`insert-before-markers'.</p>
<p>
Optional second and third arguments HEADER and FOOTER are strings,
possibly empty, that will always be present at the top and bottom,
respectively, of the ewoc.</p>
<p>
Normally, a newline is automatically inserted after the header,
the footer and every node's printed representation.  Optional
fourth arg NOSEP non-nil inhibits this.</p>
<p>
(fn PRETTY-PRINTER &optional HEADER FOOTER NOSEP)</p>
