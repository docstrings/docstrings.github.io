<h3>Variable: completion-extra-properties</h3>
<p>
Property list of extra properties of the current completion job.
These include:</p>
<p>
`:annotation-function': Function to annotate the completions buffer.
   The function must accept one argument, a completion string,
   and return either nil or a string which is to be displayed
   next to the completion (but which is not part of the
   completion).  The function can access the completion data via
   `minibuffer-completion-table' and related variables.</p>
<p>
`:exit-function': Function to run after completion is performed.</p>
<p>
   The function must accept two arguments, STRING and STATUS.
   STRING is the text to which the field was completed, and
   STATUS indicates what kind of operation happened:
     `finished' - text is now complete
     `sole'     - text cannot be further completed but
                  completion is not finished
     `exact'    - text is a valid completion but may be further
                  completed.</p>
