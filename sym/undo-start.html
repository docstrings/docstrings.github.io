<h3>Function: undo-start</h3>
<p>
Set `pending-undo-list' to the front of the undo list.
The next call to `undo-more' will undo the most recently made change.
If BEG and END are specified, then only undo elements
that apply to text between BEG and END are used; other undo elements
are ignored.  If BEG and END are nil, all undo elements are used.</p>
