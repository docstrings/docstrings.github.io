<h3>Function: array-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for editing arrays.</p>
<p>
  Array mode is a specialized mode for editing arrays.  An array is
considered to be a two-dimensional set of strings.  The strings are
NOT recognized as integers or real numbers.</p>
<p>
  The array MUST reside at the top of the buffer.</p>
<p>
  TABs are not respected, and may be converted into spaces at any time.
Setting the variable `array-respect-tabs' to non-nil will prevent TAB conversion,
but will cause many functions to give errors if they encounter one.</p>
<p>
  Upon entering array mode, you will be prompted for the values of
several variables.  Others will be calculated based on the values you
supply.  These variables are all local to the buffer.  Other buffer
in array mode may have different values assigned to the variables.
The variables are:</p>
<p>
Variables you assign:
     array-max-row:          The number of rows in the array.
     array-max-column:       The number of columns in the array.
     array-columns-per-line: The number of columns in the array per line of buffer.
     array-field-width:      The width of each field, in characters.
     array-rows-numbered:    A logical variable describing whether to ignore
                       row numbers in the buffer.</p>
<p>
Variables which are calculated:
     array-line-length:      The number of characters in a buffer line.
     array-lines-per-row:    The number of buffer lines used to display each row.</p>

    *   M-x array-copy-row-down   Copy the current row into the row below.
    *   M-x array-copy-row-up   Copy the current row into the row above.</p>
<p>
        M-x array-fill-rectangle   Copy the field at mark into every cell with row and column
                  between that of point and mark.</p>
<p>
	M-x array-what-position	  Display the current array row and column.
	M-x array-goto-cell	  Go to a particular array cell.</p>
<p>

        M-x array-expand-rows   Expand the array (remove row numbers and
                  newlines inside rows)</p>
<p>
        M-x array-display-local-variables   Display the current values of local variables.</p>
<p>
