<h3>Variable: undo-outer-limit-function</h3>
<p>
Function to call when an undo list exceeds `undo-outer-limit'.<br>
This function is called with one argument, the current undo list size<br>
for the most recent command (since the last undo boundary).<br>
If the function returns t, that means truncation has been fully handled.<br>
If it returns nil, the other forms of truncation are done.<br>
<br>
Garbage collection is inhibited around the call to this function,<br>
so it must make sure not to do a lot of consing.</p>
