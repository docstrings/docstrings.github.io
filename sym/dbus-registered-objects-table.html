<h3>Variable: dbus-registered-objects-table</h3>
<p>
Hash table of registered functions for D-Bus.</p>
<p>
There are two different uses of the hash table: for accessing
registered interfaces properties, targeted by signals or method calls,
and for calling handlers in case of non-blocking method call returns.</p>
<p>
In the first case, the key in the hash table is the list (TYPE BUS
INTERFACE MEMBER).  TYPE is one of the Lisp symbols `:method',
`:signal' or `:property'.  BUS is either a Lisp symbol, `:system' or
`:session', or a string denoting the bus address.  INTERFACE is a
string which denotes a D-Bus interface, and MEMBER, also a string, is
either a method, a signal or a property INTERFACE is offering.  All
arguments but BUS must not be nil.</p>
<p>
The value in the hash table is a list of quadruple lists ((UNAME
SERVICE PATH OBJECT [RULE]) ...).  SERVICE is the service name as
registered, UNAME is the corresponding unique name.  In case of
registered methods and properties, UNAME is nil.  PATH is the object
path of the sending object.  All of them can be nil, which means a
wildcard then.  OBJECT is either the handler to be called when a D-Bus
message, which matches the key criteria, arrives (TYPE `:method' and
`:signal'), or a cons cell containing the value of the property (TYPE
`:property').</p>
<p>
For entries of type `:signal', there is also a fifth element RULE,
which keeps the match string the signal is registered with.</p>
<p>
In the second case, the key in the hash table is the list (:serial BUS
SERIAL).  BUS is either a Lisp symbol, `:system' or `:session', or a
string denoting the bus address.  SERIAL is the serial number of the
non-blocking method call, a reply is expected.  Both arguments must
not be nil.  The value in the hash table is HANDLER, the function to
be called when the D-Bus reply message arrives.</p>
