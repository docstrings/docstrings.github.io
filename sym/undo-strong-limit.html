<h3>Variable: undo-strong-limit</h3>
<p>
Don't keep more than this much size of undo information.
This limit is applied when garbage collection happens.
When a previous command increases the total undo list size past this
value, that command and the earlier commands that came before it are forgotten.
However, the most recent buffer-modifying command's undo info
is never discarded for this reason.</p>
<p>
The size is counted as the number of bytes occupied,
which includes both saved text and other data.</p>
