<h3>Function: shell-quote-wildcard-pattern</h3>
<p>
Quote characters special to the shell in PATTERN, leave wildcards alone.</p>
<p>
PATTERN is assumed to represent a file-name wildcard suitable for the
underlying filesystem.  For Unix and GNU/Linux, each character from the
set [ \t\n;<>&|()'"#$] is quoted with a backslash; for DOS/Windows, all
the parts of the pattern which don't include wildcard characters are
quoted with double quotes.</p>
<p>
This function leaves alone existing quote characters (\ on Unix and "
on Windows), so PATTERN can use them to quote wildcard characters that
need to be passed verbatim to shell commands.</p>
