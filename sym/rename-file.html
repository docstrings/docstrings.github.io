<h3>Function: rename-file</h3>
<p>
Rename FILE as NEWNAME.  Both args must be strings.
If file has names other than FILE, it continues to have those names.
Signals a `file-already-exists' error if a file NEWNAME already exists
unless optional third argument OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS is non-nil.
A number as third arg means request confirmation if NEWNAME already exists.
This is what happens in interactive use with M-x.</p>
<p>
(fn FILE NEWNAME &optional OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS)</p>
