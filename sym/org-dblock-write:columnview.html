<h3>Function: org-dblock-write:columnview</h3>
<p>
Write the column view table.
PARAMS is a property list of parameters:</p>
<p>
:width    enforce same column widths with <N> specifiers.
:id       the :ID: property of the entry where the columns view
	  should be built.  When the symbol `local', call locally.
	  When `global' call column view with the cursor at the beginning
	  of the buffer (usually this means that the whole buffer switches
	  to column view).  When "file:path/to/file.org", invoke column
	  view at the start of that file.  Otherwise, the ID is located
	  using `org-id-find'.
:hlines   When t, insert a hline before each item.  When a number, insert
	  a hline before each level <= that number.
:vlines   When t, make each column a colgroup to enforce vertical lines.
:maxlevel When set to a number, don't capture headlines below this level.
:skip-empty-rows
	  When t, skip rows where all specifiers other than ITEM are empty.
:format   When non-nil, specify the column view format to use.</p>
