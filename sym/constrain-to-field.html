<h3>Function: constrain-to-field</h3>
<p>
Return the position closest to NEW-POS that is in the same field as OLD-POS.
A field is a region of text with the same `field' property.</p>
<p>
If NEW-POS is nil, then use the current point instead, and move point
to the resulting constrained position, in addition to returning that
position.</p>
<p>
If OLD-POS is at the boundary of two fields, then the allowable
positions for NEW-POS depends on the value of the optional argument
ESCAPE-FROM-EDGE: If ESCAPE-FROM-EDGE is nil, then NEW-POS is
constrained to the field that has the same `field' char-property
as any new characters inserted at OLD-POS, whereas if ESCAPE-FROM-EDGE
is non-nil, NEW-POS is constrained to the union of the two adjacent
fields.  Additionally, if two fields are separated by another field with
the special value `boundary', then any point within this special field is
also considered to be `on the boundary'.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument ONLY-IN-LINE is non-nil and constraining
NEW-POS would move it to a different line, NEW-POS is returned
unconstrained.  This useful for commands that move by line, like
C-n or M-x beginning-of-line, which should generally respect field boundaries
only in the case where they can still move to the right line.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument INHIBIT-CAPTURE-PROPERTY is non-nil, and OLD-POS has
a non-nil property of that name, then any field boundaries are ignored.</p>
<p>
Field boundaries are not noticed if `inhibit-field-text-motion' is non-nil.</p>
