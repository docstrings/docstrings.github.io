<h3>Function: unload-feature</h3>
<p>
Unload the library that provided FEATURE.
If the feature is required by any other loaded code, and prefix arg FORCE
is nil, raise an error.</p>
<p>
Standard unloading activities include restoring old autoloads for
functions defined by the library, undoing any additions that the
library has made to hook variables or to `auto-mode-alist', undoing
ELP profiling of functions in that library, unproviding any features
provided by the library, and canceling timers held in variables
defined by the library.</p>
<p>
If a function `FEATURE-unload-function' is defined, this function
calls it with no arguments, before doing anything else.  That function
can do whatever is appropriate to undo the loading of the library.  If
`FEATURE-unload-function' returns non-nil, that suppresses the
standard unloading of the library.  Otherwise the standard unloading
proceeds.</p>
<p>
`FEATURE-unload-function' has access to the package's list of
definitions in the variable `unload-function-defs-list' and could
remove symbols from it in the event that the package has done
something strange, such as redefining an Emacs function.</p>
