<h3>Function: log-edit</h3>
<p>
Setup a buffer to enter a log message.
The buffer is put in mode MODE or `log-edit-mode' if MODE is nil.</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `log-edit-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
If SETUP is non-nil, erase the buffer and run `log-edit-hook'.
Set mark and point around the entire contents of the buffer, so
that it is easy to kill the contents of the buffer with
C-w.  Once the user is done editing the message,
invoking the command M-x log-edit-done (`log-edit-done') will
call CALLBACK to do the actual commit.</p>
<p>
PARAMS if non-nil is an alist of variables and buffer-local
values to give them in the Log Edit buffer.  Possible keys and
associated values:
 `log-edit-listfun' -- function taking no arguments that returns the list of
 files that are concerned by the current operation (using relative names);
 `log-edit-diff-function' -- function taking no arguments that
 displays a diff of the files concerned by the current operation.
 `vc-log-fileset' -- the VC fileset to be committed (if any).</p>
<p>
If BUFFER is non-nil `log-edit' will jump to that buffer, use it
to edit the log message and go back to the current buffer when
done.  Otherwise, it uses the current buffer.</p>
