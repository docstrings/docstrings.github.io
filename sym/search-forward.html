<h3>Function: search-forward</h3>
<p>
Search forward from point for STRING.<br>
Set point to the end of the occurrence found, and return point.<br>
An optional second argument bounds the search; it is a buffer position.<br>
The match found must not extend after that position.  A value of nil is<br>
  equivalent to (point-max).<br>
Optional third argument, if t, means if fail just return nil (no error).<br>
  If not nil and not t, move to limit of search and return nil.<br>
Optional fourth argument COUNT, if non-nil, means to search for COUNT<br>
 successive occurrences.  If COUNT is negative, search backward,<br>
 instead of forward, for -COUNT occurrences.<br>
<br>
Search case-sensitivity is determined by the value of the variable<br>
`case-fold-search', which see.<br>
<br>
See also the functions `match-beginning', `match-end' and `replace-match'.
