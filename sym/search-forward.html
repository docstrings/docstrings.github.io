<h3>Function: search-forward</h3>
<p>
Search forward from point for STRING.
Set point to the end of the occurrence found, and return point.
An optional second argument bounds the search; it is a buffer position.
The match found must not extend after that position.  A value of nil is
  equivalent to (point-max).
Optional third argument, if t, means if fail just return nil (no error).
  If not nil and not t, move to limit of search and return nil.
Optional fourth argument COUNT, if non-nil, means to search for COUNT
 successive occurrences.  If COUNT is negative, search backward,
 instead of forward, for -COUNT occurrences.</p>
<p>
Search case-sensitivity is determined by the value of the variable
`case-fold-search', which see.</p>
