<h3>Function: electric-buffer-list</h3>
<p>
Pop up the Buffer Menu in an "electric" window.
If you type SPC or RET (`Electric-buffer-menu-select'), that
selects the buffer at point and quits the "electric" window.
Otherwise, you can move around in the Buffer Menu, marking
buffers to be selected, saved or deleted; these other commands
are much like those of `Buffer-menu-mode'.</p>
<p>
Run hooks in `electric-buffer-menu-mode-hook' on entry.</p>
<p>

Uses keymap `electric-buffer-menu-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>

  configuration.  If the very first character typed is a space, it

  Also show buffers marked with m in other windows,
