<h3>Function: electric-buffer-list</h3>
<p>
Pop up the Buffer Menu in an "electric" window.<br>
If you type SPC or RET (`Electric-buffer-menu-select'), that<br>
selects the buffer at point and quits the "electric" window.<br>
Otherwise, you can move around in the Buffer Menu, marking<br>
buffers to be selected, saved or deleted; these other commands<br>
are much like those of `Buffer-menu-mode'.<br>
<br>
Run hooks in `electric-buffer-menu-mode-hook' on entry.<br>
<br>
<br>
Uses keymap `electric-buffer-menu-mode-map', which is not currently defined.<br>
<br>
C-g or M-x Electric-buffer-menu-quit -- exit buffer menu, returning to previous window and buffer<br>
  configuration.  If the very first character typed is a space, it<br>
  also has this effect.<br>
M-x Electric-buffer-menu-select -- select buffer of line point is on.<br>
  Also show buffers marked with m in other windows,<br>
  deletes buffers marked with "D", and saves those marked with "S".<br>
M-x Buffer-menu-mark -- mark buffer to be displayed.<br>
M-x Buffer-menu-not-modified -- clear modified-flag on that buffer.<br>
M-x Buffer-menu-save -- mark that buffer to be saved.<br>
M-x Buffer-menu-delete or M-x Buffer-menu-delete-backwards -- mark that buffer to be deleted.<br>
M-x Buffer-menu-unmark -- remove all kinds of marks from current line.<br>
M-x Electric-buffer-menu-mode-view-buffer -- view buffer, returning when done.
M-x Buffer-menu-backup-unmark -- back up a line and remove marks.
