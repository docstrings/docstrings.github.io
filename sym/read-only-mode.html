<h3>Function: read-only-mode</h3>
<p>
Change whether the current buffer is read-only.<br>
With prefix argument ARG, make the buffer read-only if ARG is<br>
positive, otherwise make it writable.  If buffer is read-only<br>
and `view-read-only' is non-nil, enter view mode.<br>
<br>
Do not call this from a Lisp program unless you really intend to<br>
do the same thing as the C-x C-q command, including<br>
possibly enabling or disabling View mode.  Also, note that this<br>
command works by setting the variable `buffer-read-only', which<br>
does not affect read-only regions caused by text properties.  To<br>
ignore read-only status in a Lisp program (whether due to text<br>
properties or buffer state), bind `inhibit-read-only' temporarily
to a non-nil value.</p>
