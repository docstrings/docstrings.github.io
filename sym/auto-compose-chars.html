<h3>Function: auto-compose-chars</h3>
<p>
Compose the characters at FROM by FUNC.
FUNC is called with one argument GSTRING which is built for characters
in the region FROM (inclusive) and TO (exclusive).</p>
<p>
If the character are composed on a graphic display, FONT-OBJECT
is a font to use.  Otherwise, FONT-OBJECT is nil, and the function
`compose-gstring-for-terminal' is used instead of FUNC.</p>
<p>
If STRING is non-nil, it is a string, and FROM and TO are indices
into the string.  In that case, compose characters in the string.</p>
<p>
The value is a gstring containing information for shaping the characters.</p>
<p>
This function is the default value of `auto-composition-function' (which see).</p>
