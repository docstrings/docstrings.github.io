<h3>Function: ebnf-eps-region</h3>
<p>
Generate a PostScript syntactic chart image of the region in an EPS file.</p>
<p>
Generate an EPS file for each production in the region.
The EPS file name has the following form:</p>
<p>
   <PREFIX><PRODUCTION>.eps</p>
<p>
<PREFIX>     is given by variable `ebnf-eps-prefix'.
	     The default value is "ebnf--".</p>
<p>
<PRODUCTION> is the production name.
	     Some characters in the production file name are replaced to
	     produce a valid file name.  For example, the production name
	     "A/B + C" is modified to produce "A_B_+_C", and the EPS
	     file name used in this case will be "ebnf--A_B_+_C.eps".</p>
<p>
WARNING: This function does *NOT* ask any confirmation to override existing
	 files.</p>
