<h3>Function: completion-table-with-terminator</h3>
<p>
Construct a completion table like TABLE but with an extra TERMINATOR.
This is meant to be called in a curried way by first passing TERMINATOR
and TABLE only (via `apply-partially').
TABLE is a completion table, and TERMINATOR is a string appended to TABLE's
completion if it is complete.  TERMINATOR is also used to determine the
completion suffix's boundary.
TERMINATOR can also be a cons cell (TERMINATOR . TERMINATOR-REGEXP)
in which case TERMINATOR-REGEXP is a regular expression whose submatch
number 1 should match TERMINATOR.  This is used when there is a need to
distinguish occurrences of the TERMINATOR strings which are really terminators
from others (e.g. escaped).  In this form, the car of TERMINATOR can also be,
instead of a string, a function that takes the completion and returns the
"terminated" string.</p>
