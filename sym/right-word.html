<h3>Function: right-word</h3>
<p>
Move point N words to the right (to the left if N is negative).</p>
<p>
Depending on the bidirectional context, this may move either forward
or backward in the buffer.  This is in contrast with M-f
and M-b, which see.</p>
<p>
Value is normally t.
If an edge of the buffer or a field boundary is reached, point is left there
there and the function returns nil.  Field boundaries are not noticed
if `inhibit-field-text-motion' is non-nil.</p>
