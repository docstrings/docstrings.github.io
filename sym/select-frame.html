<h3>Function: select-frame</h3>
<p>
Select FRAME.
Subsequent editing commands apply to its selected window.
Optional argument NORECORD means to neither change the order of
recently selected windows nor the buffer list.</p>
<p>
The selection of FRAME lasts until the next time the user does
something to select a different frame, or until the next time
this function is called.  If you are using a window system, the
previously selected frame may be restored as the selected frame
when returning to the command loop, because it still may have
the window system's input focus.  On a text terminal, the next
redisplay will display FRAME.</p>
<p>
This function returns FRAME, or nil if FRAME has been deleted.</p>
