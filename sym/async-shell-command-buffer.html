<h3>Variable: async-shell-command-buffer</h3>
<p>
What to do when the output buffer is used by another shell command.
This option specifies how to resolve the conflict where a new command
wants to direct its output to the buffer `*Async Shell Command*',
but this buffer is already taken by another running shell command.</p>
<p>
The value `confirm-kill-process' is used to ask for confirmation before
killing the already running process and running a new process
in the same buffer, `confirm-new-buffer' for confirmation before running
the command in a new buffer with a name other than the default buffer name,
`new-buffer' for doing the same without confirmation,
`confirm-rename-buffer' for confirmation before renaming the existing
output buffer and running a new command in the default buffer,
`rename-buffer' for doing the same without confirmation.</p>
