<h3>Function: disassemble</h3>
<p>
Print disassembled code for OBJECT in (optional) BUFFER.
OBJECT can be a symbol defined as a function, or a function itself
(a lambda expression or a compiled-function object).
If OBJECT is not already compiled, we compile it, but do not
redefine OBJECT if it is a symbol.</p>
