<h3>Function: other-buffer</h3>
<p>
Return most recently selected buffer other than BUFFER.
Buffers not visible in windows are preferred to visible buffers, unless
optional second argument VISIBLE-OK is non-nil.  Ignore the argument
BUFFER unless it denotes a live buffer.  If the optional third argument
FRAME is non-nil, use that frame's buffer list instead of the selected
frame's buffer list.</p>
<p>
The buffer is found by scanning the selected or specified frame's buffer
list first, followed by the list of all buffers.  If no other buffer
exists, return the buffer `*scratch*' (creating it if necessary).</p>
