<h3>Variable: tex-alt-dvi-print-command</h3>
<p>
Command used by M-x tex-print with a prefix arg to print a .dvi file.
If this string contains an asterisk (`*'), that is replaced by the file name;
otherwise, the file name, preceded by blank, is added at the end.</p>
<p>
If two printers are not enough of a choice, you can set the variable
`tex-alt-dvi-print-command' to an expression that asks what you want;
for example,</p>
<p>
    (setq tex-alt-dvi-print-command
         '(format "lpr -P%s" (read-string "Use printer: ")))</p>
<p>
would tell M-x tex-print with a prefix argument to ask you which printer to
use.</p>
