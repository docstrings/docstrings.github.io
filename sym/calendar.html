<h3>Function: calendar</h3>
<p>
Display a three-month Gregorian calendar.
The three months appear side by side, with the current month in
the middle surrounded by the previous and next months.  The
cursor is put on today's date.  If optional prefix argument ARG
is non-nil, prompts for the central month and year.</p>
<p>
Once in the calendar window, future or past months can be moved
into view.  Arbitrary months can be displayed, or the calendar
can be scrolled forward or backward.  The cursor can be moved
forward or backward by one day, one week, one month, or one year.
All of these commands take prefix arguments which, when negative,
cause movement in the opposite direction.  For convenience, the
digit keys and the minus sign are automatically prefixes.  Use
C-h m for details of the key bindings in the calendar
window.</p>
<p>
Displays the calendar in a separate window, or optionally in a
separate frame, depending on the value of `calendar-setup'.</p>
<p>
If `calendar-view-diary-initially-flag' is non-nil, also displays the
diary entries for the current date (or however many days
`diary-number-of-entries' specifies).  This variable can be
overridden by `calendar-setup'.  As well as being displayed,
diary entries can also be marked on the calendar (see
`calendar-mark-diary-entries-flag').</p>
<p>
Runs the following hooks:</p>
<p>
`calendar-load-hook' - after loading calendar.el
`calendar-today-visible-hook', `calendar-today-invisible-hook' - after
   generating a calendar, if today's date is visible or not, respectively
`calendar-initial-window-hook' - after first creating a calendar</p>
<p>
This function is suitable for execution in an init file.</p>
