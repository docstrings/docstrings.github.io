<h3>Function: line-beginning-position</h3>
<p>
Return the character position of the first character on the current line.
With optional argument N, scan forward N - 1 lines first.
If the scan reaches the end of the buffer, return that position.</p>
<p>
This function ignores text display directionality; it returns the
position of the first character in logical order, i.e. the smallest
character position on the line.</p>
<p>
This function constrains the returned position to the current field
unless that position would be on a different line than the original,
unconstrained result.  If N is nil or 1, and a front-sticky field
starts at point, the scan stops as soon as it starts.  To ignore field
boundaries, bind `inhibit-field-text-motion' to t.</p>
<p>
This function does not move point.</p>
