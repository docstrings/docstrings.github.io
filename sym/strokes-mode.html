Strokes are pictographic mouse gestures which invoke commands.
Strokes are invoked with M-x strokes-do-stroke.  You can define
new strokes with M-x strokes-global-set-stroke.  See also
M-x strokes-do-complex-stroke for `complex' strokes.</p>
<p>
To use strokes for pictographic editing, such as Chinese/Japanese, use
M-x strokes-compose-complex-stroke, which draws strokes and inserts them.
Encode/decode your strokes with M-x strokes-encode-buffer,
M-x strokes-decode-buffer.</p>

<h3>Variable: strokes-mode</h3>
<p>
Non-nil if Strokes mode is enabled.
See the command `strokes-mode' for a description of this minor mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')
or call the function `strokes-mode'.</p>
