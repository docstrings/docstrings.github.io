<h3>Function: byte-compile-output-docform</h3>
<p>
Print a form with a doc string.  INFO is (prefix doc-index postfix).<br>
If PREFACE and NAME are non-nil, print them too,<br>
before INFO and the FORM but after the doc string itself.<br>
If SPECINDEX is non-nil, it is the index in FORM<br>
of the function bytecode string.  In that case,<br>
we output that argument and the following argument<br>
(the constants vector) together, for lazy loading.<br>
QUOTED says that we have to put a quote before the<br>
list that represents a doc string reference.<br>
`defvaralias', `autoload' and `custom-declare-variable' need that.<br>
<br>
(fn PREFACE NAME INFO FORM SPECINDEX QUOTED)</p>
