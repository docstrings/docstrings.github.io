<h3>Function: mark</h3>
<p>
Return this buffer's mark value as integer, or nil if never set.</p>
<p>
In Transient Mark mode, this function signals an error if
the mark is not active.  However, if `mark-even-if-inactive' is non-nil,
or the argument FORCE is non-nil, it disregards whether the mark
is active, and returns an integer or nil in the usual way.</p>
<p>
If you are using this in an editing command, you are most likely making
a mistake; see the documentation of `set-mark'.</p>
