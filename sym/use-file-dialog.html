<h3>Variable: use-file-dialog</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means mouse commands use a file dialog to ask for files.<br>
This applies to commands from menus and tool bar buttons even when<br>
they are initiated from the keyboard.  If `use-dialog-box' is nil,<br>
that disables the use of a file dialog, regardless of the value of<br>
this variable.</p>
