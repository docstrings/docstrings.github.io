<h3>Variable: blink-cursor-alist</h3>
<p>
Alist specifying how to blink the cursor off.
Each element has the form (ON-STATE . OFF-STATE).  Whenever the
`cursor-type' frame-parameter or variable equals ON-STATE,
comparing using `equal', Emacs uses OFF-STATE to specify
how to blink it off.  ON-STATE and OFF-STATE are values for
the `cursor-type' frame parameter.</p>
<p>
If a frame's ON-STATE has no entry in this list,
the frame's other specifications determine how to blink the cursor off.</p>
