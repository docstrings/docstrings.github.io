<h3>Variable: char-property-alias-alist</h3>
<p>
Alist of alternative properties for properties without a value.
Each element should look like (PROPERTY ALTERNATIVE1 ALTERNATIVE2...).
If a piece of text has no direct value for a particular property, then
this alist is consulted.  If that property appears in the alist, then
the first non-nil value from the associated alternative properties is
returned.</p>
