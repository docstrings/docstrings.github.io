<h3>Variable: scroll-up-aggressively</h3>
<p>
How far to scroll windows upward.<br>
If you move point off the bottom, the window scrolls automatically.<br>
This variable controls how far it scrolls.  The value nil, the default,<br>
means scroll to center point.  A fraction means scroll to put point<br>
that fraction of the window's height from the bottom of the window.<br>
When the value is 0.0, point goes at the bottom line, which in the<br>
simple case that you moved off with C-f means scrolling just one line.<br>
1.0 means point goes at the top, so that in that simple case, the<br>
window scrolls by a full window height.  Meaningful values are
between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.</p>
