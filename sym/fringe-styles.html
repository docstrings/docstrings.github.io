<h3>Variable: fringe-styles</h3>
<p>
Alist mapping fringe mode names to fringe widths.
Each list element has the form (NAME . WIDTH), where NAME is a
mnemonic fringe mode name (a symbol) and WIDTH is one of the
following:
- nil, which means the default width (8 pixels).
- a cons cell (LEFT . RIGHT), where LEFT and RIGHT are
  respectively the left and right fringe widths in pixels, or
  nil (meaning to disable that fringe).
- a single integer, which specifies the pixel widths of both
  fringes.</p>
