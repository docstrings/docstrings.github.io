<h3>Function: vc-create-tag</h3>
<p>
Descending recursively from DIR, make a tag called NAME.
For each registered file, the working revision becomes part of
the named configuration.  If the prefix argument BRANCHP is
given, the tag is made as a new branch and the files are
checked out in that new branch.</p>
