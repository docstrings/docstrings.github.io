<h3>Variable: filter-buffer-substring-functions</h3>
<p>
This variable is a wrapper hook around `filter-buffer-substring'.
Each member of the hook should be a function accepting four arguments:
(FUN BEG END DELETE), where FUN is itself a function of three arguments
(BEG END DELETE).  The arguments BEG, END, and DELETE are the same
as those of `filter-buffer-substring' in each case.</p>
<p>
The first hook function to be called receives a FUN equivalent
to the default operation of `filter-buffer-substring',
i.e. one that returns the buffer-substring between BEG and
END (processed by any `buffer-substring-filters').  Normally,
the hook function will call FUN and then do its own processing
of the result.  The next hook function receives a FUN equivalent
to the previous hook function, calls it, and does its own
processing, and so on.  The overall result is that of all hook
functions acting in sequence.</p>
<p>
Any hook may choose not to call FUN though, in which case it
effectively replaces the default behavior with whatever it chooses.
Of course, a later hook function may do the same thing.</p>
