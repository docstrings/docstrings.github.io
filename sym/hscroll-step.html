<h3>Variable: hscroll-step</h3>
<p>
How many columns to scroll the window when point gets too close to the edge.<br>
When point is less than `hscroll-margin' columns from the window<br>
edge, automatic hscrolling will scroll the window by the amount of columns<br>
determined by this variable.  If its value is a positive integer, scroll that<br>
many columns.  If it's a positive floating-point number, it specifies the<br>
fraction of the window's width to scroll.  If it's nil or zero, point will be<br>
centered horizontally after the scroll.  Any other value, including negative<br>
numbers, are treated as if the value were zero.<br>
<br>
Automatic hscrolling always moves point outside the scroll margin, so if<br>
point was more than scroll step columns inside the margin, the window will<br>
scroll more than the value given by the scroll step.<br>
<br>
Note that the lower bound for automatic hscrolling specified by `scroll-left'<br>
and `scroll-right' overrides this variable's effect.</p>
