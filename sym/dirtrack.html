<h3>Function: dirtrack</h3>
<p>
Determine the current directory from the process output for a prompt.<br>
This filter function is used by `dirtrack-mode'.  It looks for<br>
the prompt specified by `dirtrack-list', and calls<br>
`shell-process-cd' if the directory seems to have changed away<br>
from `default-directory'.
