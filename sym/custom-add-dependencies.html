<h3>Function: custom-add-dependencies</h3>
<p>
To the custom option SYMBOL, add dependencies specified by VALUE.
VALUE should be a list of symbols.  For each symbol in that list,
this specifies that SYMBOL should be set after the specified symbol, if
both appear in constructs like `custom-set-variables'.</p>
