<h3>Variable: coding-category-list</h3>
<p>
List of coding-categories (symbols) ordered by priority.<br>
<br>
On detecting a coding system, Emacs tries code detection algorithms<br>
associated with each coding-category one by one in this order.  When<br>
one algorithm agrees with a byte sequence of source text, the coding<br>
system bound to the corresponding coding-category is selected.<br>
<br>
Don't modify this variable directly, but use `set-coding-system-priority'.</p>
