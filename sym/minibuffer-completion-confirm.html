<h3>Variable: minibuffer-completion-confirm</h3>
<p>
Whether to demand confirmation of completion before exiting minibuffer.<br>
If nil, confirmation is not required.<br>
If the value is `confirm', the user may exit with an input that is not<br>
 a valid completion alternative, but Emacs asks for confirmation.<br>
If the value is `confirm-after-completion', the user may exit with an<br>
 input that is not a valid completion alternative, but Emacs asks for<br>
 confirmation if the user submitted the input right after any of the<br>
 completion commands listed in `minibuffer-confirm-exit-commands'.</p>
