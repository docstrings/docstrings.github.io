<h3>Function: find-file-literally</h3>
<p>
Visit file FILENAME with no conversion of any kind.
Format conversion and character code conversion are both disabled,
and multibyte characters are disabled in the resulting buffer.
The major mode used is Fundamental mode regardless of the file name,
and local variable specifications in the file are ignored.
Automatic uncompression and adding a newline at the end of the
file due to `require-final-newline' is also disabled.</p>
<p>
You cannot absolutely rely on this function to result in
visiting the file literally.  If Emacs already has a buffer
which is visiting the file, you get the existing buffer,
regardless of whether it was created literally or not.</p>
<p>
In a Lisp program, if you want to be sure of accessing a file's
contents literally, you should create a temporary buffer and then read
the file contents into it using `insert-file-contents-literally'.</p>
<h3>Variable: find-file-literally</h3>
<p>
Non-nil if this buffer was made by `find-file-literally' or equivalent.
This has the `permanent-local' property, which takes effect if you
make the variable buffer-local.</p>
