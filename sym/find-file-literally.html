<h3>Function: find-file-literally</h3>
<p>
Visit file FILENAME with no conversion of any kind.<br>
Format conversion and character code conversion are both disabled,<br>
and multibyte characters are disabled in the resulting buffer.<br>
The major mode used is Fundamental mode regardless of the file name,<br>
and local variable specifications in the file are ignored.<br>
Automatic uncompression and adding a newline at the end of the<br>
file due to `require-final-newline' is also disabled.<br>
<br>
You cannot absolutely rely on this function to result in<br>
visiting the file literally.  If Emacs already has a buffer<br>
which is visiting the file, you get the existing buffer,<br>
regardless of whether it was created literally or not.<br>
<br>
In a Lisp program, if you want to be sure of accessing a file's<br>
contents literally, you should create a temporary buffer and then read<br>
the file contents into it using `insert-file-contents-literally'.</p>
<h3>Variable: find-file-literally</h3>
<p>
Non-nil if this buffer was made by `find-file-literally' or equivalent.<br>
This has the `permanent-local' property, which takes effect if you<br>
make the variable buffer-local.</p>
