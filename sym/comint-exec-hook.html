<h3>Variable: comint-exec-hook</h3>
<p>
Hook run each time a process is exec'd by `comint-exec'.
This is called after the process is cranked up.  It is useful for things that
must be done each time a process is executed in a Comint mode buffer (e.g.,
`(process-kill-without-query)').  In contrast, the `comint-mode-hook' is only
executed once when the buffer is created.</p>
