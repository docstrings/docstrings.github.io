<h3>Function: recursive-edit</h3>
<p>
Invoke the editor command loop recursively.
To get out of the recursive edit, a command can do `(throw 'exit nil)';
that tells this function to return.
Alternatively, `(throw 'exit t)' makes this function signal an error.
This function is called by the editor initialization to begin editing.</p>
