<h3>Function: scroll-down-command</h3>
<p>
Scroll text of selected window down ARG lines; or near full screen if no ARG.
If `scroll-error-top-bottom' is non-nil and `scroll-down' cannot
scroll window further, move cursor to the top line.
When point is already on that position, then signal an error.
A near full screen is `next-screen-context-lines' less than a full screen.
Negative ARG means scroll upward.
If ARG is the atom `-', scroll upward by nearly full screen.</p>
