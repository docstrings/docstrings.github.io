<h3>Function: scroll-down-command</h3>
<p>
Scroll text of selected window down ARG lines; or near full screen if no ARG.<br>
If `scroll-error-top-bottom' is non-nil and `scroll-down' cannot<br>
scroll window further, move cursor to the top line.<br>
When point is already on that position, then signal an error.<br>
A near full screen is `next-screen-context-lines' less than a full screen.<br>
Negative ARG means scroll upward.<br>
If ARG is the atom `-', scroll upward by nearly full screen.</p>
