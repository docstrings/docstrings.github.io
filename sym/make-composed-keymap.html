<h3>Function: make-composed-keymap</h3>
<p>
Construct a new keymap composed of MAPS and inheriting from PARENT.<br>
When looking up a key in the returned map, the key is looked in each<br>
keymap of MAPS in turn until a binding is found.<br>
If no binding is found in MAPS, the lookup continues in PARENT, if non-nil.<br>
As always with keymap inheritance, a nil binding in MAPS overrides<br>
any corresponding binding in PARENT, but it does not override corresponding<br>
bindings in other keymaps of MAPS.<br>
MAPS can be a list of keymaps or a single keymap.<br>
PARENT if non-nil should be a keymap.</p>
