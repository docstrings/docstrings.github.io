<h3>Variable: sh-indent-after-loop-construct</h3>
<p>
How much to indent a statement after a loop construct.<br>
<br>
This variable is used when the keyword `do' is on the same line as the<br>
loop statement (e.g., `until', `while' or `for').<br>
If the `do' is on a line by itself, then `sh-indent-after-do' is used instead.</p>
