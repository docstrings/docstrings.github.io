<h3>Function: make-local-variable</h3>
<p>
Make VARIABLE have a separate value in the current buffer.
Other buffers will continue to share a common default value.
(The buffer-local value of VARIABLE starts out as the same value
VARIABLE previously had.  If VARIABLE was void, it remains void.)
Return VARIABLE.</p>
<p>
If the variable is already arranged to become local when set,
this function causes a local value to exist for this buffer,
just as setting the variable would do.</p>
<p>
This function returns VARIABLE, and therefore
  (set (make-local-variable 'VARIABLE) VALUE-EXP)
works.</p>
<p>
See also `make-variable-buffer-local'.</p>
<p>
Do not use `make-local-variable' to make a hook variable buffer-local.
Instead, use `add-hook' and specify t for the LOCAL argument.</p>
<p>
(fn VARIABLE)</p>
