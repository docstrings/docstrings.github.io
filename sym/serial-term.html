<h3>Function: serial-term</h3>
<p>
Start a terminal-emulator for a serial port in a new buffer.
PORT is the path or name of the serial port.  For example, this
could be "/dev/ttyS0" on Unix.  On Windows, this could be
"COM1" or "\\.\COM10".
SPEED is the speed of the serial port in bits per second.  9600
is a common value.  SPEED can be nil, see
`serial-process-configure' for details.
The buffer is in Term mode; see `term-mode' for the commands to
use in that buffer.</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `term-raw-map', which is not currently defined.
Type C-x b to switch to another buffer.</p>
