<h3>Function: serial-term</h3>
<p>
Start a terminal-emulator for a serial port in a new buffer.<br>
PORT is the path or name of the serial port.  For example, this<br>
could be "/dev/ttyS0" on Unix.  On Windows, this could be<br>
"COM1" or "\\.\COM10".<br>
SPEED is the speed of the serial port in bits per second.  9600<br>
is a common value.  SPEED can be nil, see<br>
`serial-process-configure' for details.<br>
The buffer is in Term mode; see `term-mode' for the commands to<br>
use in that buffer.<br>
<br>
Uses keymap `term-raw-map', which is not currently defined.<br>
Type C-x b to switch to another buffer.
