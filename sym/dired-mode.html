<h3>Function: dired-mode</h3>
<p>
Mode for "editing" directory listings.<br>
In Dired, you are "editing" a list of the files in a directory and<br>
  (optionally) its subdirectories, in the format of `ls -lR'.<br>
  Each directory is a page: use C-x [ and C-x ] to move pagewise.<br>
"Editing" means that you can run shell commands on files, visit,<br>
  compress, load or byte-compile them, change their file attributes<br>
  and insert subdirectories into the same buffer.  You can "mark"<br>
  files for later commands or "flag" them for deletion, either file<br>
  by file or all files matching certain criteria.<br>
You can move using the usual cursor motion commands.<br>
Uses keymap `dired-mode-map', which is not currently defined.<br>
<br>
The buffer is read-only.  Digits are prefix arguments.<br>
Type M-x dired-flag-file-deletion to flag a file `D' for deletion.<br>
Type M-x dired-mark to Mark a file or subdirectory for later commands.<br>
  Most commands operate on the marked files and use the current file<br>
  if no files are marked.  Use a numeric prefix argument to operate on<br>
  the next ARG (or previous -ARG if ARG<0) files, or just `1'<br>
  to operate on the current file only.  Prefix arguments override marks.<br>
  Mark-using commands display a list of failures afterwards.  Type M-x dired-summary<br>
  to see why something went wrong.<br>
Type M-x dired-unmark to Unmark a file or all files of an inserted subdirectory.<br>
Type M-x dired-unmark-backward to back up one line and unmark or unflag.<br>
Type M-x dired-do-flagged-delete to delete (eXecute) the files flagged `D'.<br>
Type M-x dired-find-file to Find the current line's file<br>
  (or dired it in another buffer, if it is a directory).<br>
Type M-x dired-find-file-other-window to find file or dired directory in Other window.<br>
Type M-x dired-maybe-insert-subdir to Insert a subdirectory in this buffer.<br>
Type M-x dired-do-rename to Rename a file or move the marked files to another directory.<br>
Type M-x dired-do-copy to Copy files.<br>
Type M-x dired-sort-toggle-or-edit to toggle Sorting by name/date or change the `ls' switches.<br>
Type M-x revert-buffer to read all currently expanded directories aGain.<br>
  This retains all marks and hides subdirs again that were hidden before.<br>
Use `SPC' and `DEL' to move down and up by lines.<br>
<br>
If Dired ever gets confused, you can either type M-x revert-buffer to read the<br>
directories again, type M-x dired-do-redisplay to relist the file at point or the marked files or a<br>
subdirectory, or type M-x dired-build-subdir-alist to parse the buffer<br>
again for the directory tree.<br>
