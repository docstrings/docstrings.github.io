<h3>Function: what-cursor-position</h3>
<p>
Print info on cursor position (on screen and within buffer).<br>
Also describe the character after point, and give its character code<br>
in octal, decimal and hex.<br>
<br>
For a non-ASCII multibyte character, also give its encoding in the<br>
buffer's selected coding system if the coding system encodes the<br>
character safely.  If the character is encoded into one byte, that<br>
code is shown in hex.  If the character is encoded into more than one<br>
byte, just "..." is shown.<br>
<br>
In addition, with prefix argument, show details about that character<br>
in *Help* buffer.  See also the command `describe-char'.</p>
