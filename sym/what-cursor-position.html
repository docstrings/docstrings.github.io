<h3>Function: what-cursor-position</h3>
<p>
Print info on cursor position (on screen and within buffer).
Also describe the character after point, and give its character code
in octal, decimal and hex.</p>
<p>
For a non-ASCII multibyte character, also give its encoding in the
buffer's selected coding system if the coding system encodes the
character safely.  If the character is encoded into one byte, that
code is shown in hex.  If the character is encoded into more than one
byte, just "..." is shown.</p>
<p>
In addition, with prefix argument, show details about that character
in *Help* buffer.  See also the command `describe-char'.</p>
