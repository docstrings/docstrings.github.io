<h3>Function: find-lisp-object-file-name</h3>
<p>
Guess the file that defined the Lisp object OBJECT, of type TYPE.
OBJECT should be a symbol associated with a function, variable, or face;
  alternatively, it can be a function definition.
If TYPE is `defvar', search for a variable definition.
If TYPE is `defface', search for a face definition.
If TYPE is the value returned by `symbol-function' for a function symbol,
 search for a function definition.</p>
<p>
The return value is the absolute name of a readable file where OBJECT is
defined.  If several such files exist, preference is given to a file
found via `load-path'.  The return value can also be `C-source', which
means that OBJECT is a function or variable defined in C.  If no
suitable file is found, return nil.</p>
