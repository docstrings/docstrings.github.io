<h3>Function: table-recognize-cell</h3>
<p>
Recognize a table cell that contains current point.
Probe the cell dimension and prepare the cell information.  The
optional two arguments FORCE and NO-COPY are for internal use only and
must not be specified.  When the optional numeric prefix argument ARG
is negative the cell becomes inactive, meaning that the cell becomes
plain text and loses all the table specific features.</p>
