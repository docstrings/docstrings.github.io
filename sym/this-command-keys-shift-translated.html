<h3>Variable: this-command-keys-shift-translated</h3>
<p>
Non-nil if the key sequence activating this command was shift-translated.
Shift-translation occurs when there is no binding for the key sequence
as entered, but a binding was found by changing an upper-case letter
to lower-case, or a shifted function key to an unshifted one.</p>
