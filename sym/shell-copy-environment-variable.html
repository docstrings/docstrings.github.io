<h3>Function: shell-copy-environment-variable</h3>
<p>
Copy the environment variable VARIABLE from the subshell to Emacs.<br>
This command reads the value of the specified environment variable<br>
in the shell, and sets the same environment variable in Emacs<br>
(what `getenv' in Emacs would return) to that value.<br>
That value will affect any new subprocesses that you subsequently start<br>
from Emacs.
