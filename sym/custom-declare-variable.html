<h3>Function: custom-declare-variable</h3>
<p>
Like `defcustom', but SYMBOL and DEFAULT are evaluated as normal arguments.
DEFAULT should be an expression to evaluate to compute the default value,
not the default value itself.</p>
<p>
DEFAULT is stored as SYMBOL's standard value, in SYMBOL's property
`standard-value'.  At the same time, SYMBOL's property `force-value' is
set to nil, as the value is no longer rogue.</p>
