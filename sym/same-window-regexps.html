<h3>Variable: same-window-regexps</h3>
<p>
List of regexps saying which buffers should appear in the "same" window.
`display-buffer' and `pop-to-buffer' show a buffer whose name
matches a regexp on this list in the selected rather than some
other window.</p>
<p>
An element of this list can be a cons cell instead of just a
string.  In that case, the cell's car must be a regexp matching
the buffer name.  This is for compatibility with
`special-display-regexps'; the cdr of the cons cell is ignored.</p>
<p>
See also `same-window-buffer-names'.</p>
