<h3>Function: sql-help</h3>
<p>
Show short help for the SQL modes.</p>
<p>
Use an entry function to open an interactive SQL buffer.  This buffer is
usually named `*SQL*'.  The name of the major mode is SQLi.</p>
<p>
Use the following commands to start a specific SQL interpreter:</p>
<p>
    \\FREE</p>
<p>
Other non-free SQL implementations are also supported:</p>
<p>
    \\NONFREE</p>
<p>
But we urge you to choose a free implementation instead of these.</p>
<p>
You can also use M-x sql-product-interactive to invoke the
interpreter for the current `sql-product'.</p>
<p>
Once you have the SQLi buffer, you can enter SQL statements in the
buffer.  The output generated is appended to the buffer and a new prompt
is generated.  See the In/Out menu in the SQLi buffer for some functions
that help you navigate through the buffer, the input history, etc.</p>
<p>
If you have a really complex SQL statement or if you are writing a
procedure, you can do this in a separate buffer.  Put the new buffer in
`sql-mode' by calling M-x sql-mode.  The name of this buffer can be
anything.  The name of the major mode is SQL.</p>
<p>
In this SQL buffer (SQL mode), you can send the region or the entire
buffer to the interactive SQL buffer (SQLi mode).  The results are
appended to the SQLi buffer without disturbing your SQL buffer.</p>
