<h3>Variable: easy-menu-precalculate-equivalent-keybindings</h3>
<p>
Determine when equivalent key bindings are computed for easy-menu menus.
It can take some time to calculate the equivalent key bindings that are shown
in a menu.  If the variable is on, then this calculation gives a (maybe
noticeable) delay when a mode is first entered.  If the variable is off, then
this delay will come when a menu is displayed the first time.  If you never use
menus, turn this variable off, otherwise it is probably better to keep it on.</p>
