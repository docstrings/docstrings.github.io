<h3>Function: executable-interpret</h3>
<p>
Run script with user-specified args, and collect output in a buffer.<br>
While script runs asynchronously, you can use the C-x `<br>
command to find the next error.  The buffer is also in `comint-mode' and<br>
`compilation-shell-minor-mode', so that you can answer any prompts.</p>
