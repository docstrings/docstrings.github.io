<h3>Function: delete-other-windows</h3>
<p>
Make WINDOW fill its frame.
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.
Return nil.</p>
<p>
If the variable `ignore-window-parameters' is non-nil or the
`delete-other-windows' parameter of WINDOW equals t, do not
process any parameters of WINDOW.  Otherwise, if the
`delete-other-windows' parameter of WINDOW specifies a function,
call that function with WINDOW as its sole argument and return
the value returned by that function.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, if WINDOW is part of an atomic window, call this
function with the root of the atomic window as its argument.  If
WINDOW is a non-side window, make WINDOW the only non-side window
on the frame.  Side windows are not deleted.  If WINDOW is a side
window signal an error.</p>
