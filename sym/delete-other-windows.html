<h3>Function: delete-other-windows</h3>
<p>
Make WINDOW fill its frame.<br>
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.<br>
Return nil.<br>
<br>
If the variable `ignore-window-parameters' is non-nil or the<br>
`delete-other-windows' parameter of WINDOW equals t, do not<br>
process any parameters of WINDOW.  Otherwise, if the<br>
`delete-other-windows' parameter of WINDOW specifies a function,<br>
call that function with WINDOW as its sole argument and return<br>
the value returned by that function.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, if WINDOW is part of an atomic window, call this<br>
function with the root of the atomic window as its argument.  If<br>
WINDOW is a non-side window, make WINDOW the only non-side window<br>
on the frame.  Side windows are not deleted.  If WINDOW is a side
window signal an error.</p>
