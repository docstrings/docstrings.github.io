<h3>Function: window--resize-root-window-vertically</h3>
<p>
Resize root window WINDOW vertically by DELTA lines.<br>
If DELTA is less than zero and we can't shrink WINDOW by DELTA<br>
lines, shrink it as much as possible.  If DELTA is greater than<br>
zero, this function can resize fixed-size windows in order to<br>
recover the necessary lines.<br>
<br>
Return the number of lines that were recovered.<br>
<br>
This function is only called by the minibuffer window resizing<br>
routines.  It resizes windows proportionally and never deletes
any windows.</p>
