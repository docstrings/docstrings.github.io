<h3>Function: xml-parse-file</h3>
<p>
Parse the well-formed XML file FILE.<br>
Return the top node with all its children.<br>
If PARSE-DTD is non-nil, the DTD is parsed rather than skipped.<br>
<br>
If PARSE-NS is non-nil, then QNAMES are expanded.  By default,<br>
the variable `xml-default-ns' is the mapping from namespaces to<br>
URIs, and expanded names will be returned as a cons<br>
<br>
  ("namespace:" . "foo").<br>
<br>
If PARSE-NS is an alist, it will be used as the mapping from<br>
namespace to URIs instead.<br>
<br>
If it is the symbol 'symbol-qnames, expanded names will be<br>
returned as a plain symbol 'namespace:foo instead of a cons.<br>
<br>
Both features can be combined by providing a cons cell<br>

  (symbol-qnames . ALIST).
