<h3>Function: apropos-documentation</h3>
<p>
Show symbols whose documentation contains matches for PATTERN.<br>
PATTERN can be a word, a list of words (separated by spaces),<br>
or a regexp (using some regexp special characters).  If it is a word,<br>
search for matches for that word as a substring.  If it is a list of words,<br>
search for matches for any two (or more) of those words.<br>
<br>
Note that by default this command only searches in the file specified by<br>
`internal-doc-file-name'; i.e., the etc/DOC file.  With C-u prefix,<br>
or if `apropos-do-all' is non-nil, it searches all currently defined<br>
documentation strings.<br>
<br>
Returns list of symbols and documentation found.</p>
