<h3>Function: apropos-documentation</h3>
<p>
Show symbols whose documentation contains matches for PATTERN.
PATTERN can be a word, a list of words (separated by spaces),
or a regexp (using some regexp special characters).  If it is a word,
search for matches for that word as a substring.  If it is a list of words,
search for matches for any two (or more) of those words.</p>
<p>
Note that by default this command only searches in the file specified by
`internal-doc-file-name'; i.e., the etc/DOC file.  With C-u prefix,
or if `apropos-do-all' is non-nil, it searches all currently defined
documentation strings.</p>
<p>
Returns list of symbols and documentation found.</p>
