<h3>Variable: composition-function-table</h3>
<p>
Char-table of functions for automatic character composition.
For each character that has to be composed automatically with
preceding and/or following characters, this char-table contains
a function to call to compose that character.</p>
<p>
The element at index C in the table, if non-nil, is a list of
composition rules of this form: ([PATTERN PREV-CHARS FUNC] ...)</p>
<p>
PATTERN is a regular expression which C and the surrounding
characters must match.</p>
<p>
PREV-CHARS is a non-negative integer (less than 4) specifying how many
characters before C to check the matching with PATTERN.  If it is 0,
PATTERN must match C and the following characters.  If it is 1,
PATTERN must match a character before C and the following characters.</p>
<p>
If PREV-CHARS is 0, PATTERN can be nil, which means that the
single character C should be composed.</p>
<p>
FUNC is a function to return a glyph-string representing a
composition of the characters that match PATTERN.  It is
called with one argument GSTRING.</p>
<p>
GSTRING is a template of a glyph-string to return.  It is already
filled with a proper header for the characters to compose, and
glyphs corresponding to those characters one by one.  The
function must return a new glyph-string with the same header as
GSTRING, or modify GSTRING itself and return it.</p>
