<h3>Variable: composition-function-table</h3>
<p>
Char-table of functions for automatic character composition.<br>
For each character that has to be composed automatically with<br>
preceding and/or following characters, this char-table contains<br>
a function to call to compose that character.<br>
<br>
The element at index C in the table, if non-nil, is a list of<br>
composition rules of this form: ([PATTERN PREV-CHARS FUNC] ...)<br>
<br>
PATTERN is a regular expression which C and the surrounding<br>
characters must match.<br>
<br>
PREV-CHARS is a non-negative integer (less than 4) specifying how many<br>
characters before C to check the matching with PATTERN.  If it is 0,<br>
PATTERN must match C and the following characters.  If it is 1,<br>
PATTERN must match a character before C and the following characters.<br>
<br>
If PREV-CHARS is 0, PATTERN can be nil, which means that the<br>
single character C should be composed.<br>
<br>
FUNC is a function to return a glyph-string representing a<br>
composition of the characters that match PATTERN.  It is<br>
called with one argument GSTRING.<br>
<br>
GSTRING is a template of a glyph-string to return.  It is already<br>
filled with a proper header for the characters to compose, and<br>
glyphs corresponding to those characters one by one.  The<br>
function must return a new glyph-string with the same header as<br>
GSTRING, or modify GSTRING itself and return it.
