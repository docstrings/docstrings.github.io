<h3>Function: server-start</h3>
<p>
Allow this Emacs process to be a server for client processes.
This starts a server communications subprocess through which client
"editors" can send your editing commands to this Emacs job.
To use the server, set up the program `emacsclient' in the Emacs
distribution as your standard "editor".</p>
<p>
Optional argument LEAVE-DEAD (interactively, a prefix arg) means just
kill any existing server communications subprocess.</p>
<p>
If a server is already running, restart it.  If clients are
running, ask the user for confirmation first, unless optional
argument INHIBIT-PROMPT is non-nil.</p>
<p>
To force-start a server, do M-x server-force-delete and then
M-x server-start.</p>
