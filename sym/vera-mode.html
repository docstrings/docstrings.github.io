<h3>Function: vera-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for editing Vera code.</p>
<p>
Usage:
------</p>
<p>
  INDENTATION:  Typing `TAB' at the beginning of a line indents the line.
    The amount of indentation is specified by option `vera-basic-offset'.
    Indentation can be done for an entire region (`M-C-\') or buffer (menu).
    `TAB' always indents the line if option `vera-intelligent-tab' is nil.</p>
<p>
  WORD/COMMAND COMPLETION:  Typing `TAB' after a (not completed) word looks
    for a word in the buffer or a Vera keyword that starts alike, inserts it
    and adjusts case.  Re-typing `TAB' toggles through alternative word
    completions.</p>
<p>
    Typing `TAB' after a non-word character inserts a tabulator stop (if not
    at the beginning of a line).  `M-TAB' always inserts a tabulator stop.</p>
<p>
  COMMENTS:  `C-c C-c' comments out a region if not commented out, and
    uncomments a region if already commented out.</p>
<p>
  HIGHLIGHTING (fontification):  Vera keywords, predefined types and
    constants, function names, declaration names, directives, as well as
    comments and strings are highlighted using different colors.</p>
<p>
  VERA VERSION:  OpenVera 1.4 and Vera version 6.2.8.</p>
