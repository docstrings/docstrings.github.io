<h3>Function: switch-to-buffer</h3>
<p>
Display buffer BUFFER-OR-NAME in the selected window.</p>
<p>
WARNING: This is NOT the way to work on another buffer temporarily
within a Lisp program!  Use `set-buffer' instead.  That avoids
messing with the window-buffer correspondences.</p>
<p>
If the selected window cannot display the specified
buffer (e.g. if it is a minibuffer window or strongly dedicated
to another buffer), call `pop-to-buffer' to select the buffer in
another window.</p>
<p>
If called interactively, read the buffer name using the
minibuffer.  The variable `confirm-nonexistent-file-or-buffer'
determines whether to request confirmation before creating a new
buffer.</p>
<p>
BUFFER-OR-NAME may be a buffer, a string (a buffer name), or nil.
If BUFFER-OR-NAME is a string that does not identify an existing
buffer, create a buffer with that name.  If BUFFER-OR-NAME is
nil, switch to the buffer returned by `other-buffer'.</p>
<p>
If optional argument NORECORD is non-nil, do not put the buffer
at the front of the buffer list, and do not make the window
displaying it the most recently selected one.</p>
<p>
If optional argument FORCE-SAME-WINDOW is non-nil, the buffer
must be displayed in the selected window; if that is impossible,
signal an error rather than calling `pop-to-buffer'.</p>
<p>
The option `switch-to-buffer-preserve-window-point' can be used
to make the buffer appear at its last position in the selected
window.</p>
<p>
Return the buffer switched to.</p>
