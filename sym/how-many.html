<h3>Function: how-many</h3>
<p>
Print and return number of matches for REGEXP following point.
When called from Lisp and INTERACTIVE is omitted or nil, just return
the number, do not print it; if INTERACTIVE is t, the function behaves
in all respects as if it had been called interactively.</p>
<p>
If REGEXP contains upper case characters (excluding those preceded by `\')
and `search-upper-case' is non-nil, the matching is case-sensitive.</p>
<p>
Second and third arg RSTART and REND specify the region to operate on.</p>
<p>
Interactively, in Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, operate
on the contents of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the
end of (the accessible portion of) the buffer.</p>
<p>
This function starts looking for the next match from the end of
the previous match.  Hence, it ignores matches that overlap
a previously found match.</p>
