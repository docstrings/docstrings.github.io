<h3>Variable: directory-free-space-program</h3>
<p>
Program to get the amount of free space on a file system.
We assume the output has the format of `df'.
The value of this variable must be just a command name or file name;
if you want to specify options, use `directory-free-space-args'.</p>
<p>
A value of nil disables this feature.</p>
<p>
If the function `file-system-info' is defined, it is always used in
preference to the program given by this variable.</p>
