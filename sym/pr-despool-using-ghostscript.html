<h3>Function: pr-despool-using-ghostscript</h3>
<p>
Print spooled PostScript using ghostscript.<br>
<br>
Interactively, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the<br>
user for a file name, and saves the spooled PostScript image in that file<br>
instead of sending it to the printer.<br>
<br>
Noninteractively, the argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it is nil,<br>
send the image to the printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save the PostScript<br>
image in a file with that name.

(fn &optional FILENAME)</p>
