<h3>Function: eshell</h3>
<p>
Create an interactive Eshell buffer.
The buffer used for Eshell sessions is determined by the value of
`eshell-buffer-name'.  If there is already an Eshell session active in
that buffer, Emacs will simply switch to it.  Otherwise, a new session
will begin.  A numeric prefix arg (as in `C-u 42 M-x eshell RET')
switches to the session with that number, creating it if necessary.  A
nonnumeric prefix arg means to create a new session.  Returns the
buffer selected (or created).</p>
