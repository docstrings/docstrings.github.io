<h3>Function: parse-colon-path</h3>
<p>
Explode a search path into a list of directory names.
Directories are separated by `path-separator' (which is colon in
GNU and Unix systems).  Substitute environment variables into the
resulting list of directory names.  For an empty path element (i.e.,
a leading or trailing separator, or two adjacent separators), return
nil (meaning `default-directory') as the associated list element.</p>
