<h3>Function: image-type-auto-detected-p</h3>
<p>
Return t if the current buffer contains an auto-detectable image.
This function is intended to be used from `magic-fallback-mode-alist'.</p>
<p>
The buffer is considered to contain an auto-detectable image if
its beginning matches an image type in `image-type-header-regexps',
and that image type is present in `image-type-auto-detectable' with a
non-nil value.  If that value is non-nil, but not t, then the image type
must be available.</p>
