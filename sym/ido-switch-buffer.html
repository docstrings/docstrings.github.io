<h3>Function: ido-switch-buffer</h3>
<p>
Switch to another buffer.
The buffer is displayed according to `ido-default-buffer-method' -- the
default is to show it in the same window, unless it is already visible
in another frame.</p>
<p>
As you type in a string, all of the buffers matching the string are
displayed if substring-matching is used (default).  Look at
`ido-enable-prefix' and `ido-toggle-prefix'.  When you have found the
buffer you want, it can then be selected.  As you type, most keys have
their normal keybindings, except for the following: 
Uses keymap `ido-buffer-completion-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>

RET Select the buffer at the front of the list of matches.  If the
list is empty, possibly prompt to create new buffer.</p>
<p>

M-x ido-next-match Put the first element at the end of the list.

in a separate window.
