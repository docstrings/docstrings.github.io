<h3>Variable: hs-special-modes-alist</h3>
<p>
Alist for initializing the hideshow variables for different modes.
Each element has the form
  (MODE START END COMMENT-START FORWARD-SEXP-FUNC ADJUST-BEG-FUNC).</p>
<p>
If non-nil, hideshow will use these values as regexps to define blocks
and comments, respectively for major mode MODE.</p>
<p>
START, END and COMMENT-START are regular expressions.  A block is
defined as text surrounded by START and END.</p>
<p>
As a special case, START may be a list of the form (COMPLEX-START
MDATA-SELECTOR), where COMPLEX-START is a regexp w/ multiple parts and
MDATA-SELECTOR an integer that specifies which sub-match is the proper
place to adjust point, before calling `hs-forward-sexp-func'.  Point
is adjusted to the beginning of the specified match.  For example,
see the `hs-special-modes-alist' entry for `bibtex-mode'.</p>
<p>
For some major modes, `forward-sexp' does not work properly.  In those
cases, FORWARD-SEXP-FUNC specifies another function to use instead.</p>
<p>
See the documentation for `hs-adjust-block-beginning' to see what is the
use of ADJUST-BEG-FUNC.</p>
<p>
If any of the elements is left nil or omitted, hideshow tries to guess
appropriate values.  The regexps should not contain leading or trailing
whitespace.  Case does not matter.</p>
