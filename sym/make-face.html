<h3>Function: make-face</h3>
<p>
Define a new face with name FACE, a symbol.
Do not call this directly from Lisp code; use `defface' instead.</p>
<p>
If NO-INIT-FROM-RESOURCES is non-nil, don't initialize face
attributes from X resources.  If FACE is already known as a face,
leave it unmodified.  Return FACE.</p>
