<h3>Variable: byte-compile-generate-call-tree</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means collect call-graph information when compiling.<br>
This records which functions were called and from where.<br>
If the value is t, compilation displays the call graph when it finishes.<br>
If the value is neither t nor nil, compilation asks you whether to display<br>
the graph.<br>
<br>
The call tree only lists functions called, not macros used. Those functions<br>
which the byte-code interpreter knows about directly (eq, cons, etc.) are<br>
not reported.<br>
<br>
The call tree also lists those functions which are not known to be called<br>
(that is, to which no calls have been compiled).  Functions which can be<br>
invoked interactively are excluded from this list.</p>
