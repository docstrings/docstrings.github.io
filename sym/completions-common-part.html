<h3>Face: completions-common-part</h3>
<p>
Face put on the common prefix substring in completions in *Completions* buffer.
The idea of `completions-common-part' is that you can use it to
make the common parts less visible than normal, so that the rest
of the differing parts is, by contrast, slightly highlighted.</p>
