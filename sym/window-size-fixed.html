<h3>Variable: window-size-fixed</h3>
<p>
Non-nil in a buffer means windows displaying the buffer are fixed-size.
If the value is `height', then only the window's height is fixed.
If the value is `width', then only the window's width is fixed.
Any other non-nil value fixes both the width and the height.</p>
<p>
Emacs won't change the size of any window displaying that buffer,
unless it has no other choice (like when deleting a neighboring
window).</p>
