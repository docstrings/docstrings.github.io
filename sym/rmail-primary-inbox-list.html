<h3>Variable: rmail-primary-inbox-list</h3>
<p>
List of files that are inboxes for your primary mail file `rmail-file-name'.
If this is nil, uses the environment variable MAIL.  If that is
unset, uses a file named by the function `user-login-name' in the
directory `rmail-spool-directory' (whose value depends on the
operating system).  For example, "/var/mail/USER".</p>
