<h3>Variable: dabbrev-check-all-buffers</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means dabbrev package should search *all* buffers.<br>
<br>
Dabbrev always searches the current buffer first.  Then, if<br>
`dabbrev-check-other-buffers' says so, it searches the buffers<br>
designated by `dabbrev-select-buffers-function'.<br>
<br>
Then, if `dabbrev-check-all-buffers' is non-nil, dabbrev searches<br>
all the other buffers, except those named in `dabbrev-ignored-buffer-names',<br>
or matched by `dabbrev-ignored-regexps'.</p>
