<h3>Function: comint-kill-whole-line</h3>
<p>
Kill current line, ignoring read-only and field properties.<br>
With prefix arg COUNT, kill that many lines starting from the current line.<br>
If COUNT is negative, kill backward.  Also kill the preceding newline,<br>
instead of the trailing one.  (This is meant to make C-x z work well<br>
with negative arguments.)<br>
If COUNT is zero, kill current line but exclude the trailing newline.<br>
The read-only status of newlines is updated with `comint-update-fence',<br>
if necessary.

(fn &optional COUNT)</p>
