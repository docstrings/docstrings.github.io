<h3>Function: buffer-substring</h3>
<p>
Return the contents of part of the current buffer as a string.
The two arguments START and END are character positions;
they can be in either order.
The string returned is multibyte if the buffer is multibyte.</p>
<p>
This function copies the text properties of that part of the buffer
into the result string; if you don't want the text properties,
use `buffer-substring-no-properties' instead.</p>
<p>
(fn START END)</p>
