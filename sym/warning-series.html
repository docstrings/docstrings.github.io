<h3>Variable: warning-series</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means treat multiple `display-warning' calls as a series.<br>
A marker indicates a position in the warnings buffer<br>
which is the start of the current series; it means that<br>
additional warnings in the same buffer should not move point.<br>
If t, the next warning begins a series (and stores a marker here).<br>
A symbol with a function definition is like t, except<br>
also call that function before the next warning.</p>
