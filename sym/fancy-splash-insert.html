<h3>Function: fancy-splash-insert</h3>
<p>
Insert text into the current buffer, with faces.<br>
Arguments from ARGS should be either strings; functions called<br>
with no args that return a string; pairs `:face FACE', where FACE<br>
is a face specification usable with `put-text-property'; or pairs<br>
`:link LINK' where LINK is a list of arguments to pass to<br>
`insert-button', of the form (LABEL ACTION [HELP-ECHO]), which<br>
specifies the button's label, `action' property and help-echo string.<br>
FACE and LINK can also be functions, which are evaluated to obtain<br>
a face or button specification.
