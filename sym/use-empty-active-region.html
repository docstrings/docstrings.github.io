<h3>Variable: use-empty-active-region</h3>
<p>
Whether "region-aware" commands should act on empty regions.<br>
If nil, region-aware commands treat empty regions as inactive.<br>
If non-nil, region-aware commands treat the region as active as<br>
long as the mark is active, even if the region is empty.<br>
<br>
Region-aware commands are those that act on the region if it is<br>
active and Transient Mark mode is enabled, and on the text near
point otherwise.</p>
