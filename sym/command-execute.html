<h3>Function: command-execute</h3>
<p>
Execute CMD as an editor command.
CMD must be a symbol that satisfies the `commandp' predicate.
Optional second arg RECORD-FLAG non-nil
means unconditionally put this command in `command-history'.
Otherwise, that is done only if an arg is read using the minibuffer.
The argument KEYS specifies the value to use instead of (this-command-keys)
when reading the arguments; if it is nil, (this-command-keys) is used.
The argument SPECIAL, if non-nil, means that this command is executing
a special event, so ignore the prefix argument and don't clear it.</p>
