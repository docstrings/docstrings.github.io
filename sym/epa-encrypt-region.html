<h3>Function: epa-encrypt-region</h3>
<p>
Encrypt the current region between START and END for RECIPIENTS.<br>
<br>
Don't use this command in Lisp programs!<br>
Since this function operates on regions, it does some tricks such<br>
as coding-system detection and unibyte/multibyte conversion.  If<br>
you are sure how the data should be treated, you should consider<br>
using the string based counterpart `epg-encrypt-string', or the<br>
file based counterpart `epg-encrypt-file' instead.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
(let ((context (epg-make-context 'OpenPGP)))<br>
  (epg-encrypt-string<br>
    context<br>
    (encode-coding-string (buffer-substring start end) 'utf-8)
    nil))

(fn START END RECIPIENTS SIGN SIGNERS)</p>
