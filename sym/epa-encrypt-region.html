<h3>Function: epa-encrypt-region</h3>
<p>
Encrypt the current region between START and END for RECIPIENTS.</p>
<p>
Don't use this command in Lisp programs!
Since this function operates on regions, it does some tricks such
as coding-system detection and unibyte/multibyte conversion.  If
you are sure how the data should be treated, you should consider
using the string based counterpart `epg-encrypt-string', or the
file based counterpart `epg-encrypt-file' instead.</p>
<p>
For example:</p>
<p>
(let ((context (epg-make-context 'OpenPGP)))
  (epg-encrypt-string
    context
    (encode-coding-string (buffer-substring start end) 'utf-8)
    nil))</p>
<p>
(fn START END RECIPIENTS SIGN SIGNERS)</p>
