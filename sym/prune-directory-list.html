<h3>Function: prune-directory-list</h3>
<p>
Return a copy of DIRS with all non-existent directories removed.
The optional argument KEEP is a list of directories to retain even if
they don't exist, and REJECT is a list of directories to remove from
DIRS, even if they exist; REJECT takes precedence over KEEP.</p>
<p>
Note that membership in REJECT and KEEP is checked using simple string
comparison.</p>
