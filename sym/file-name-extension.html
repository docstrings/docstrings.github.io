<h3>Function: file-name-extension</h3>
<p>
Return FILENAME's final "extension".
The extension, in a file name, is the part that follows the last `.',
excluding version numbers and backup suffixes,
except that a leading `.', if any, doesn't count.
Return nil for extensionless file names such as `foo'.
Return the empty string for file names such as `foo.'.</p>
<p>
If PERIOD is non-nil, then the returned value includes the period
that delimits the extension, and if FILENAME has no extension,
the value is "".</p>
