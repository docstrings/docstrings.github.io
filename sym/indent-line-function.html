<h3>Variable: indent-line-function</h3>
<p>
Function to indent the current line.<br>
This function will be called with no arguments.<br>
If it is called somewhere where auto-indentation cannot be done<br>
(e.g. inside a string), the function should simply return `noindent'.<br>
Setting this function is all you need to make TAB indent appropriately.<br>
Don't rebind TAB unless you really need to.</p>
