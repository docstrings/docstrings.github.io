<h3>Function: previous-single-property-change</h3>
<p>
Return the position of previous property change for a specific property.<br>
Scans characters backward from POSITION till it finds<br>
a change in the PROP property, then returns the position of the change.<br>
If the optional third argument OBJECT is a buffer (or nil, which means<br>
the current buffer), POSITION is a buffer position (integer or marker).<br>
If OBJECT is a string, POSITION is a 0-based index into it.<br>
The property values are compared with `eq'.<br>
Return nil if the property is constant all the way to the start of OBJECT.<br>
If the value is non-nil, it is a position less than POSITION, never equal.<br>
<br>
If the optional fourth argument LIMIT is non-nil, don't search<br>
back past position LIMIT; return LIMIT if nothing is found until LIMIT.
