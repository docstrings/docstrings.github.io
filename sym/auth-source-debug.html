<h3>Variable: auth-source-debug</h3>
<p>
Whether auth-source should log debug messages.</p>
<p>
If the value is nil, debug messages are not logged.</p>
<p>
If the value is t, debug messages are logged with `message'.  In
that case, your authentication data will be in the clear (except
for passwords).</p>
<p>
If the value is a function, debug messages are logged by calling
 that function using the same arguments as `message'.</p>
