<h3>Variable: blink-matching-paren-on-screen</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means show matching open-paren when it is on screen.<br>
If nil, don't show it (but the open-paren can still be shown<br>
when it is off screen).<br>
<br>
This variable has no effect if `blink-matching-paren' is nil.<br>
(In that case, the open-paren is never shown.)<br>
It is also ignored if `show-paren-mode' is enabled.</p>
