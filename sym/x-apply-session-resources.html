<h3>Function: x-apply-session-resources</h3>
<p>
Apply X resources which specify initial values for Emacs variables.
This is called from a window-system initialization function, such
as `x-initialize-window-system' for X, either at startup (prior
to reading the init file), or afterwards when the user first
opens a graphical frame.</p>
<p>
This can set the values of `menu-bar-mode', `tool-bar-mode', and
`no-blinking-cursor', as well as the `cursor' face.  Changed
settings will be marked as "CHANGED outside of Customize".</p>
