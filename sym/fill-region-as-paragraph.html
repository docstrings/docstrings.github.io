<h3>Function: fill-region-as-paragraph</h3>
<p>
Fill the region as one paragraph.<br>
It removes any paragraph breaks in the region and extra newlines at the end,<br>
indents and fills lines between the margins given by the<br>
`current-left-margin' and `current-fill-column' functions.<br>
(In most cases, the variable `fill-column' controls the width.)<br>
It leaves point at the beginning of the line following the paragraph.<br>
<br>
Normally performs justification according to the `current-justification'<br>
function, but with a prefix arg, does full justification instead.<br>
<br>
From a program, optional third arg JUSTIFY can specify any type of<br>
justification.  Fourth arg NOSQUEEZE non-nil means not to make spaces<br>
between words canonical before filling.  Fifth arg SQUEEZE-AFTER, if non-nil,<br>
means don't canonicalize spaces before that position.<br>
<br>
Return the `fill-prefix' used for filling.<br>
<br>
If `sentence-end-double-space' is non-nil, then period followed by one
space does not end a sentence, so don't break a line there.</p>
