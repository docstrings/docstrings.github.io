<h3>Variable: split-window-preferred-function</h3>
<p>
Function called by `display-buffer' routines to split a window.<br>
This function is called with a window as single argument and is<br>
supposed to split that window and return the new window.  If the<br>
window can (or shall) not be split, it is supposed to return nil.<br>
The default is to call the function `split-window-sensibly' which<br>
tries to split the window in a way which seems most suitable.<br>
You can customize the options `split-height-threshold' and/or<br>
`split-width-threshold' in order to have `split-window-sensibly'<br>
prefer either vertical or horizontal splitting.<br>
<br>
If you set this to any other function, bear in mind that the<br>
`display-buffer' routines may call this function two times.  The<br>
argument of the first call is the largest window on its frame.<br>
If that call fails to return a live window, the function is<br>
called again with the least recently used window as argument.  If<br>
that call fails too, `display-buffer' will use an existing window<br>
to display its buffer.<br>
<br>
The window selected at the time `display-buffer' was invoked is<br>
still selected when this function is called.  Hence you can<br>
compare the window argument with the value of `selected-window'<br>
if you intend to split the selected window instead or if you do
not want to split the selected window.</p>
