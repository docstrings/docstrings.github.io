<h3>Function: current-input-mode</h3>
<p>
Return information about the way Emacs currently reads keyboard input.
The value is a list of the form (INTERRUPT FLOW META QUIT), where
  INTERRUPT is non-nil if Emacs is using interrupt-driven input; if
    nil, Emacs is using CBREAK mode.
  FLOW is non-nil if Emacs uses ^S/^Q flow control for output to the
    terminal; this does not apply if Emacs uses interrupt-driven input.
  META is t if accepting 8-bit input with 8th bit as Meta flag.
    META nil means ignoring the top bit, on the assumption it is parity.
    META is neither t nor nil if accepting 8-bit input and using
    all 8 bits as the character code.
  QUIT is the character Emacs currently uses to quit.
The elements of this list correspond to the arguments of
`set-input-mode'.</p>
