<h3>Variable: lisp-tag-body-indentation</h3>
<p>
Indentation of non-tagged lines relative to containing list.<br>
This variable is used by the function `lisp-indent-tagbody' to indent normal<br>
lines (lines without tags).<br>
The indentation is relative to the indentation of the parenthesis enclosing<br>
the special form.  If the value is t, the body of tags will be indented<br>
as a block at the same indentation as the first s-expression following<br>
the tag.  In this case, any forms before the first tag are indented
by `lisp-body-indent'.</p>
