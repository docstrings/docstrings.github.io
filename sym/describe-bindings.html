<h3>Function: describe-bindings</h3>
<p>
Show a list of all defined keys, and their definitions.<br>
We put that list in a buffer, and display the buffer.<br>
<br>
The optional argument PREFIX, if non-nil, should be a key sequence;<br>
then we display only bindings that start with that prefix.<br>
The optional argument BUFFER specifies which buffer's bindings<br>
to display (default, the current buffer).  BUFFER can be a buffer
or a buffer name.</p>
