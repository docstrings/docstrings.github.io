<h3>Function: walk-window-subtree</h3>
<p>
Run function FUN on the subtree of windows rooted at WINDOW.
WINDOW defaults to the selected window.  FUN must be a function
with one argument - a window.  By default, run FUN only on live
windows of the subtree.  If the optional argument ANY is non-nil,
run FUN on all live and internal windows of the subtree.  If
WINDOW is live, run FUN on WINDOW only.</p>
<p>
This function performs a pre-order, depth-first traversal of the
subtree rooted at WINDOW.  If FUN changes that tree, the result
is unpredictable.</p>
