<h3>Variable: auto-composition-function</h3>
<p>
Function to call to compose characters automatically.<br>
This function is called from the display routine with four arguments:<br>
FROM, TO, WINDOW, and STRING.<br>
<br>
If STRING is nil, the function must compose characters in the region<br>
between FROM and TO in the current buffer.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, STRING is a string, and FROM and TO are indices into the<br>
string.  In this case, the function must compose characters in the
string.</p>
