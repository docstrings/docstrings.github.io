<h3>Variable: minibuffer-completion-table</h3>
<p>
Alist or obarray used for completion in the minibuffer.
This becomes the ALIST argument to `try-completion' and `all-completions'.
The value can also be a list of strings or a hash table.</p>
<p>
The value may alternatively be a function, which is given three arguments:
  STRING, the current buffer contents;
  PREDICATE, the predicate for filtering possible matches;
  CODE, which says what kind of things to do.
CODE can be nil, t or `lambda':
  nil    -- return the best completion of STRING, or nil if there is none.
  t      -- return a list of all possible completions of STRING.
  lambda -- return t if STRING is a valid completion as it stands.</p>
