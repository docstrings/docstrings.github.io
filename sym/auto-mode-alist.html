<h3>Variable: auto-mode-alist</h3>
<p>
Alist of filename patterns vs corresponding major mode functions.<br>
Each element looks like (REGEXP . FUNCTION) or (REGEXP FUNCTION NON-NIL).<br>
(NON-NIL stands for anything that is not nil; the value does not matter.)<br>
Visiting a file whose name matches REGEXP specifies FUNCTION as the<br>
mode function to use.  FUNCTION will be called, unless it is nil.<br>
<br>
If the element has the form (REGEXP FUNCTION NON-NIL), then after<br>
calling FUNCTION (if it's not nil), we delete the suffix that matched<br>
REGEXP and search the list again for another match.<br>
<br>
The extensions whose FUNCTION is `archive-mode' should also<br>
appear in `auto-coding-alist' with `no-conversion' coding system.<br>
<br>
See also `interpreter-mode-alist', which detects executable script modes<br>
based on the interpreters they specify to run,<br>
and `magic-mode-alist', which determines modes based on file contents.</p>
