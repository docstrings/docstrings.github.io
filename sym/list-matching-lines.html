<h3>Function: list-matching-lines</h3>
<p>
Show all lines in the current buffer containing a match for REGEXP.
If a match spreads across multiple lines, all those lines are shown.</p>
<p>
Each line is displayed with NLINES lines before and after, or -NLINES
before if NLINES is negative.
NLINES defaults to `list-matching-lines-default-context-lines'.
Interactively it is the prefix arg.</p>
<p>
The lines are shown in a buffer named `*Occur*'.
It serves as a menu to find any of the occurrences in this buffer.
C-h m in that buffer will explain how.</p>
<p>
If REGEXP contains upper case characters (excluding those preceded by `\')
and `search-upper-case' is non-nil, the matching is case-sensitive.</p>
<p>
When NLINES is a string or when the function is called
interactively with prefix argument without a number (`C-u' alone
as prefix) the matching strings are collected into the `*Occur*'
buffer by using NLINES as a replacement regexp.  NLINES may
contain \& and \N which convention follows `replace-match'.
For example, providing "defun\s +\(\S +\)" for REGEXP and
"\1" for NLINES collects all the function names in a lisp
program.  When there is no parenthesized subexpressions in REGEXP
the entire match is collected.  In any case the searched buffer
is not modified.</p>
