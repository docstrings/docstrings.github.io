<h3>Variable: completion-base-size</h3>
<p>
Number of chars before point not involved in completion.<br>
This is a local variable in the completion list buffer.<br>
It refers to the chars in the minibuffer if completing in the<br>
minibuffer, or in `completion-reference-buffer' otherwise.<br>
Only characters in the field at point are included.<br>
<br>
If nil, Emacs determines which part of the tail end of the<br>
buffer's text is involved in completion by comparing the text
directly.</p>
