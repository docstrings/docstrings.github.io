<h3>Function: text-property-not-all</h3>
<p>
Check text from START to END for property PROPERTY not equaling VALUE.<br>
If so, return the position of the first character whose property PROPERTY<br>
is not `eq' to VALUE.  Otherwise, return nil.<br>
If the optional fifth argument OBJECT is a buffer (or nil, which means<br>
the current buffer), START and END are buffer positions (integers or<br>
markers).  If OBJECT is a string, START and END are 0-based indices into it.<br>
<br>
(fn START END PROPERTY VALUE &optional OBJECT)</p>
