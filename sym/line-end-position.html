<h3>Function: line-end-position</h3>
<p>
Return the character position of the last character on the current line.
With argument N not nil or 1, move forward N - 1 lines first.
If scan reaches end of buffer, return that position.</p>
<p>
This function ignores text display directionality; it returns the
position of the last character in logical order, i.e. the largest
character position on the line.</p>
<p>
This function constrains the returned position to the current field
unless that would be on a different line than the original,
unconstrained result.  If N is nil or 1, and a rear-sticky field ends
at point, the scan stops as soon as it starts.  To ignore field
boundaries bind `inhibit-field-text-motion' to t.</p>
<p>
This function does not move point.</p>
