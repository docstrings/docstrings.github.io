<h3>Variable: smie-indent-functions</h3>
<p>
Functions to compute the indentation.<br>
Each function is called with no argument, shouldn't move point, and should<br>
return either nil if it has no opinion, or an integer representing the column<br>
to which that point should be aligned, if we were to reindent it.</p>
