<h3>Variable: search-whitespace-regexp</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, regular expression to match a sequence of whitespace chars.<br>
When you enter a space or spaces in the incremental search, it<br>
will match any sequence matched by this regexp.  As an exception,<br>
spaces are treated normally in regexp incremental search if they<br>
occur in a regexp construct like [...] or *, + or ?.<br>
<br>
If the value is a string, it applies to both ordinary and<br>
regexp incremental search.  If the value is nil, or<br>
`isearch-lax-whitespace' is nil for ordinary incremental search, or<br>
`isearch-regexp-lax-whitespace' is nil for regexp incremental search,<br>
then each space you type matches literally, against one space.<br>
<br>
You might want to use something like "[ \t\r\n]+" instead.<br>
In the Customization buffer, that is `[' followed by a space,<br>
a tab, a carriage return (control-M), a newline, and `]+'.</p>
