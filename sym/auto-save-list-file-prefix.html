<h3>Variable: auto-save-list-file-prefix</h3>
<p>
Prefix for generating `auto-save-list-file-name'.<br>
This is used after reading your init file to initialize<br>
`auto-save-list-file-name', by appending Emacs's pid and the system name,<br>
if you have not already set `auto-save-list-file-name' yourself.<br>
Directories in the prefix will be created if necessary.<br>
Set this to nil if you want to prevent `auto-save-list-file-name'<br>
from being initialized.</p>
