<h3>Variable: auto-save-list-file-prefix</h3>
<p>
Prefix for generating `auto-save-list-file-name'.
This is used after reading your init file to initialize
`auto-save-list-file-name', by appending Emacs's pid and the system name,
if you have not already set `auto-save-list-file-name' yourself.
Directories in the prefix will be created if necessary.
Set this to nil if you want to prevent `auto-save-list-file-name'
from being initialized.</p>
