<h3>Variable: comint-scroll-show-maximum-output</h3>
<p>
Controls how to scroll due to interpreter output.<br>
This variable applies when point is at the end of the buffer<br>
(either because it was originally there, or because<br>
`comint-move-point-for-output' said to move it there)<br>
and output from the subprocess is inserted.<br>
<br>
Non-nil means scroll so that the window is full of text<br>
and point is on the last line.  A value of nil<br>
means don't do anything special--scroll normally.<br>
<br>
See also the variable `comint-move-point-for-output' and the function<br>
`comint-postoutput-scroll-to-bottom'.<br>
This variable is buffer-local in all Comint buffers.</p>
