<h3>Variable: user-init-file</h3>
<p>
File name, including directory, of user's initialization file.
If the file loaded had extension `.elc', and the corresponding source file
exists, this variable contains the name of source file, suitable for use
by functions like `custom-save-all' which edit the init file.
While Emacs loads and evaluates the init file, value is the real name
of the file, regardless of whether or not it has the `.elc' extension.</p>
