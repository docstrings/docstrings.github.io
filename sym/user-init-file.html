<h3>Variable: user-init-file</h3>
<p>
File name, including directory, of user's initialization file.<br>
If the file loaded had extension `.elc', and the corresponding source file<br>
exists, this variable contains the name of source file, suitable for use<br>
by functions like `custom-save-all' which edit the init file.<br>
While Emacs loads and evaluates the init file, value is the real name<br>
of the file, regardless of whether or not it has the `.elc' extension.</p>
