<h3>Variable: menu-prompting</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means prompt with menus when appropriate.<br>
This is done when reading from a keymap that has a prompt string,<br>
for elements that have prompt strings.<br>
The menu is displayed on the screen<br>
if X menus were enabled at configuration<br>
time and the previous event was a mouse click prefix key.<br>
Otherwise, menu prompting uses the echo area.</p>
