<h3>Variable: comment-multi-line</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means `comment-indent-new-line' continues comments.
That is, it inserts no new terminator or starter.
This affects `auto-fill-mode', which is the main reason to
customize this variable.</p>
<p>
It also affects C-M-j.  However, if you want this
behavior for explicit filling, you might as well use C-j.</p>
