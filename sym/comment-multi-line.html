<h3>Variable: comment-multi-line</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means `comment-indent-new-line' continues comments.<br>
That is, it inserts no new terminator or starter.<br>
This affects `auto-fill-mode', which is the main reason to<br>
customize this variable.<br>
<br>
It also affects C-M-j.  However, if you want this<br>
behavior for explicit filling, you might as well use C-j.</p>
