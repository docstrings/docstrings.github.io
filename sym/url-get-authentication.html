<h3>Function: url-get-authentication</h3>
<p>
Return an authorization string suitable for use in the WWW-Authenticate
header in an HTTP/1.0 request.</p>
<p>
URL    is the url you are requesting authorization to.  This can be either a
       string representing the URL, or the parsed representation returned by
       `url-generic-parse-url'
REALM  is the realm at a specific site we are looking for.  This should be a
       string specifying the exact realm, or nil or the symbol 'any' to
       specify that the filename portion of the URL should be used as the
       realm
TYPE   is the type of authentication to be returned.  This is either a string
       representing the type (basic, digest, etc), or nil or the symbol 'any'
       to specify that any authentication is acceptable.  If requesting 'any'
       the strongest matching authentication will be returned.  If this is
       wrong, it's no big deal, the error from the server will specify exactly
       what type of auth to use
PROMPT is boolean - specifies whether to ask the user for a username/password
       if one cannot be found in the cache</p>
