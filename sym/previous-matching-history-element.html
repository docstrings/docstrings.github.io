<h3>Function: previous-matching-history-element</h3>
<p>
Find the previous history element that matches REGEXP.
(Previous history elements refer to earlier actions.)
With prefix argument N, search for Nth previous match.
If N is negative, find the next or Nth next match.
Normally, history elements are matched case-insensitively if
`case-fold-search' is non-nil, but an uppercase letter in REGEXP
makes the search case-sensitive.
