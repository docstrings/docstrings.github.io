<h3>Function: url-generic-parse-url</h3>
<p>
Return an URL-struct of the parts of URL.
The CL-style struct contains the following fields:</p>
<p>
TYPE     is the URI scheme (string or nil).
USER     is the user name (string or nil).
PASSWORD is the password (string [deprecated] or nil).
HOST     is the host (a registered name, IP literal in square
         brackets, or IPv4 address in dotted-decimal form).
PORTSPEC is the specified port (a number), or nil.
FILENAME is the path AND the query component of the URI.
TARGET   is the fragment identifier component (used to refer to a
         subordinate resource, e.g. a part of a webpage).
ATTRIBUTES is nil; this slot originally stored the attribute and
         value alists for IMAP URIs, but this feature was removed
         since it conflicts with RFC 3986.
FULLNESS is non-nil iff the hierarchical sequence component of
         the URL starts with two slashes, "//".</p>
<p>
The parser follows RFC 3986, except that it also tries to handle
URIs that are not fully specified (e.g. lacking TYPE), and it
does not check for or perform %-encoding.</p>
<p>
Here is an example.  The URL</p>
<p>
  foo://bob:pass@example.com:42/a/b/c.dtb?type=animal&name=narwhal#nose</p>
<p>
parses to</p>
<p>
  TYPE     = "foo"
  USER     = "bob"
  PASSWORD = "pass"
  HOST     = "example.com"
  PORTSPEC = 42
  FILENAME = "/a/b/c.dtb?type=animal&name=narwhal"
  TARGET   = "nose"
  ATTRIBUTES = nil
  FULLNESS = t</p>
