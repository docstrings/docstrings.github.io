<h3>Variable: view-read-only</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means buffers visiting files read-only do so in view mode.<br>
In fact, this means that all read-only buffers normally have<br>
View mode enabled, including buffers that are read-only because<br>
you visit a file you cannot alter, and buffers you make read-only<br>
using M-x toggle-read-only.</p>
