<h3>Function: documentation-property</h3>
<p>
Return the documentation string that is SYMBOL's PROP property.
Third argument RAW omitted or nil means pass the result through
`substitute-command-keys' if it is a string.</p>
<p>
This differs from `get' in that it can refer to strings stored in the
`etc/DOC' file; and that it evaluates documentation properties that
aren't strings.</p>
<p>
(fn SYMBOL PROP &optional RAW)</p>
