<h3>Function: image-load-path-for-library</h3>
<p>
Return a suitable search path for images used by LIBRARY.</p>
<p>
It searches for IMAGE in `image-load-path' (excluding
"`data-directory'/images") and `load-path', followed by a path
suitable for LIBRARY, which includes "../../etc/images" and
"../etc/images" relative to the library file itself, and then
in "`data-directory'/images".</p>
<p>
Then this function returns a list of directories which contains
first the directory in which IMAGE was found, followed by the
value of `load-path'.  If PATH is given, it is used instead of
`load-path'.</p>
<p>
If NO-ERROR is non-nil and a suitable path can't be found, don't
signal an error.  Instead, return a list of directories as before,
except that nil appears in place of the image directory.</p>
<p>
Here is an example that uses a common idiom to provide
compatibility with versions of Emacs that lack the variable
`image-load-path':</p>
<p>
    ;; Shush compiler.
    (defvar image-load-path)</p>
<p>
    (let* ((load-path (image-load-path-for-library "mh-e" "mh-logo.xpm"))
           (image-load-path (cons (car load-path)
                                  (when (boundp 'image-load-path)
                                    image-load-path))))
      (mh-tool-bar-folder-buttons-init))</p>
