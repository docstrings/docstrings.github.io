<h3>Function: save-buffers-kill-emacs</h3>
<p>
Offer to save each buffer, then kill this Emacs process.<br>
With prefix ARG, silently save all file-visiting buffers without asking.<br>
If there are active processes where `process-query-on-exit-flag'<br>
returns non-nil, asks whether processes should be killed.<br>
Runs the members of `kill-emacs-query-functions' in turn and stops<br>
if any returns nil.  If `confirm-kill-emacs' is non-nil, calls it.</p>
