<h3>Variable: select-active-regions</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, an active region automatically sets the primary selection.
If the value is `only', only temporarily active regions (usually made
by mouse-dragging or shift-selection) set the window selection.</p>
<p>
This takes effect only when Transient Mark mode is enabled.</p>
