<h3>Function: lisp-indent-function</h3>
<p>
This function is the normal value of the variable `lisp-indent-function'.
The function `calculate-lisp-indent' calls this to determine
if the arguments of a Lisp function call should be indented specially.</p>
<p>
INDENT-POINT is the position at which the line being indented begins.
Point is located at the point to indent under (for default indentation);
STATE is the `parse-partial-sexp' state for that position.</p>
<p>
If the current line is in a call to a Lisp function that has a non-nil
property `lisp-indent-function' (or the deprecated `lisp-indent-hook'),
it specifies how to indent.  The property value can be:</p>
<p>
* `defun', meaning indent `defun'-style
  (this is also the case if there is no property and the function
  has a name that begins with "def", and three or more arguments);</p>
<p>
* an integer N, meaning indent the first N arguments specially
  (like ordinary function arguments), and then indent any further
  arguments like a body;</p>
<p>
* a function to call that returns the indentation (or nil).
  `lisp-indent-function' calls this function with the same two arguments
  that it itself received.</p>
<p>
This function returns either the indentation to use, or nil if the
Lisp function does not specify a special indentation.</p>
<h3>Variable: lisp-indent-function</h3>
<p>
A function to be called by `calculate-lisp-indent'.
It indents the arguments of a Lisp function call.  This function
should accept two arguments: the indent-point, and the
`parse-partial-sexp' state at that position.  One option for this
function is `common-lisp-indent-function'.</p>
