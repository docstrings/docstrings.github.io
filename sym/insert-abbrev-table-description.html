<h3>Function: insert-abbrev-table-description</h3>
<p>
Insert before point a full description of abbrev table named NAME.
NAME is a symbol whose value is an abbrev table.
If optional 2nd arg READABLE is non-nil, a human-readable description
is inserted.  Otherwise the description is an expression,
a call to `define-abbrev-table', which would
define the abbrev table NAME exactly as it is currently defined.</p>

Abbrevs marked as "system abbrevs" are omitted.</p>
