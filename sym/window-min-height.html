<h3>Variable: window-min-height</h3>
<p>
The minimum number of lines of any window.<br>
The value has to accommodate a mode- or header-line if present.<br>
A value less than `window-safe-min-height' is ignored.  The value<br>
of this variable is honored when windows are resized or split.<br>
<br>
Applications should never rebind this variable.  To resize a<br>
window to a height less than the one specified here, an<br>
application should instead call `window-resize' with a non-nil<br>
IGNORE argument.  In order to have `split-window' make a window<br>
shorter, explicitly specify the SIZE argument of that function.</p>
