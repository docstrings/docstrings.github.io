<h3>Function: checkdoc-eval-defun</h3>
<p>
Evaluate the current form with `eval-defun' and check its documentation.<br>
Evaluation is done first so the form will be read before the<br>
documentation is checked.  If there is a documentation error, then the display<br>
of what was evaluated will be overwritten by the diagnostic message.
