<h3>Function: process-file</h3>
<p>
Process files synchronously in a separate process.
Similar to `call-process', but may invoke a file handler based on
`default-directory'.  The current working directory of the
subprocess is `default-directory'.</p>
<p>
File names in INFILE and BUFFER are handled normally, but file
names in ARGS should be relative to `default-directory', as they
are passed to the process verbatim.  (This is a difference to
`call-process' which does not support file handlers for INFILE
and BUFFER.)</p>
<p>
Some file handlers might not support all variants, for example
they might behave as if DISPLAY was nil, regardless of the actual
value passed.</p>
