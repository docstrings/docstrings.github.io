<h3>Function: process-file</h3>
<p>
Process files synchronously in a separate process.<br>
Similar to `call-process', but may invoke a file handler based on<br>
`default-directory'.  The current working directory of the<br>
subprocess is `default-directory'.<br>
<br>
File names in INFILE and BUFFER are handled normally, but file<br>
names in ARGS should be relative to `default-directory', as they<br>
are passed to the process verbatim.  (This is a difference to<br>
`call-process' which does not support file handlers for INFILE<br>
and BUFFER.)<br>
<br>
Some file handlers might not support all variants, for example<br>
they might behave as if DISPLAY was nil, regardless of the actual
value passed.</p>
