<h3>Function: set-mouse-position</h3>
<p>
Move the mouse pointer to the center of character cell (X,Y) in FRAME.
Coordinates are relative to the frame, not a window,
so the coordinates of the top left character in the frame
may be nonzero due to left-hand scroll bars or the menu bar.</p>
<p>
The position is given in character cells, where (0, 0) is the
upper-left corner of the frame, X is the horizontal offset, and Y is
the vertical offset.</p>
<p>
This function is a no-op for an X frame that is not visible.
If you have just created a frame, you must wait for it to become visible
before calling this function on it, like this.
  (while (not (frame-visible-p frame)) (sleep-for .5))</p>
<p>
(fn FRAME X Y)</p>
