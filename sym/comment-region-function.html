<h3>Variable: comment-region-function</h3>
<p>
Function to comment a region.<br>
Its args are the same as those of `comment-region', but BEG and END are<br>
guaranteed to be correctly ordered.  It is called within `save-excursion'.<br>
<br>
Applicable at least in modes for languages like fixed-format Fortran where<br>
comments always start in column zero.</p>
