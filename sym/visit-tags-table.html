<h3>Function: visit-tags-table</h3>
<p>
Tell tags commands to use tags table file FILE.<br>
FILE should be the name of a file created with the `etags' program.<br>
A directory name is ok too; it means file TAGS in that directory.<br>
<br>
Normally M-x visit-tags-table sets the global value of `tags-file-name'.<br>
With a prefix arg, set the buffer-local value instead.<br>
When you find a tag with M-., the buffer it finds the tag<br>
in is given a local value of this variable which is the name of the tags<br>
file the tag was in.

(fn FILE &optional LOCAL)</p>
