<h3>Variable: font-lock-syntactic-face-function</h3>
<p>
Function to determine which face to use when fontifying syntactically.
The function is called with a single parameter (the state as returned by
`parse-partial-sexp' at the beginning of the region to highlight) and
should return a face.  This is normally set via `font-lock-defaults'.</p>
