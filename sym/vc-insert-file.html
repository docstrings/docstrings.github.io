<h3>Function: vc-insert-file</h3>
<p>
Insert the contents of FILE into the current buffer.</p>
<p>
Optional argument LIMIT is a regexp.  If present, the file is inserted
in chunks of size BLOCKSIZE (default 8 kByte), until the first
occurrence of LIMIT is found.  Anything from the start of that occurrence
to the end of the buffer is then deleted.  The function returns
non-nil if FILE exists and its contents were successfully inserted.</p>
