<h3>Function: compilation-shell-minor-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle Compilation Shell minor mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Compilation Shell minor mode
if ARG is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from
Lisp, enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.</p>
<p>
When Compilation Shell minor mode is enabled, all the
error-parsing commands of the Compilation major mode are
available but bound to keys that don't collide with Shell mode.
See `compilation-mode'.</p>
