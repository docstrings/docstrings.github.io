<h3>Variable: rmail-user-mail-address-regexp</h3>
<p>
Regexp matching user mail addresses.
If non-nil, this variable is used to identify the correspondent
when receiving new mail.  If it matches the address of the sender,
the recipient is taken as correspondent of a mail.
If nil (default value), your `user-login-name' and `user-mail-address'
are used to exclude yourself as correspondent.</p>
<p>
Usually you don't have to set this variable, except if you collect mails
sent by you under different user names.
Then it should be a regexp matching your mail addresses.</p>
<p>
Setting this variable has an effect only before reading a mail.</p>
