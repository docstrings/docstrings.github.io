<h3>Variable: special-display-buffer-names</h3>
<p>
List of names of buffers that should be displayed specially.
Displaying a buffer with `display-buffer' or `pop-to-buffer', if
its name is in this list, displays the buffer in a way specified
by `special-display-function'.  `special-display-popup-frame'
(the default for `special-display-function') usually displays
the buffer in a separate frame made with the parameters specified
by `special-display-frame-alist'.  If `special-display-function'
has been set to some other function, that function is called with
the buffer as first, and nil as second argument.</p>
<p>
Alternatively, an element of this list can be specified as
(BUFFER-NAME FRAME-PARAMETERS), where BUFFER-NAME is a buffer
name and FRAME-PARAMETERS an alist of (PARAMETER . VALUE) pairs.
`special-display-popup-frame' will interpret such pairs as frame
parameters when it creates a special frame, overriding the
corresponding values from `special-display-frame-alist'.</p>
<p>
As a special case, if FRAME-PARAMETERS contains (same-window . t)
`special-display-popup-frame' displays that buffer in the
selected window.  If FRAME-PARAMETERS contains (same-frame . t),
it displays that buffer in a window on the selected frame.</p>
<p>
If `special-display-function' specifies some other function than
`special-display-popup-frame', that function is called with the
buffer named BUFFER-NAME as first, and FRAME-PARAMETERS as second
argument.</p>
<p>
Finally, an element of this list can be also specified as
(BUFFER-NAME FUNCTION OTHER-ARGS).  In that case,
`special-display-popup-frame' will call FUNCTION with the buffer
named BUFFER-NAME as first argument, and OTHER-ARGS as the
second.</p>
<p>
Any alternative function specified here is responsible for
setting up the quit-restore parameter of the window used.</p>
<p>
If this variable appears "not to work", because you added a
name to it but the corresponding buffer is displayed in the
selected window, look at the values of `same-window-buffer-names'
and `same-window-regexps'.  Those variables take precedence over
this one.</p>
