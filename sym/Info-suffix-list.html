<h3>Variable: Info-suffix-list</h3>
<p>
List of file name suffixes and associated decoding commands.<br>
Each entry should be (SUFFIX . STRING); the file is given to<br>
the command as standard input.<br>
<br>
STRING may be a list of strings.  In that case, the first element is<br>
the command name, and the rest are arguments to that command.<br>
<br>
If STRING is nil, no decoding is done.<br>
Because the SUFFIXes are tried in order, the empty string should
be last in the list.</p>
