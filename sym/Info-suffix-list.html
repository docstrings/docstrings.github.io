<h3>Variable: Info-suffix-list</h3>
<p>
List of file name suffixes and associated decoding commands.
Each entry should be (SUFFIX . STRING); the file is given to
the command as standard input.</p>
<p>
STRING may be a list of strings.  In that case, the first element is
the command name, and the rest are arguments to that command.</p>
<p>
If STRING is nil, no decoding is done.
Because the SUFFIXes are tried in order, the empty string should
be last in the list.</p>
