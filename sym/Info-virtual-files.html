<h3>Variable: Info-virtual-files</h3>
<p>
List of definitions of virtual Info files.<br>
Each element of the list has the format (FILENAME (OPERATION . HANDLER) ...)<br>
where FILENAME is a regexp that matches a class of virtual Info file names.<br>
It should be carefully chosen to not cause file name clashes with<br>
existing file names.  OPERATION is one of the following operation<br>
symbols `find-file', `find-node', `toc-nodes' that define what HANDLER<br>
function to call instead of calling the default corresponding function
to override it.</p>
