<h3>Variable: Info-virtual-files</h3>
<p>
List of definitions of virtual Info files.
Each element of the list has the format (FILENAME (OPERATION . HANDLER) ...)
where FILENAME is a regexp that matches a class of virtual Info file names.
It should be carefully chosen to not cause file name clashes with
existing file names.  OPERATION is one of the following operation
symbols `find-file', `find-node', `toc-nodes' that define what HANDLER
function to call instead of calling the default corresponding function
to override it.</p>
