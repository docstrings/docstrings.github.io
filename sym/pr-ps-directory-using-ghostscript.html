<h3>Function: pr-ps-directory-using-ghostscript</h3>
<p>
Print directory using PostScript through ghostscript.</p>
<p>
Interactively, the command prompts for N-UP printing number, a directory, a
file name regexp for matching and, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the
command prompts the user for a file name, and saves the PostScript image in
that file instead of saving it in a temporary file.</p>
<p>
Noninteractively, if N-UP is nil, prompts for N-UP printing number.  If DIR is
nil, prompts for DIRectory.  If FILE-REGEXP is nil, prompts for
FILE(name)-REGEXP.  The argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it's nil,
save the image in a temporary file.  If FILENAME is a string, save the
PostScript image in a file with that name.  If FILENAME is t, prompts for a
file name.</p>
