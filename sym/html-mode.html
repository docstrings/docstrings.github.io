<h3>Function: html-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode based on SGML mode for editing HTML documents.<br>
This allows inserting skeleton constructs used in hypertext documents with<br>
completion.  See below for an introduction to HTML.  Use<br>
C-c C-v to see how this comes out.  See also `sgml-mode' on<br>
which this is based.<br>
<br>
Do C-h v html- SPC and C-h v sgml- SPC to see available variables.<br>
<br>
To write fairly well formatted pages you only need to know few things.  Most<br>
browsers have a function to read the source code of the page being seen, so<br>
you can imitate various tricks.  Here's a very short HTML primer which you<br>
can also view with a browser to see what happens:<br>
<br>
<title>A Title Describing Contents</title> should be on every page.  Pages can<br>
have <h1>Very Major Headlines</h1> through <h6>Very Minor Headlines</h6><br>
<hr> Parts can be separated with horizontal rules.<br>
<br>
<p>Paragraphs only need an opening tag.  Line breaks and multiple spaces are<br>
ignored unless the text is <pre>preformatted.</pre>  Text can be marked as<br>
<b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i> or <u>underlined</u> using the normal M-o or<br>
Edit/Text Properties/Face commands.<br>
<br>
Pages can have <a name="SOMENAME">named points</a> and can link other points<br>
to them with <a href="#SOMENAME">see also somename</a>.  In the same way <a<br>
href="URL">see also URL</a> where URL is a filename relative to current<br>
directory, or absolute as in `http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html'.<br>
<br>
Images in many formats can be inlined with <img src="URL">.<br>
<br>
If you mainly create your own documents, `sgml-specials' might be<br>
interesting.  But note that some HTML 2 browsers can't handle `&apos;'.<br>
To work around that, do:<br>
   (eval-after-load "sgml-mode" '(aset sgml-char-names ?' nil))<br>
<br>
key             binding<br>

In addition to any hooks its parent mode might have run,
this mode runs the hook `html-mode-hook', as the final step
during initialization.</p>
