<h3>Function: html-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode based on SGML mode for editing HTML documents.
This allows inserting skeleton constructs used in hypertext documents with
completion.  See below for an introduction to HTML.  Use
C-c C-v to see how this comes out.  See also `sgml-mode' on
which this is based.</p>
<p>
Do C-h v html- SPC and C-h v sgml- SPC to see available variables.</p>
<p>
To write fairly well formatted pages you only need to know few things.  Most
browsers have a function to read the source code of the page being seen, so
you can imitate various tricks.  Here's a very short HTML primer which you
can also view with a browser to see what happens:</p>
<p>
<title>A Title Describing Contents</title> should be on every page.  Pages can
have <h1>Very Major Headlines</h1> through <h6>Very Minor Headlines</h6>
<hr> Parts can be separated with horizontal rules.</p>
<p>
<p>Paragraphs only need an opening tag.  Line breaks and multiple spaces are
ignored unless the text is <pre>preformatted.</pre>  Text can be marked as
<b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i> or <u>underlined</u> using the normal M-o or
Edit/Text Properties/Face commands.</p>
<p>
Pages can have <a name="SOMENAME">named points</a> and can link other points
to them with <a href="#SOMENAME">see also somename</a>.  In the same way <a
href="URL">see also URL</a> where URL is a filename relative to current
directory, or absolute as in `http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html'.</p>
<p>
Images in many formats can be inlined with <img src="URL">.</p>
<p>
If you mainly create your own documents, `sgml-specials' might be
interesting.  But note that some HTML 2 browsers can't handle `&apos;'.
To work around that, do:
   (eval-after-load "sgml-mode" '(aset sgml-char-names ?' nil))</p>
<p>
key             binding
---             -------</p>

In addition to any hooks its parent mode might have run,
this mode runs the hook `html-mode-hook', as the final step
during initialization.</p>
