<h3>Variable: sentence-end-without-period</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means a sentence will end without a period.<br>
For example, a sentence in Thai text ends with double space but<br>
without a period.<br>
<br>
This value is used by the function `sentence-end' to construct the<br>
regexp describing the end of a sentence, when the value of the variable<br>
`sentence-end' is nil.  See Info node `(elisp)Standard Regexps'.</p>
