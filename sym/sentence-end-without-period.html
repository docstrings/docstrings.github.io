<h3>Variable: sentence-end-without-period</h3>

Non-nil means a sentence will end without a period.

without a period.</p>

This value is used by the function `sentence-end' to construct the
regexp describing the end of a sentence, when the value of the variable
`sentence-end' is nil.  See Info node `(elisp)Standard Regexps'.</p>
