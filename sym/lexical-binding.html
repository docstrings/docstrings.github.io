<h3>Variable: lexical-binding</h3>
<p>
Whether to use lexical binding when evaluating code.<br>
Non-nil means that the code in the current buffer should be evaluated<br>
with lexical binding.<br>
This variable is automatically set from the file variables of an<br>
interpreted Lisp file read using `load'.  Unlike other file local<br>
variables, this must be set in the first line of a file.</p>
