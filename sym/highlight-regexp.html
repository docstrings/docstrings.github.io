<h3>Function: highlight-regexp</h3>
<p>
Set face of each match of REGEXP to FACE.
Interactively, prompt for REGEXP then FACE, using a buffer-local
history list for REGEXP and a global history list for FACE.</p>
<p>
If Font Lock mode is enabled in the buffer, it is used to
highlight REGEXP.  If Font Lock mode is disabled, overlays are
used for highlighting; in this case, the highlighting will not be
updated as you type.</p>
