<h3>Function: kill-whole-line</h3>
<p>
Kill current line.<br>
With prefix ARG, kill that many lines starting from the current line.<br>
If ARG is negative, kill backward.  Also kill the preceding newline.<br>
(This is meant to make C-x z work well with negative arguments.)<br>
If ARG is zero, kill current line but exclude the trailing newline.</p>
<h3>Variable: kill-whole-line</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, `kill-line' with no arg at start of line kills the whole line.</p>
