<h3>Variable: comment-column</h3>
<p>
Column to indent right-margin comments to.
Each mode may establish a different default value for this variable; you
can set the value for a particular mode using that mode's hook.
Comments might be indented to a different value in order not to go beyond
`comment-fill-column' or in order to align them with surrounding comments.</p>
