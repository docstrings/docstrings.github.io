<h3>Function: find-face-definition</h3>
<p>
Find the definition of FACE.  FACE defaults to the name near point.</p>
<p>
Finds the Emacs Lisp library containing the definition of the face
near point (selected by `variable-at-point') in a buffer and
places point before the definition.</p>
<p>
Set mark before moving, if the buffer already existed.</p>
<p>
The library where FACE is defined is searched for in
`find-function-source-path', if non-nil, otherwise in `load-path'.
