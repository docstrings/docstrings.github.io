<h3>Function: font-lock-extend-jit-lock-region-after-change</h3>
<p>
Function meant for `jit-lock-after-change-extend-region-functions'.
This function does 2 things:
- extend the region so that it not only includes the part that was modified
  but also the surrounding text whose highlighting may change as a consequence.
- anticipate (part of) the region extension that will happen later in
  `font-lock-default-fontify-region', in order to avoid the need for
  double-redisplay in `jit-lock-fontify-now'.</p>
