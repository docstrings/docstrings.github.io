<h3>Function: pkg-info-defining-library-original-version</h3>
<p>
Get the original version of the library defining FUNCTION.<br>
<br>
The original version is stored in the X-Original-Version header.<br>
This header is added by the MELPA package archive to preserve<br>
upstream version numbers.<br>
<br>
If SHOW is non-nil, show the version in mini-buffer.<br>
<br>
This function is mainly intended to find the version of a major<br>
or minor mode, i.e.<br>
<br>
   (pkg-info-defining-library-version 'flycheck-mode)<br>
<br>
Return the version of the library defining FUNCTION.  Signal an<br>
error if FUNCTION is not a valid function, if its defining<br>
library was not found, or if the library had no proper version
header.
