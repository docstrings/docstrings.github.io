<h3>Function: rmail-output</h3>
<p>
Append this message to mail file FILE-NAME.<br>
Writes mbox format, unless FILE-NAME exists and is Babyl format, in which<br>
case it writes Babyl.<br>
<br>
Interactively, the default file name comes from `rmail-default-file',<br>
which is updated to the name you use in this command.  In all uses, if<br>
FILE-NAME is not absolute, it is expanded with the directory part of<br>
`rmail-default-file'.<br>
<br>
If a buffer is visiting FILE-NAME, adds the text to that buffer<br>
rather than saving the file directly.  If the buffer is an Rmail<br>
buffer, updates it accordingly.<br>
<br>
This command always outputs the complete message header, even if<br>
the header display is currently pruned.<br>
<br>
Optional prefix argument COUNT (default 1) says to output that<br>
many consecutive messages, starting with the current one (ignoring<br>
deleted messages).  If `rmail-delete-after-output' is non-nil, deletes<br>
messages after output.<br>
<br>
The optional third argument NOATTRIBUTE, if non-nil, says not to<br>
set the `filed' attribute, and not to display a "Wrote file"<br>
message (if writing a file directly).<br>
<br>
Set the optional fourth argument NOT-RMAIL non-nil if you call this<br>
from a non-Rmail buffer.  In this case, COUNT is ignored.
