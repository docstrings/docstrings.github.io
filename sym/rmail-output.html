<h3>Function: rmail-output</h3>
<p>
Append this message to mail file FILE-NAME.
Writes mbox format, unless FILE-NAME exists and is Babyl format, in which
case it writes Babyl.</p>
<p>
Interactively, the default file name comes from `rmail-default-file',
which is updated to the name you use in this command.  In all uses, if
FILE-NAME is not absolute, it is expanded with the directory part of
`rmail-default-file'.</p>
<p>
If a buffer is visiting FILE-NAME, adds the text to that buffer
rather than saving the file directly.  If the buffer is an Rmail
buffer, updates it accordingly.</p>
<p>
This command always outputs the complete message header, even if
the header display is currently pruned.</p>
<p>
Optional prefix argument COUNT (default 1) says to output that
many consecutive messages, starting with the current one (ignoring
deleted messages).  If `rmail-delete-after-output' is non-nil, deletes
messages after output.</p>
<p>
The optional third argument NOATTRIBUTE, if non-nil, says not to
set the `filed' attribute, and not to display a "Wrote file"
message (if writing a file directly).</p>
<p>
Set the optional fourth argument NOT-RMAIL non-nil if you call this
from a non-Rmail buffer.  In this case, COUNT is ignored.</p>
