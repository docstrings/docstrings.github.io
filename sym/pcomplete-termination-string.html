<h3>Variable: pcomplete-termination-string</h3>
<p>
A string that is inserted after any completion or expansion.
This is usually a space character, useful when completing lists of
words separated by spaces.  However, if your list uses a different
separator character, or if the completion occurs in a word that is
already terminated by a character, this variable should be locally
modified to be an empty string, or the desired separation string.</p>
