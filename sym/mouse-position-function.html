<h3>Variable: mouse-position-function</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, function to transform normal value of `mouse-position'.
`mouse-position' calls this function, passing its usual return value as
argument, and returns whatever this function returns.
This abnormal hook exists for the benefit of packages like `xt-mouse.el'
which need to do mouse handling at the Lisp level.</p>
