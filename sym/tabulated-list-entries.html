<h3>Variable: tabulated-list-entries</h3>
<p>
Entries displayed in the current Tabulated List buffer.
This should be either a function, or a list.
If a list, each element has the form (ID [DESC1 ... DESCN]),
where:
 - ID is nil, or a Lisp object uniquely identifying this entry,
   which is used to keep the cursor on the "same" entry when
   rearranging the list.  Comparison is done with `equal'.</p>
<p>
 - Each DESC is a column descriptor, one for each column
   specified in `tabulated-list-format'.  A descriptor is either
   a string, which is printed as-is, or a list (LABEL . PROPS),
   which means to use `insert-text-button' to insert a text
   button with label LABEL and button properties PROPS.
   The string, or button label, must not contain any newline.</p>
<p>
If `tabulated-list-entries' is a function, it is called with no
arguments and must return a list of the above form.</p>
