<h3>Variable: minor-mode-map-alist</h3>
<p>
Alist of keymaps to use for minor modes.<br>
Each element looks like (VARIABLE . KEYMAP); KEYMAP is used to read<br>
key sequences and look up bindings if VARIABLE's value is non-nil.<br>
If two active keymaps bind the same key, the keymap appearing earlier<br>
in the list takes precedence.</p>
