<h3>Variable: temp-buffer-show-function</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means call as function to display a help buffer.
The function is called with one argument, the buffer to be displayed.
Used by `with-output-to-temp-buffer'.
If this function is used, then it must do the entire job of showing
the buffer; `temp-buffer-show-hook' is not run unless this function runs it.</p>
