<h3>Function: string-width</h3>
<p>
Return width of STRING when displayed in the current buffer.<br>
Width is measured by how many columns it occupies on the screen.<br>
When calculating width of a multibyte character in STRING,<br>
only the base leading-code is considered; the validity of<br>
the following bytes is not checked.  Tabs in STRING are always<br>
taken to occupy `tab-width' columns.
