<h3>Function: syntax-ppss-toplevel-pos</h3>
<p>
Get the latest syntactically outermost position found in a syntactic scan.<br>
PPSS is a scan state, as returned by `parse-partial-sexp' or `syntax-ppss'.<br>
An "outermost position" means one that it is outside of any syntactic entity:<br>
outside of any parentheses, comments, or strings encountered in the scan.<br>
If no such position is recorded in PPSS (because the end of the scan was<br>
itself at the outermost level), return nil.
