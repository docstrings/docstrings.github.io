<h3>Function: idlwave-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for editing IDL source files (version 6.1_em22).<br>
<br>
The main features of this mode are<br>
<br>
1. Indentation and Formatting<br>
   --------------------------<br>
   Like other Emacs programming modes, C-j inserts a newline and indents.<br>
   TAB is used for explicit indentation of the current line.<br>
<br>
   To start a continuation line, use M-x idlwave-split-line.  This<br>
   function can also be used in the middle of a line to split the line<br>
   at that point.  When used inside a long constant string, the string<br>
   is split at that point with the `+' concatenation operator.<br>
<br>
   Comments are indented as follows:<br>
<br>
   `;;;' Indentation remains unchanged.<br>
   `;;'  Indent like the surrounding code<br>
   `;'   Indent to a minimum column.<br>
<br>
   The indentation of comments starting in column 0 is never changed.<br>
<br>
   Use M-x idlwave-fill-paragraph to refill a paragraph inside a<br>
   comment.  The indentation of the second line of the paragraph<br>
   relative to the first will be retained.  Use<br>
   M-x idlwave-auto-fill-mode to toggle auto-fill mode for these<br>
   comments.  When the variable `idlwave-fill-comment-line-only' is<br>
   nil, code can also be auto-filled and auto-indented.<br>
<br>
   To convert pre-existing IDL code to your formatting style, mark the<br>
   entire buffer with C-x h and execute<br>
   M-x idlwave-expand-region-abbrevs.  Then mark the entire buffer<br>
   again followed by C-M-\ (`indent-region').<br>
<br>
2. Routine Info<br>
   ------------<br>
   IDLWAVE displays information about the calling sequence and the<br>
   accepted keyword parameters of a procedure or function with<br>
   M-x idlwave-routine-info.  M-x idlwave-find-module jumps to the<br>
   source file of a module.  These commands know about system<br>
   routines, all routines in idlwave-mode buffers and (when the<br>
   idlwave-shell is active) about all modules currently compiled under<br>
   this shell.  It also makes use of pre-compiled or custom-scanned<br>
   user and library catalogs many popular libraries ship with by<br>
   default.  Use M-x idlwave-update-routine-info to update this<br>
   information, which is also used for completion (see item 4).<br>
<br>
3. Online IDL Help<br>
   ---------------<br>
<br>
   M-x idlwave-context-help displays the IDL documentation relevant<br>
   for the system variable, keyword, or routines at point.  A single<br>
   key stroke gets you directly to the right place in the docs.  See<br>
   the manual to configure where and how the HTML help is displayed.<br>
<br>
4. Completion<br>
   ----------<br>
   M-x idlwave-complete completes the names of procedures, functions<br>
   class names, keyword parameters, system variables and tags, class<br>
   tags, structure tags, filenames and much more.  It is context<br>
   sensitive and figures out what is expected at point.  Lower case<br>
   strings are completed in lower case, other strings in mixed or<br>
   upper case.<br>
<br>
5. Code Templates and Abbreviations<br>
   --------------------------------<br>
   Many Abbreviations are predefined to expand to code fragments and templates.<br>
   The abbreviations start generally with a `\`.  Some examples:<br>
<br>
   \pr        PROCEDURE template<br>
   \fu        FUNCTION template<br>
   \c         CASE statement template<br>
   \sw        SWITCH statement template<br>
   \f         FOR loop template<br>
   \r         REPEAT Loop template<br>
   \w         WHILE loop template<br>
   \i         IF statement template<br>
   \elif      IF-ELSE statement template<br>
   \b         BEGIN<br>
<br>
   For a full list, use M-x idlwave-list-abbrevs.  Some templates also<br>
   have direct keybindings - see the list of keybindings below.<br>
<br>
   M-x idlwave-doc-header inserts a documentation header at the<br>
   beginning of the current program unit (pro, function or main).<br>
   Change log entries can be added to the current program unit with<br>
   M-x idlwave-doc-modification.<br>
<br>
6. Automatic Case Conversion<br>
   -------------------------<br>
   The case of reserved words and some abbrevs is controlled by<br>
   `idlwave-reserved-word-upcase' and `idlwave-abbrev-change-case'.<br>
<br>
7. Automatic END completion<br>
   ------------------------<br>
   If the variable `idlwave-expand-generic-end' is non-nil, each END typed<br>
   will be converted to the specific version, like ENDIF, ENDFOR, etc.<br>
<br>
8. Hooks<br>
   -----<br>
   Loading idlwave.el runs `idlwave-load-hook'.<br>
   Turning on `idlwave-mode' runs `idlwave-mode-hook'.<br>
<br>
9. Documentation and Customization<br>
   -------------------------------<br>
   Info documentation for this package is available.  Use<br>
   M-x idlwave-info to display (complain to your sysadmin if that does<br>
   not work).  For Postscript, PDF, and HTML versions of the
   documentation, check IDLWAVE's homepage at URL `http://idlwave.org'.
   IDLWAVE has customize support - see the group `idlwave'.

10.Keybindings
   -----------
   Here is a list of all keybindings of this mode.
   If some of the key bindings below show with ??, use C-h k
   followed by the key sequence to see what the key sequence does.


Uses keymap `idlwave-mode-map', which is not currently defined.
