<h3>Function: current-word</h3>
<p>
Return the symbol or word that point is on (or a nearby one) as a string.
The return value includes no text properties.
If optional arg STRICT is non-nil, return nil unless point is within
or adjacent to a symbol or word.  In all cases the value can be nil
if there is no word nearby.
The function, belying its name, normally finds a symbol.
If optional arg REALLY-WORD is non-nil, it finds just a word.</p>
