<h3>Variable: epa-file-name-regexp</h3>
<p>
Regexp which matches filenames to be encrypted with GnuPG.<br>
<br>
If you set this outside Custom while epa-file is already enabled, you<br>
have to call `epa-file-name-regexp-update' after setting it to<br>
properly update file-name-handler-alist.  Setting this through Custom<br>
does that automatically.</p>
