<h3>Variable: epa-file-name-regexp</h3>
<p>
Regexp which matches filenames to be encrypted with GnuPG.</p>
<p>
If you set this outside Custom while epa-file is already enabled, you
have to call `epa-file-name-regexp-update' after setting it to
properly update file-name-handler-alist.  Setting this through Custom
does that automatically.</p>
