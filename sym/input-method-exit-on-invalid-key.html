<h3>Variable: input-method-exit-on-invalid-key</h3>
<p>
This flag controls the behavior of an input method on invalid key input.
Usually, when a user types a key which doesn't start any character
handled by the input method, the key is handled by turning off the
input method temporarily.  After that key, the input method is re-enabled.
But, if this flag is non-nil, the input method is never back on.</p>
