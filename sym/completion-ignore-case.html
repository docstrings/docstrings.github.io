<h3>Variable: completion-ignore-case</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means don't consider case significant in completion.
For file-name completion, `read-file-name-completion-ignore-case'
controls the behavior, rather than this variable.
For buffer name completion, `read-buffer-completion-ignore-case'
controls the behavior, rather than this variable.</p>
