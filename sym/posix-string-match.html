<h3>Function: posix-string-match</h3>
<p>
Return index of start of first match for REGEXP in STRING, or nil.<br>
Find the longest match, in accord with Posix regular expression rules.<br>
Case is ignored if `case-fold-search' is non-nil in the current buffer.<br>
If third arg START is non-nil, start search at that index in STRING.<br>
For index of first char beyond the match, do (match-end 0).<br>
`match-end' and `match-beginning' also give indices of substrings<br>
matched by parenthesis constructs in the pattern.<br>
<br>
(fn REGEXP STRING &optional START)</p>
