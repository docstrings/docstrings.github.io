<h3>Function: facemenu-active-faces</h3>
<p>
Return from FACE-LIST those faces that would be used for display.
This means each face attribute is not specified in a face earlier in FACE-LIST
and such a face is therefore active when used to display text.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, use the faces in that frame; otherwise
use the selected frame.  If t, then the global, non-frame faces are used.</p>
