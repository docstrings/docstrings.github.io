<h3>Variable: font-lock-multiline</h3>
<p>
Whether font-lock should cater to multiline keywords.
If nil, don't try to handle multiline patterns.
If t, always handle multiline patterns.
If `undecided', don't try to handle multiline patterns until you see one.
Major/minor modes can set this variable if they know which option applies.</p>
