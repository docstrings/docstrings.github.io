<h3>Function: end-of-line</h3>
<p>
Move point to end of current line (in the logical order).<br>
With argument N not nil or 1, move forward N - 1 lines first.<br>
If point reaches the beginning or end of buffer, it stops there.<br>
To ignore intangibility, bind `inhibit-point-motion-hooks' to t.<br>
<br>
This function constrains point to the current field unless this moves<br>
point to a different line than the original, unconstrained result.  If<br>
N is nil or 1, and a rear-sticky field ends at point, the point does<br>
not move.  To ignore field boundaries bind `inhibit-field-text-motion'
to t.
