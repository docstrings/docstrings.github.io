<h3>Function: end-of-line</h3>
<p>
Move point to end of current line (in the logical order).
With argument N not nil or 1, move forward N - 1 lines first.
If point reaches the beginning or end of buffer, it stops there.
To ignore intangibility, bind `inhibit-point-motion-hooks' to t.</p>
<p>
This function constrains point to the current field unless this moves
point to a different line than the original, unconstrained result.  If
N is nil or 1, and a rear-sticky field ends at point, the point does
not move.  To ignore field boundaries bind `inhibit-field-text-motion'
to t.</p>
