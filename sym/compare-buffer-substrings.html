<h3>Function: compare-buffer-substrings</h3>
<p>
Compare two substrings of two buffers; return result as number.
Return -N if first string is less after N-1 chars, +N if first string is
greater after N-1 chars, or 0 if strings match.  Each substring is
represented as three arguments: BUFFER, START and END.  That makes six
args in all, three for each substring.</p>
<p>
The value of `case-fold-search' in the current buffer
determines whether case is significant or ignored.</p>

(fn BUFFER1 START1 END1 BUFFER2 START2 END2)</p>
