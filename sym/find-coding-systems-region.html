<h3>Function: find-coding-systems-region</h3>
<p>
Return a list of proper coding systems to encode a text between FROM and TO.</p>
<p>
If FROM is a string, find coding systems in that instead of the buffer.
All coding systems in the list can safely encode any multibyte characters
in the text.</p>
<p>
If the text contains no multibyte characters, return a list of a single
element `undecided'.</p>
