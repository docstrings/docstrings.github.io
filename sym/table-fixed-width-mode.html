<h3>Function: table-fixed-width-mode</h3>
<p>
Cell width is fixed when this is non-nil.
Normally it should be nil for allowing automatic cell width expansion
that widens a cell when it is necessary.  When non-nil, typing in a
cell does not automatically expand the cell width.  A word that is too
long to fit in a cell is chopped into multiple lines.  The chopped
location is indicated by `table-word-continuation-char'.  This
variable's value can be toggled by M-x table-fixed-width-mode at
run-time.</p>
