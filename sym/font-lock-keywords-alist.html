<h3>Variable: font-lock-keywords-alist</h3>
<p>
Alist of additional `font-lock-keywords' elements for major modes.</p>
<p>
Each element has the form (MODE KEYWORDS . HOW).
`font-lock-set-defaults' adds the elements in the list KEYWORDS to
`font-lock-keywords' when Font Lock is turned on in major mode MODE.</p>
<p>
If HOW is nil, KEYWORDS are added at the beginning of
`font-lock-keywords'.  If it is `set', they are used to replace the
value of `font-lock-keywords'.  If HOW is any other non-nil value,
they are added at the end.</p>
<p>
This is normally set via `font-lock-add-keywords' and
`font-lock-remove-keywords'.</p>
