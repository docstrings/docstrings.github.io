<h3>Variable: font-lock-keywords-alist</h3>
<p>
Alist of additional `font-lock-keywords' elements for major modes.<br>
<br>
Each element has the form (MODE KEYWORDS . HOW).<br>
`font-lock-set-defaults' adds the elements in the list KEYWORDS to<br>
`font-lock-keywords' when Font Lock is turned on in major mode MODE.<br>
<br>
If HOW is nil, KEYWORDS are added at the beginning of<br>
`font-lock-keywords'.  If it is `set', they are used to replace the<br>
value of `font-lock-keywords'.  If HOW is any other non-nil value,<br>
they are added at the end.<br>
<br>
This is normally set via `font-lock-add-keywords' and
`font-lock-remove-keywords'.</p>
