<h3>Function: smie-precs->prec2</h3>
<p>
Compute a 2D precedence table from a list of precedences.<br>
PRECS should be a list, sorted by precedence (e.g. "+" will<br>
come before "*"), of elements of the form (left OP ...)<br>
or (right OP ...) or (nonassoc OP ...) or (assoc OP ...).  All operators in<br>
one of those elements share the same precedence level and associativity.
