<h3>Function: shadow-define-cluster</h3>
<p>
Edit (or create) the definition of a cluster NAME.
This is a group of hosts that share directories, so that copying to or from
one of them is sufficient to update the file on all of them.  Clusters are
defined by a name, the network address of a primary host (the one we copy
files to), and a regular expression that matches the hostnames of all the
sites in the cluster.</p>
