<h3>Function: parse-partial-sexp</h3>
<p>
Parse Lisp syntax starting at FROM until TO; return status of parse at TO.
Parsing stops at TO or when certain criteria are met;
 point is set to where parsing stops.
If fifth arg OLDSTATE is omitted or nil,
 parsing assumes that FROM is the beginning of a function.
Value is a list of elements describing final state of parsing:
 0. depth in parens.
 1. character address of start of innermost containing list; nil if none.
 2. character address of start of last complete sexp terminated.
 3. non-nil if inside a string.
    (it is the character that will terminate the string,
     or t if the string should be terminated by a generic string delimiter.)
 4. nil if outside a comment, t if inside a non-nestable comment,
    else an integer (the current comment nesting).
 5. t if following a quote character.
 6. the minimum paren-depth encountered during this scan.
 7. style of comment, if any.
 8. character address of start of comment or string; nil if not in one.
 9. Intermediate data for continuation of parsing (subject to change).
If third arg TARGETDEPTH is non-nil, parsing stops if the depth
in parentheses becomes equal to TARGETDEPTH.
Fourth arg STOPBEFORE non-nil means stop when come to
 any character that starts a sexp.
Fifth arg OLDSTATE is a list like what this function returns.
 It is used to initialize the state of the parse.  Elements number 1, 2, 6
 are ignored.
Sixth arg COMMENTSTOP non-nil means stop at the start of a comment.
 If it is symbol `syntax-table', stop after the start of a comment or a
 string, or after end of a comment or a string.</p>
