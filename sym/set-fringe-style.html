<h3>Function: set-fringe-style</h3>
<p>
Set the default appearance of fringes on the selected frame.
When called interactively, query the user for MODE; valid values
are `no-fringes', `default', `left-only', `right-only', `minimal'
and `half-width'.  See `fringe-styles'.</p>
<p>
When used in a Lisp program, MODE should be one of these:
- nil, which means the default width (8 pixels).
- a cons cell (LEFT . RIGHT), where LEFT and RIGHT are
  respectively the left and right fringe widths in pixels, or
  nil (meaning to disable that fringe).
- a single integer, which specifies the pixel widths of both
  fringes.
This command may round up the left and right width specifications
to ensure that their sum is a multiple of the character width of
a frame.  It never rounds up a fringe width of 0.</p>
<p>
Fringe widths set by `set-window-fringes' override the default
fringe widths set by this command.  If you want to set the
default appearance of fringes on all frames, see the command
`fringe-mode'.</p>
