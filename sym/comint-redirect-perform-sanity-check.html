<h3>Variable: comint-redirect-perform-sanity-check</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, check that redirection is likely to complete successfully.
More precisely, before starting a redirection, verify that the
regular expression `comint-redirect-finished-regexp' that controls
when to terminate it actually matches some text already in the process
buffer.  The idea is that this regular expression should match a prompt
string, and that there ought to be at least one copy of your prompt string
in the process buffer already.</p>
