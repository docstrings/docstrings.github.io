<h3>Function: delq</h3>
<p>
Delete members of LIST which are `eq' to ELT, and return the result.
More precisely, this function skips any members `eq' to ELT at the
front of LIST, then removes members `eq' to ELT from the remaining
sublist by modifying its list structure, then returns the resulting
list.</p>
<p>
Write `(setq foo (delq element foo))' to be sure of correctly changing
the value of a list `foo'.</p>
<p>
(fn ELT LIST)</p>
