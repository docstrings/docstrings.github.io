<h3>Variable: comment-styles</h3>
<p>
Comment region style definitions.
Each style is defined with a form (STYLE . (MULTI ALIGN EXTRA INDENT DOC)).
DOC should succinctly describe the style.
STYLE should be a mnemonic symbol.
MULTI specifies that comments are allowed to span multiple lines.
  e.g. in C it comments regions as
     /* blabla
      * bli */
  rather than
     /* blabla */
     /* bli */
  if `comment-end' is empty, this has no effect.</p>
<p>
ALIGN specifies that the `comment-end' markers should be aligned.
  e.g. in C it comments regions as
     /* blabla */
     /* bli    */
  rather than
     /* blabla */
     /* bli */
  if `comment-end' is empty, this has no effect, unless EXTRA is also set,
  in which case the comment gets wrapped in a box.</p>
<p>
EXTRA specifies that an extra line should be used before and after the
  region to comment (to put the `comment-end' and `comment-start').
  e.g. in C it comments regions as
     /*
      * blabla
      * bli
      */
  rather than
     /* blabla
      * bli */
  if the comment style is not multi line, this has no effect, unless ALIGN
  is also set, in which case the comment gets wrapped in a box.</p>
<p>
INDENT specifies that the `comment-start' markers should not be put at the
  left margin but at the current indentation of the region to comment.
If INDENT is `multi-char', that means indent multi-character
  comment starters, but not one-character comment starters.</p>
