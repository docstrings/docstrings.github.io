<h3>Variable: comment-styles</h3>
<p>
Comment region style definitions.<br>
Each style is defined with a form (STYLE . (MULTI ALIGN EXTRA INDENT DOC)).<br>
DOC should succinctly describe the style.<br>
STYLE should be a mnemonic symbol.<br>
MULTI specifies that comments are allowed to span multiple lines.<br>
  e.g. in C it comments regions as<br>
     /* blabla<br>
      * bli */<br>
  rather than<br>
     /* blabla */<br>
     /* bli */<br>
  if `comment-end' is empty, this has no effect.<br>
<br>
ALIGN specifies that the `comment-end' markers should be aligned.<br>
  e.g. in C it comments regions as<br>
     /* blabla */<br>
     /* bli    */<br>
  rather than<br>
     /* blabla */<br>
     /* bli */<br>
  if `comment-end' is empty, this has no effect, unless EXTRA is also set,<br>
  in which case the comment gets wrapped in a box.<br>
<br>
EXTRA specifies that an extra line should be used before and after the<br>
  region to comment (to put the `comment-end' and `comment-start').<br>
  e.g. in C it comments regions as<br>
     /*<br>
      * blabla<br>
      * bli<br>
      */<br>
  rather than<br>
     /* blabla<br>
      * bli */<br>
  if the comment style is not multi line, this has no effect, unless ALIGN<br>
  is also set, in which case the comment gets wrapped in a box.<br>
<br>
INDENT specifies that the `comment-start' markers should not be put at the<br>
  left margin but at the current indentation of the region to comment.
If INDENT is `multi-char', that means indent multi-character
  comment starters, but not one-character comment starters.</p>
