<h3>Function: toggle-scroll-bar</h3>
<p>
Toggle whether or not the selected frame has vertical scroll bars.
With arg, turn vertical scroll bars on if and only if arg is positive.
The variable `scroll-bar-mode' controls which side the scroll bars are on
when they are turned on; if it is nil, they go on the left.</p>
