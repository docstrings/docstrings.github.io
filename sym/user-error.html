<h3>Function: user-error</h3>
<p>
Signal a pilot error, making error message by passing all args to `format'.
In Emacs, the convention is that error messages start with a capital
letter but *do not* end with a period.  Please follow this convention
for the sake of consistency.
This is just like `error' except that `user-error's are expected to be the
result of an incorrect manipulation on the part of the user, rather than the
result of an actual problem.</p>
