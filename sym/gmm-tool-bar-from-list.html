<h3>Function: gmm-tool-bar-from-list</h3>
<p>
Make a tool bar from ICON-LIST.</p>
<p>
Within each entry of ICON-LIST, the first element is a menu
command, the second element is an icon file name and the third
element is a test function.  You can use C-h k
<menu-entry> to find out the name of a menu command.  The fourth
and all following elements are passed as the PROPS argument to the
function `tool-bar-local-item'.</p>
<p>
If ZAP-LIST is a list, remove those item from the default
`tool-bar-map'.  If it is t, start with a new sparse map.  You
can use C-h k <icon> to find out the name of an icon
item.  When C-h k <icon> shows "<tool-bar> <new-file>
runs the command find-file", then use `new-file' in ZAP-LIST.</p>
<p>
DEFAULT-MAP specifies the default key map for ICON-LIST.</p>

(fn ICON-LIST ZAP-LIST DEFAULT-MAP)</p>
