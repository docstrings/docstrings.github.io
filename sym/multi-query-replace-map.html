<h3>Variable: multi-query-replace-map</h3>
<p>
Keymap that defines additional bindings for multi-buffer replacements.
It extends its parent map `query-replace-map' with new bindings to
operate on a set of buffers/files.  The difference with its parent map
is the additional answers `automatic-all' to replace all remaining
matches in all remaining buffers with no more questions, and
`exit-current' to skip remaining matches in the current buffer
and to continue with the next buffer in the sequence.</p>
