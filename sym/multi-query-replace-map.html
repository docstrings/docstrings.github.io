<h3>Variable: multi-query-replace-map</h3>
<p>
Keymap that defines additional bindings for multi-buffer replacements.<br>
It extends its parent map `query-replace-map' with new bindings to<br>
operate on a set of buffers/files.  The difference with its parent map<br>
is the additional answers `automatic-all' to replace all remaining<br>
matches in all remaining buffers with no more questions, and<br>
`exit-current' to skip remaining matches in the current buffer<br>
and to continue with the next buffer in the sequence.</p>
