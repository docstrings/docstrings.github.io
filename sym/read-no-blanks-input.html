<h3>Function: read-no-blanks-input</h3>
<p>
Read a string from the terminal, not allowing blanks.<br>
Prompt with PROMPT.  Whitespace terminates the input.  If INITIAL is<br>
non-nil, it should be a string, which is used as initial input, with<br>
point positioned at the end, so that SPACE will accept the input.<br>
(Actually, INITIAL can also be a cons of a string and an integer.<br>
Such values are treated as in `read-from-minibuffer', but are normally<br>
not useful in this function.)<br>
Third arg INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD, if non-nil, means the minibuffer inherits<br>
the current input method and the setting of`enable-multibyte-characters'.<br>
