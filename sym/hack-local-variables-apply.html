<h3>Function: hack-local-variables-apply</h3>
<p>
Apply the elements of `file-local-variables-alist'.<br>
If there are any elements, runs `before-hack-local-variables-hook',<br>
then calls `hack-one-local-variable' to apply the alist elements one by one.<br>
Finishes by running `hack-local-variables-hook', regardless of whether<br>
the alist is empty or not.<br>
<br>
Note that this function ignores a `mode' entry if it specifies the same<br>
major mode as the buffer already has.</p>
