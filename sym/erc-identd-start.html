<h3>Function: erc-identd-start</h3>
<p>
Start an identd server listening to port 8113.<br>
Port 113 (auth) will need to be redirected to port 8113 on your<br>
machine -- using iptables, or a program like redir which can be<br>
run from inetd.  The idea is to provide a simple identd server<br>
when you need one, without having to install one globally on your<br>
system.<br>
