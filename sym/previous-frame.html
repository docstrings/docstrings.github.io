<h3>Function: previous-frame</h3>
<p>
Return the previous frame in the frame list before FRAME.
It considers only frames on the same terminal as FRAME.
By default, skip minibuffer-only frames.
If omitted, FRAME defaults to the selected frame.
If optional argument MINIFRAME is nil, exclude minibuffer-only frames.
If MINIFRAME is a window, include only its own frame
and any frame now using that window as the minibuffer.
If MINIFRAME is `visible', include all visible frames.
If MINIFRAME is 0, include all visible and iconified frames.
Otherwise, include all frames.</p>
