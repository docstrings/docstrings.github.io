<h3>Variable: load-source-file-function</h3>
<p>
Function called in `load' to load an Emacs Lisp source file.
The value should be a function for doing code conversion before
reading a source file.  It can also be nil, in which case loading is
done without any code conversion.</p>
<p>
If the value is a function, it is called with four arguments,
FULLNAME, FILE, NOERROR, NOMESSAGE.  FULLNAME is the absolute name of
the file to load, FILE is the non-absolute name (for messages etc.),
and NOERROR and NOMESSAGE are the corresponding arguments passed to
`load'.  The function should return t if the file was loaded.</p>
