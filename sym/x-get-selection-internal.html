<h3>Function: x-get-selection-internal</h3>
<p>
Return text selected from some X window.
SELECTION-SYMBOL is typically `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', or `CLIPBOARD'.
(Those are literal upper-case symbol names, since that's what X expects.)
TARGET-TYPE is the type of data desired, typically `STRING'.</p>
<p>
TIME-STAMP is the time to use in the XConvertSelection call for foreign
selections.  If omitted, defaults to the time for the last event.</p>
<p>
TERMINAL should be a terminal object or a frame specifying the X
server to query.  If omitted or nil, that stands for the selected
frame's display, or the first available X display.</p>
<p>
On Nextstep, TIME-STAMP and TERMINAL are unused.</p>
