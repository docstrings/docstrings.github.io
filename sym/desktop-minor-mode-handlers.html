<h3>Variable: desktop-minor-mode-handlers</h3>
<p>
Alist of functions to restore non-standard minor modes.
Functions are called by `desktop-create-buffer' to restore minor modes.
List elements must have the form</p>
<p>
   (MINOR-MODE . RESTORE-FUNCTION).</p>
<p>
Minor modes not specified here, are restored by the standard minor mode
function.</p>
<p>
Handlers are called with argument list</p>
<p>
   (DESKTOP-BUFFER-LOCALS)</p>
<p>
Furthermore, they may use the following variables:</p>
<p>
   desktop-file-version
   desktop-buffer-file-name
   desktop-buffer-name
   desktop-buffer-major-mode
   desktop-buffer-minor-modes
   desktop-buffer-point
   desktop-buffer-mark
   desktop-buffer-read-only
   desktop-buffer-misc</p>
<p>
When a handler is called, the buffer has been created and the major mode has
been set, but local variables listed in desktop-buffer-locals has not yet been
created and set.</p>
<p>
Modules that define a minor mode that needs a special handler should contain
code like</p>
<p>
   (defun foo-desktop-restore
   ...
   (add-to-list 'desktop-minor-mode-handlers
                '(foo-mode . foo-desktop-restore))</p>
<p>
Furthermore the minor mode function must be autoloaded.</p>
<p>
See also `desktop-minor-mode-table'.</p>
