<h3>Variable: desktop-minor-mode-handlers</h3>
<p>
Alist of functions to restore non-standard minor modes.<br>
Functions are called by `desktop-create-buffer' to restore minor modes.<br>
List elements must have the form<br>
<br>
   (MINOR-MODE . RESTORE-FUNCTION).<br>
<br>
Minor modes not specified here, are restored by the standard minor mode<br>
function.<br>
<br>
Handlers are called with argument list<br>
<br>
   (DESKTOP-BUFFER-LOCALS)<br>
<br>
Furthermore, they may use the following variables:<br>
<br>
   desktop-file-version<br>
   desktop-buffer-file-name<br>
   desktop-buffer-name<br>
   desktop-buffer-major-mode<br>
   desktop-buffer-minor-modes<br>
   desktop-buffer-point<br>
   desktop-buffer-mark<br>
   desktop-buffer-read-only<br>
   desktop-buffer-misc<br>
<br>
When a handler is called, the buffer has been created and the major mode has<br>
been set, but local variables listed in desktop-buffer-locals has not yet been<br>
created and set.<br>
<br>
Modules that define a minor mode that needs a special handler should contain<br>
code like<br>
<br>
   (defun foo-desktop-restore<br>
   ...<br>
   (add-to-list 'desktop-minor-mode-handlers<br>
                '(foo-mode . foo-desktop-restore))

Furthermore the minor mode function must be autoloaded.
