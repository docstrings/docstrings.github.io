<h3>Function: epa-sign-region</h3>
<p>
Sign the current region between START and END by SIGNERS keys selected.</p>
<p>
Don't use this command in Lisp programs!
Since this function operates on regions, it does some tricks such
as coding-system detection and unibyte/multibyte conversion.  If
you are sure how the data should be treated, you should consider
using the string based counterpart `epg-sign-string', or the file
based counterpart `epg-sign-file' instead.</p>
<p>
For example:</p>
<p>
(let ((context (epg-make-context 'OpenPGP)))
  (epg-sign-string
    context
    (encode-coding-string (buffer-substring start end) 'utf-8)))</p>
<p>
(fn START END SIGNERS MODE)</p>
