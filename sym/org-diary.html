<h3>Function: org-diary</h3>
<p>
Return diary information from org files.
This function can be used in a "sexp" diary entry in the Emacs calendar.
It accesses org files and extracts information from those files to be
listed in the diary.  The function accepts arguments specifying what
items should be listed.  For a list of arguments allowed here, see the
variable `org-agenda-entry-types'.</p>
<p>
The call in the diary file should look like this:</p>
<p>
   &%%(org-diary) ~/path/to/some/orgfile.org</p>
<p>
Use a separate line for each org file to check.  Or, if you omit the file name,
all files listed in `org-agenda-files' will be checked automatically:</p>
<p>
   &%%(org-diary)</p>
<p>
If you don't give any arguments (as in the example above), the default
arguments (:deadline :scheduled :timestamp :sexp) are used.
So the example above may also be written as</p>
<p>
   &%%(org-diary :deadline :timestamp :sexp :scheduled)</p>
<p>
The function expects the lisp variables `entry' and `date' to be provided
by the caller, because this is how the calendar works.  Don't use this
function from a program - use `org-agenda-get-day-entries' instead.</p>
