<h3>Function: gnus-group-split-fancy</h3>
<p>
Uses information from group parameters in order to split mail.
It can be embedded into `nnmail-split-fancy' lists with the SPLIT</p>
<p>
(: gnus-group-split-fancy GROUPS NO-CROSSPOST CATCH-ALL)</p>
<p>
GROUPS may be a regular expression or a list of group names, that will
be used to select candidate groups.  If it is omitted or nil, all
existing groups are considered.</p>
<p>
if NO-CROSSPOST is omitted or nil, a & split will be returned,
otherwise, a | split, that does not allow crossposting, will be
returned.</p>
<p>
For each selected group, a SPLIT is composed like this: if SPLIT-SPEC
is specified, this split is returned as-is (unless it is nil: in this
case, the group is ignored).  Otherwise, if TO-ADDRESS, TO-LIST and/or
EXTRA-ALIASES are specified, a regexp that matches any of them is
constructed (extra-aliases may be a list).  Additionally, if
SPLIT-REGEXP is specified, the regexp will be extended so that it
matches this regexp too, and if SPLIT-EXCLUDE is specified, RESTRICT
clauses will be generated.</p>
<p>
If CATCH-ALL is nil, no catch-all handling is performed, regardless of
catch-all marks in group parameters.  Otherwise, if there is no
selected group whose SPLIT-REGEXP matches the empty string, nor is
there a selected group whose SPLIT-SPEC is 'catch-all, this fancy
split (say, a group name) will be appended to the returned SPLIT list,
as the last element of a '| SPLIT.</p>
<p>
For example, given the following group parameters:</p>
<p>
nnml:mail.bar:
((to-address . "bar@femail.com")
 (split-regexp . ".*@femail\\.com"))
nnml:mail.foo:
((to-list . "foo@nowhere.gov")
 (extra-aliases "foo@localhost" "foo-redist@home")
 (split-exclude "bugs-foo" "rambling-foo")
 (admin-address . "foo-request@nowhere.gov"))
nnml:mail.others:
((split-spec . catch-all))</p>
<p>
Calling (gnus-group-split-fancy nil nil "mail.others") returns:</p>
<p>
(| (& (any "\\(bar@femail\\.com\\|.*@femail\\.com\\)"
	   "mail.bar")
      (any "\\(foo@nowhere\\.gov\\|foo@localhost\\|foo-redist@home\\)"
	   - "bugs-foo" - "rambling-foo" "mail.foo"))
   "mail.others")</p>
<p>
(fn &optional GROUPS NO-CROSSPOST CATCH-ALL)</p>
