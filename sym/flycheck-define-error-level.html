<h3>Function: flycheck-define-error-level</h3>
<p>
Define a new error LEVEL with PROPERTIES.</p>
<p>
The following PROPERTIES constitute an error level:</p>
<p>
`:severity SEVERITY'
     A number denoting the severity of this level.  The higher
     the number, the more severe is this level compared to other
     levels.  Defaults to 0.</p>
<p>
     The severity is used by `flycheck-error-level-<' to
     determine the ordering of errors according to their levels.</p>
<p>
`:compilation-level LEVEL'</p>
<p>
     A number indicating the broad class of messages that errors
     at this level belong to: one of 0 (info), 1 (warning), or
     2 or nil (error).  Defaults to nil.</p>
<p>
     This is used by `flycheck-checker-pattern-to-error-regexp'
     to map error levels into `compilation-mode''s hierarchy and
     to get proper highlighting of errors in `compilation-mode'.</p>
<p>
`:overlay-category CATEGORY'
     A symbol denoting the overlay category to use for error
     highlight overlays for this level.  See Info
     node `(elisp)Overlay Properties' for more information about
     overlay categories.</p>
<p>
     A category for an error level overlay should at least define
     the `face' property, for error highlighting.  Another useful
     property for error level categories is `priority', to
     influence the stacking of multiple error level overlays.</p>
<p>
`:fringe-bitmap BITMAP'
     A fringe bitmap symbol denoting the bitmap to use for fringe
     indicators for this level.  See Info node `(elisp)Fringe
     Bitmaps' for more information about fringe bitmaps,
     including a list of built-in fringe bitmaps.</p>
<p>
`:fringe-face FACE'
     A face symbol denoting the face to use for fringe indicators
     for this level.</p>
<p>
`:error-list-face FACE'
     A face symbol denoting the face to use for messages of this
     level in the error list.  See `flycheck-list-errors'.</p>
