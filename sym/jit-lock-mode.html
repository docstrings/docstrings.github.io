<h3>Function: jit-lock-mode</h3>
<p>
Toggle Just-in-time Lock mode.<br>
Turn Just-in-time Lock mode on if and only if ARG is non-nil.<br>
Enable it automatically by customizing group `font-lock'.<br>
<br>
When Just-in-time Lock mode is enabled, fontification is different in the<br>
following ways:<br>
<br>
- Demand-driven buffer fontification triggered by Emacs C code.<br>
  This means initial fontification of the whole buffer does not occur.<br>
  Instead, fontification occurs when necessary, such as when scrolling<br>
  through the buffer would otherwise reveal unfontified areas.  This is<br>
  useful if buffer fontification is too slow for large buffers.<br>
<br>
- Stealthy buffer fontification if `jit-lock-stealth-time' is non-nil.<br>
  This means remaining unfontified areas of buffers are fontified if Emacs has<br>
  been idle for `jit-lock-stealth-time' seconds, while Emacs remains idle.<br>
  This is useful if any buffer has any deferred fontification.<br>
<br>
- Deferred context fontification if `jit-lock-contextually' is<br>
  non-nil.  This means fontification updates the buffer corresponding to<br>
  true syntactic context, after `jit-lock-context-time' seconds of Emacs<br>
  idle time, while Emacs remains idle.  Otherwise, fontification occurs<br>
  on modified lines only, and subsequent lines can remain fontified<br>
  corresponding to previous syntactic contexts.  This is useful where<br>
  strings or comments span lines.<br>
<br>
Stealth fontification only occurs while the system remains unloaded.<br>
If the system load rises above `jit-lock-stealth-load' percent, stealth<br>
fontification is suspended.  Stealth fontification intensity is controlled via
the variable `jit-lock-stealth-nice'.</p>
<h3>Variable: jit-lock-mode</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means Just-in-time Lock mode is active.</p>
