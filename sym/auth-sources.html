<h3>Variable: auth-sources</h3>
<p>
List of authentication sources.<br>
<br>
The default will get login and password information from<br>
"~/.authinfo.gpg", which you should set up with the EPA/EPG<br>
packages to be encrypted.  If that file doesn't exist, it will<br>
try the unencrypted version "~/.authinfo" and the famous<br>
"~/.netrc" file.<br>
<br>
See the auth.info manual for details.<br>
<br>
Each entry is the authentication type with optional properties.<br>
<br>
It's best to customize this with `M-x customize-variable' because the choices
can get pretty complex.</p>
