<h3>Variable: auth-sources</h3>
<p>
List of authentication sources.</p>
<p>
The default will get login and password information from
"~/.authinfo.gpg", which you should set up with the EPA/EPG
packages to be encrypted.  If that file doesn't exist, it will
try the unencrypted version "~/.authinfo" and the famous
"~/.netrc" file.</p>
<p>
See the auth.info manual for details.</p>
<p>
Each entry is the authentication type with optional properties.</p>
<p>
It's best to customize this with `M-x customize-variable' because the choices
can get pretty complex.</p>
