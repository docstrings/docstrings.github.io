<h3>Function: prefer-coding-system</h3>
<p>
Add CODING-SYSTEM at the front of the priority list for automatic detection.
This also sets the following coding systems:
  o coding system of a newly created buffer
  o default coding system for subprocess I/O
This also sets the following values:
  o default value used as `file-name-coding-system' for converting file names
  o default value for the command `set-terminal-coding-system'
  o default value for the command `set-keyboard-coding-system'</p>
<p>
If CODING-SYSTEM specifies a certain type of EOL conversion, the coding
systems set by this function will use that type of EOL conversion.</p>
<p>
A coding system that requires automatic detection of text+encoding
(e.g. undecided, unix) can't be preferred.</p>
<p>
To prefer, for instance, utf-8, say the following:</p>
<p>
  (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)</p>
