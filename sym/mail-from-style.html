<h3>Variable: mail-from-style</h3>
<p>
Specifies how "From:" fields look.<br>
<br>
If `nil', they contain just the return address like:<br>
	king@grassland.com<br>
If `parens', they look like:<br>
	king@grassland.com (Elvis Parsley)<br>
If `angles', they look like:<br>
	Elvis Parsley <king@grassland.com><br>
<br>
Otherwise, most addresses look like `angles', but they look like<br>
`parens' if `angles' would need quoting and `parens' would not.</p>
