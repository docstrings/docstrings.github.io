<h3>Variable: mail-from-style</h3>
<p>
Specifies how "From:" fields look.</p>
<p>
If `nil', they contain just the return address like:
	king@grassland.com
If `parens', they look like:
	king@grassland.com (Elvis Parsley)
If `angles', they look like:
	Elvis Parsley <king@grassland.com></p>
<p>
Otherwise, most addresses look like `angles', but they look like
`parens' if `angles' would need quoting and `parens' would not.</p>
