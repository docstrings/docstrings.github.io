<h3>Function: dabbrev--select-buffers</h3>
<p>
Return a list of other buffers to search for a possible abbrev.
The current buffer is not included in the list.</p>
<p>
This function makes a list of all the buffers returned by `buffer-list',
then discards buffers whose names match `dabbrev-ignored-buffer-names'
or `dabbrev-ignored-buffer-regexps'.  It also discards buffers for which
`dabbrev-friend-buffer-function', if it is bound, returns nil when called
with the buffer as argument.
It returns the list of the buffers that are not discarded.</p>
