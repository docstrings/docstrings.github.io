<h3>Function: org-capture</h3>
<p>
Capture something.</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `org-capture-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
<p>
This will let you select a template from `org-capture-templates', and then
file the newly captured information.  The text is immediately inserted
at the target location, and an indirect buffer is shown where you can
edit it.  Pressing M-x org-capture-finalize brings you back to the previous state
of Emacs, so that you can continue your work.</p>
<p>
When called interactively with a C-u prefix argument GOTO, don't capture
anything, just go to the file/headline where the selected template
stores its notes.  With a double prefix argument C-u C-u, go to the last note
stored.</p>
<p>
When called with a `C-0' (zero) prefix, insert a template at point.</p>
<p>
Lisp programs can set KEYS to a string associated with a template
in `org-capture-templates'.  In this case, interactive selection
will be bypassed.</p>
<p>
If `org-capture-use-agenda-date' is non-nil, capturing from the
agenda will use the date at point as the default date.</p>
<p>
(fn &optional GOTO KEYS)</p>
