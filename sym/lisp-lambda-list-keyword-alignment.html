<h3>Variable: lisp-lambda-list-keyword-alignment</h3>
<p>
Whether to vertically align lambda-list keywords together.
If nil (the default), keyworded lambda-list parts are aligned
with the initial mandatory arguments, like this:</p>
<p>
(defun foo (arg1 arg2 &rest rest
            &key key1 key2)
  #|...|#)</p>
<p>
If non-nil, alignment is done with the first keyword
(or falls back to the previous case), as in:</p>
<p>
(defun foo (arg1 arg2 &rest rest
                      &key key1 key2)
  #|...|#)</p>
