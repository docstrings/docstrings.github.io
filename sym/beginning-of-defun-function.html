<h3>Variable: beginning-of-defun-function</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, function for `beginning-of-defun-raw' to call.<br>
This is used to find the beginning of the defun instead of using the<br>
normal recipe (see `beginning-of-defun').  Major modes can define this<br>
if defining `defun-prompt-regexp' is not sufficient to handle the mode's<br>
needs.<br>
<br>
The function takes the same argument as `beginning-of-defun' and should<br>
behave similarly, returning non-nil if it found the beginning of a defun.<br>
Ideally it should move to a point right before an open-paren which encloses
the body of the defun.</p>
