<h3>Variable: major-mode</h3>
<p>
Symbol for current buffer's major mode.<br>
The default value (normally `fundamental-mode') affects new buffers.<br>
A value of nil means to use the current buffer's major mode, provided<br>
it is not marked as "special".<br>
<br>
When a mode is used by default, `find-file' switches to it before it<br>
reads the contents into the buffer and before it finishes setting up<br>
the buffer.  Thus, the mode and its hooks should not expect certain<br>
variables such as `buffer-read-only' and `buffer-file-coding-system'
to be set up.</p>
