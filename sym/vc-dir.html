<h3>Function: vc-dir</h3>
<p>
Show the VC status for "interesting" files in and below DIR.<br>
This allows you to mark files and perform VC operations on them.<br>
The list omits files which are up to date, with no changes in your copy<br>
or the repository, if there is nothing in particular to say about them.<br>
<br>
Preparing the list of file status takes time; when the buffer<br>
first appears, it has only the first few lines of summary information.<br>
The file lines appear later.<br>
<br>
Optional second argument BACKEND specifies the VC backend to use.<br>
Interactively, a prefix argument means to ask for the backend.<br>
<br>
These are the commands available for use in the file status buffer:<br>
<br>
<br>
Uses keymap `vc-dir-mode-map', which is not currently defined.
