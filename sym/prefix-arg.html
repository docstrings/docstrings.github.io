<h3>Variable: prefix-arg</h3>
<p>
The value of the prefix argument for the next editing command.<br>
It may be a number, or the symbol `-' for just a minus sign as arg,<br>
or a list whose car is a number for just one or more C-u's<br>
or nil if no argument has been specified.<br>
<br>
You cannot examine this variable to find the argument for this command<br>
since it has been set to nil by the time you can look.<br>
Instead, you should use the variable `current-prefix-arg', although<br>
normally commands can get this prefix argument with (interactive "P").</p>
