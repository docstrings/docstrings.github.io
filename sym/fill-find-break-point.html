<h3>Function: fill-find-break-point</h3>
<p>
Move point to a proper line breaking position of the current line.
Don't move back past the buffer position LIMIT.</p>
<p>
This function is called when we are going to break the current line
after or before a non-ASCII character.  If the charset of the
character has the property `fill-find-break-point-function', this
function calls the property value as a function with one arg LIMIT.
If the charset has no such property, do nothing.</p>
