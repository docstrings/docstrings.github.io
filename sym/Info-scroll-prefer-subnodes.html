<h3>Variable: Info-scroll-prefer-subnodes</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, SPC in a menu visits subnodes.<br>
<br>
If this is non-nil, and you scroll far enough in a node that its menu<br>
appears on the screen, the next SPC<br>
moves to a subnode indicated by the following menu item.  This means<br>
that you visit a subnode before getting to the end of the menu.<br>
<br>
Setting this option to nil results in behavior similar to the stand-alone<br>
Info reader program, which visits the first subnode from the menu only<br>
when you hit the end of the current node.</p>
