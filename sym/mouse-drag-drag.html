<h3>Function: mouse-drag-drag</h3>
<p>
"Drag" the page according to a mouse drag.</p>
<p>
Drag scrolling moves the page according to the movement of the mouse.
You "grab" the character under the mouse and move it around.</p>
<p>
If the mouse is clicked and released in the same place of time we
assume that the user didn't want to scroll but wanted to whatever
mouse-2 used to do, so we pass it through.</p>
<p>
Drag scrolling is identical to the "hand" option in MacPaint, or the
middle button in Tk text widgets.</p>
<p>
To test this function, evaluate:
    (global-set-key [down-mouse-2] 'mouse-drag-drag)</p>
<p>
(fn START-EVENT)</p>
