<h3>Function: url-insert-entities-in-string</h3>
<p>
Convert HTML markup-start characters to entity references in STRING.
Also replaces the " character, so that the result may be safely used as
an attribute value in a tag.  Returns a new string with the result of the
conversion.  Replaces these characters as follows:
    &  ==>  &amp;
    <  ==>  &lt;
    >  ==>  &gt;
    "  ==>  &quot;</p>
