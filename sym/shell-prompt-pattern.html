<h3>Variable: shell-prompt-pattern</h3>
<p>
Regexp to match prompts in the inferior shell.<br>
Defaults to "^[^#$%>\n]*[#$%>] *", which works pretty well.<br>
This variable is used to initialize `comint-prompt-regexp' in the<br>
shell buffer.<br>
<br>
If `comint-use-prompt-regexp' is nil, then this variable is only used<br>
to determine paragraph boundaries.  See Info node `Shell Prompts' for<br>
how Shell mode treats paragraphs.<br>
<br>
The pattern should probably not match more than one line.  If it does,<br>
Shell mode may become confused trying to distinguish prompt from input<br>
on lines which don't start with a prompt.</p>
