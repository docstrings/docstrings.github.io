<h3>Variable: shell-prompt-pattern</h3>
<p>
Regexp to match prompts in the inferior shell.
Defaults to "^[^#$%>\n]*[#$%>] *", which works pretty well.
This variable is used to initialize `comint-prompt-regexp' in the
shell buffer.</p>
<p>
If `comint-use-prompt-regexp' is nil, then this variable is only used
to determine paragraph boundaries.  See Info node `Shell Prompts' for
how Shell mode treats paragraphs.</p>
<p>
The pattern should probably not match more than one line.  If it does,
Shell mode may become confused trying to distinguish prompt from input
on lines which don't start with a prompt.</p>
