<h3>Variable: smie-forward-token-function</h3>
<p>
Function to scan forward for the next token.<br>
Called with no argument should return a token and move to its end.<br>
If no token is found, return nil or the empty string.<br>
It can return nil when bumping into a parenthesis, which lets SMIE<br>
use syntax-tables to handle them in efficient C code.</p>
