<h3>Function: region-active-p</h3>
<p>
Return t if Transient Mark mode is enabled and the mark is active.<br>
<br>
Some commands act specially on the region when Transient Mark<br>
mode is enabled.  Usually, such commands should use<br>
`use-region-p' instead of this function, because `use-region-p'<br>
also checks the value of `use-empty-active-region'.</p>
