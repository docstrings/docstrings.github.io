<h3>Variable: double-click-fuzz</h3>
<p>
Maximum mouse movement between clicks to make a double-click.<br>
On window-system frames, value is the number of pixels the mouse may have<br>
moved horizontally or vertically between two clicks to make a double-click.<br>
On non window-system frames, value is interpreted in units of 1/8 characters<br>
instead of pixels.<br>

This variable is also the threshold for motion of the mouse
to count as a drag.</p>
