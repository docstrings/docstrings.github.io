<h3>Function: make-hash-table</h3>
<p>
Create and return a new hash table.</p>
<p>
Arguments are specified as keyword/argument pairs.  The following
arguments are defined:</p>
<p>
:test TEST -- TEST must be a symbol that specifies how to compare
keys.  Default is `eql'.  Predefined are the tests `eq', `eql', and
`equal'.  User-supplied test and hash functions can be specified via
`define-hash-table-test'.</p>
<p>
:size SIZE -- A hint as to how many elements will be put in the table.
Default is 65.</p>
<p>
:rehash-size REHASH-SIZE - Indicates how to expand the table when it
fills up.  If REHASH-SIZE is an integer, increase the size by that
amount.  If it is a float, it must be > 1.0, and the new size is the
old size multiplied by that factor.  Default is 1.5.</p>
<p>
:rehash-threshold THRESHOLD -- THRESHOLD must a float > 0, and <= 1.0.
Resize the hash table when the ratio (number of entries / table size)
is greater than or equal to THRESHOLD.  Default is 0.8.</p>
<p>
:weakness WEAK -- WEAK must be one of nil, t, `key', `value',
`key-or-value', or `key-and-value'.  If WEAK is not nil, the table
returned is a weak table.  Key/value pairs are removed from a weak
hash table when there are no non-weak references pointing to their
key, value, one of key or value, or both key and value, depending on
WEAK.  WEAK t is equivalent to `key-and-value'.  Default value of WEAK
is nil.</p>
