<h3>Function: buffer-menu</h3>
<p>
Switch to the Buffer Menu.
By default, the Buffer Menu lists all buffers except those whose
names start with a space (which are for internal use).  With
prefix argument ARG, show only buffers that are visiting files.</p>
<p>
In the Buffer Menu, the first column (denoted "C") shows "."
for the buffer from which you came, ">" for buffers you mark to
be displayed, and "D" for those you mark for deletion.</p>
<p>
The "R" column has a "%" if the buffer is read-only.
The "M" column has a "*" if it is modified, or "S" if you
have marked it for saving.</p>
<p>
The remaining columns show the buffer name, the buffer size in
characters, its major mode, and the visited file name (if any).</p>
<p>
See `Buffer-menu-mode' for the keybindings available the Buffer
Menu.</p>
