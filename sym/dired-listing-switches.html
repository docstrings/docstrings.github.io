<h3>Variable: dired-listing-switches</h3>
<p>
Switches passed to `ls' for Dired.  MUST contain the `l' option.
May contain all other options that don't contradict `-l';
may contain even `F', `b', `i' and `s'.  See also the variable
`dired-ls-F-marks-symlinks' concerning the `F' switch.
On systems such as MS-DOS and MS-Windows, which use `ls' emulation in Lisp,
some of the `ls' switches are not supported; see the doc string of
`insert-directory' in `ls-lisp.el' for more details.</p>
