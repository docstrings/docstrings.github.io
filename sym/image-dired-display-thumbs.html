<h3>Function: image-dired-display-thumbs</h3>
<p>
Display thumbnails of all marked files, in `image-dired-thumbnail-buffer'.
If a thumbnail image does not exist for a file, it is created on the
fly.  With prefix argument ARG, display only thumbnail for file at
point (this is useful if you have marked some files but want to show
another one).</p>
<p>
Recommended usage is to split the current frame horizontally so that
you have the dired buffer in the left window and the
`image-dired-thumbnail-buffer' buffer in the right window.</p>
<p>
With optional argument APPEND, append thumbnail to thumbnail buffer
instead of erasing it first.</p>
<p>
Optional argument DO-NOT-POP controls if `pop-to-buffer' should be
used or not.  If non-nil, use `display-buffer' instead of
`pop-to-buffer'.  This is used from functions like
`image-dired-next-line-and-display' and
`image-dired-previous-line-and-display' where we do not want the
thumbnail buffer to be selected.</p>
