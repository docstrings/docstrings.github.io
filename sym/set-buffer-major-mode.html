<h3>Function: set-buffer-major-mode</h3>
<p>
Set an appropriate major mode for BUFFER.<br>
For the *scratch* buffer, use `initial-major-mode', otherwise choose a mode<br>
according to the default value of `major-mode'.<br>
Use this function before selecting the buffer, since it may need to inspect<br>
the current buffer's major mode.
