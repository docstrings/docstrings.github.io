<h3>Function: set-buffer-major-mode</h3>
<p>
Set an appropriate major mode for BUFFER.
For the *scratch* buffer, use `initial-major-mode', otherwise choose a mode
according to the default value of `major-mode'.
Use this function before selecting the buffer, since it may need to inspect
the current buffer's major mode.</p>
