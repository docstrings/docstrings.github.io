<h3>Variable: yank-pop-change-selection</h3>
<p>
Whether rotating the kill ring changes the window system selection.<br>
If non-nil, whenever the kill ring is rotated (usually via the<br>
`yank-pop' command), Emacs also calls `interprogram-cut-function'<br>
to copy the new kill to the window system selection.</p>
