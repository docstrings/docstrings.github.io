<h3>Variable: completion-regexp-list</h3>
<p>
List of regexps that should restrict possible completions.
The basic completion functions only consider a completion acceptable
if it matches all regular expressions in this list, with
`case-fold-search' bound to the value of `completion-ignore-case'.
See Info node `(elisp)Basic Completion', for a description of these
functions.</p>
