<h3>Variable: overriding-terminal-local-map</h3>
<p>
Per-terminal keymap that overrides all other local keymaps.<br>
If this variable is non-nil, it is used as a keymap instead of the<br>
buffer's local map, and the minor mode keymaps and text property keymaps.<br>
It also replaces `overriding-local-map'.<br>
<br>
This variable is intended to let commands such as `universal-argument'<br>
set up a different keymap for reading the next command.<br>
<br>
`overriding-terminal-local-map' has a separate binding for each<br>
terminal device.<br>
See Info node `(elisp)Multiple Terminals'.</p>
