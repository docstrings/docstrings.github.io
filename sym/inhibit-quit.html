<h3>Variable: inhibit-quit</h3>
<p>
Non-nil inhibits C-g quitting from happening immediately.<br>
Note that `quit-flag' will still be set by typing C-g,<br>
so a quit will be signaled as soon as `inhibit-quit' is nil.<br>
To prevent this happening, set `quit-flag' to nil<br>
before making `inhibit-quit' nil.</p>
