<h3>Function: next-frame</h3>
<p>
Return the next frame in the frame list after FRAME.<br>
It considers only frames on the same terminal as FRAME.<br>
By default, skip minibuffer-only frames.<br>
If omitted, FRAME defaults to the selected frame.<br>
If optional argument MINIFRAME is nil, exclude minibuffer-only frames.<br>
If MINIFRAME is a window, include only its own frame<br>
and any frame now using that window as the minibuffer.<br>
If MINIFRAME is `visible', include all visible frames.<br>
If MINIFRAME is 0, include all visible and iconified frames.<br>
Otherwise, include all frames.
