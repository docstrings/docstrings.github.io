<h3>Function: vhdl-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for editing VHDL code.<br>
<br>
Usage:<br>
------<br>
<br>
  TEMPLATE INSERTION (electrification):<br>
    After typing a VHDL keyword and entering `SPC', you are prompted for<br>
    arguments while a template is generated for that VHDL construct.  Typing<br>
    `RET' or `C-g' at the first (mandatory) prompt aborts the current<br>
    template generation.  Optional arguments are indicated by square<br>
    brackets and removed if the queried string is left empty.  Prompts for<br>
    mandatory arguments remain in the code if the queried string is left<br>
    empty.  They can be queried again by `C-c C-t C-q'.  Enabled<br>
    electrification is indicated by `/e' in the mode line.<br>
<br>
      Typing `M-SPC' after a keyword inserts a space without calling the<br>
    template generator.  Automatic template generation (i.e.<br>
    electrification) can be disabled (enabled) by typing `C-c C-m C-e' or by<br>
    setting option `vhdl-electric-mode' (see OPTIONS).<br>
<br>
      Template generators can be invoked from the VHDL menu, by key<br>
    bindings, by typing `C-c C-i C-c' and choosing a construct, or by typing<br>
    the keyword (i.e. first word of menu entry not in parenthesis) and<br>
    `SPC'.  The following abbreviations can also be used: arch, attr, cond,<br>
    conf, comp, cons, func, inst, pack, sig, var.<br>
<br>
      Template styles can be customized in customization group<br>
    `vhdl-template' (see OPTIONS).<br>
<br>
<br>
  HEADER INSERTION:<br>
    A file header can be inserted by `C-c C-t C-h'.  A file footer<br>
    (template at the end of the file) can be inserted by `C-c C-t C-f'.<br>
    See customization group `vhdl-header'.<br>
<br>
<br>
  STUTTERING:<br>
    Double striking of some keys inserts cumbersome VHDL syntax elements.<br>
    Stuttering can be disabled (enabled) by typing `C-c C-m C-s' or by<br>
    option `vhdl-stutter-mode'.  Enabled stuttering is indicated by `/s' in<br>
    the mode line.  The stuttering keys and their effects are:<br>
<br>
      ;;   -->  " : "       [   -->  (        --    -->  comment<br>
      ;;;  -->  " := "      [[  -->  [        --CR  -->  comment-out code<br>
      ..   -->  " => "      ]   -->  )        ---   -->  horizontal line<br>
      ,,   -->  " <= "      ]]  -->  ]        ----  -->  display comment<br>
      ==   -->  " == "      ''  -->  \"<br>
<br>
<br>
  WORD COMPLETION:<br>
    Typing `TAB' after a (not completed) word looks for a VHDL keyword or a<br>
    word in the buffer that starts alike, inserts it and adjusts case.<br>
    Re-typing `TAB' toggles through alternative word completions.  This also<br>
    works in the minibuffer (i.e. in template generator prompts).<br>
<br>
      Typing `TAB' after `(' looks for and inserts complete parenthesized<br>
    expressions (e.g. for array index ranges).  All keywords as well as<br>
    standard types and subprograms of VHDL have predefined abbreviations<br>
    (e.g. type "std" and `TAB' will toggle through all standard types<br>
    beginning with "std").<br>
<br>
      Typing `TAB' after a non-word character indents the line if at the<br>
    beginning of a line (i.e. no preceding non-blank characters), and<br>
    inserts a tabulator stop otherwise.  `M-TAB' always inserts a tabulator<br>
    stop.<br>
<br>
<br>
  COMMENTS:<br>
        `--'       puts a single comment.<br>
        `---'      draws a horizontal line for separating code segments.<br>
        `----'     inserts a display comment, i.e. two horizontal lines<br>
                   with a comment in between.<br>
        `--CR'     comments out code on that line.  Re-hitting CR comments<br>
                   out following lines.<br>
        `C-c C-c'  comments out a region if not commented out,<br>
                   uncomments a region if already commented out.  Option<br>
                   `comment-style' defines where the comment characters<br>
                   should be placed (beginning of line, indent, etc.).<br>
<br>
      You are prompted for comments after object definitions (i.e. signals,<br>
    variables, constants, ports) and after subprogram and process<br>
    specifications if option `vhdl-prompt-for-comments' is non-nil.<br>
    Comments are automatically inserted as additional labels (e.g. after<br>
    begin statements) and as help comments if `vhdl-self-insert-comments' is<br>
    non-nil.<br>
<br>
      Inline comments (i.e. comments after a piece of code on the same line)<br>
    are indented at least to `vhdl-inline-comment-column'.  Comments go at<br>
    maximum to `vhdl-end-comment-column'.  `RET' after a space in a comment<br>
    will open a new comment line.  Typing beyond `vhdl-end-comment-column'<br>
    in a comment automatically opens a new comment line.  `M-q' re-fills<br>
    multi-line comments.<br>
<br>
<br>
  INDENTATION:<br>
    `TAB' indents a line if at the beginning of the line.  The amount of<br>
    indentation is specified by option `vhdl-basic-offset'.  `C-c C-i C-l'<br>
    always indents the current line (is bound to `TAB' if option<br>
    `vhdl-intelligent-tab' is nil).  If a region is active, `TAB' indents<br>
    the entire region.<br>
<br>
      Indentation can be done for a group of lines (`C-c C-i C-g'), a region<br>
    (`M-C-\') or the entire buffer (menu).  Argument and port lists are<br>
    indented normally (nil) or relative to the opening parenthesis (non-nil)<br>
    according to option `vhdl-argument-list-indent'.<br>
<br>
      If option `vhdl-indent-tabs-mode' is nil, spaces are used instead of<br>
    tabs.  `M-x tabify' and `M-x untabify' allow to convert spaces to tabs<br>
    and vice versa.<br>
<br>
      Syntax-based indentation can be very slow in large files.  Option<br>
    `vhdl-indent-syntax-based' allows to use faster but simpler indentation.<br>
<br>
      Option `vhdl-indent-comment-like-next-code-line' controls whether<br>
    comment lines are indented like the preceding or like the following code<br>
    line.<br>
<br>
<br>
  ALIGNMENT:<br>
    The alignment functions align operators, keywords, and inline comments<br>
    to beautify the code.  `C-c C-a C-a' aligns a group of consecutive lines<br>
    separated by blank lines, `C-c C-a C-i' a block of lines with same<br>
    indent.  `C-c C-a C-l' aligns all lines belonging to a list enclosed by<br>
    a pair of parentheses (e.g. port clause/map, argument list), and `C-c<br>
    C-a C-d' all lines within the declarative part of a design unit.  `C-c<br>
    C-a M-a' aligns an entire region.  `C-c C-a C-c' aligns inline comments<br>
    for a group of lines, and `C-c C-a M-c' for a region.<br>
<br>
      If option `vhdl-align-groups' is non-nil, groups of code lines<br>
    separated by special lines (see option `vhdl-align-group-separate') are<br>
    aligned individually.  If option `vhdl-align-same-indent' is non-nil,<br>
    blocks of lines with same indent are aligned separately.  Some templates<br>
    are automatically aligned after generation if option `vhdl-auto-align'<br>
    is non-nil.<br>
<br>
      Alignment tries to align inline comments at<br>
    `vhdl-inline-comment-column' and tries inline comment not to exceed<br>
    `vhdl-end-comment-column'.<br>
<br>
      `C-c C-x M-w' fixes up whitespace in a region.  That is, operator<br>
    symbols are surrounded by one space, and multiple spaces are eliminated.<br>
<br>
<br>
  CODE FILLING:<br>
    Code filling allows to condense code (e.g. sensitivity lists or port<br>
    maps) by removing comments and newlines and re-wrapping so that all<br>
    lines are maximally filled (block filling).  `C-c C-f C-f' fills a list<br>
    enclosed by parenthesis, `C-c C-f C-g' a group of lines separated by<br>
    blank lines, `C-c C-f C-i' a block of lines with same indent, and<br>
    `C-c C-f M-f' an entire region.<br>
<br>
<br>
  CODE BEAUTIFICATION:<br>
    `C-c M-b' and `C-c C-b' beautify the code of a region or of the entire<br>
    buffer respectively.  This includes indentation, alignment, and case<br>
    fixing.  Code beautification can also be run non-interactively using the<br>
    command:<br>
<br>
      emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs filename.vhd -f vhdl-beautify-buffer<br>
<br>
<br>
  PORT TRANSLATION:<br>
    Generic and port clauses from entity or component declarations can be<br>
    copied (`C-c C-p C-w') and pasted as entity and component declarations,<br>
    as component instantiations and corresponding internal constants and<br>
    signals, as a generic map with constants as actual generics, and as<br>
    internal signal initializations (menu).<br>
<br>
      To include formals in component instantiations, see option<br>
    `vhdl-association-list-with-formals'.  To include comments in pasting,<br>
    see options `vhdl-include-...-comments'.<br>
<br>
      A clause with several generic/port names on the same line can be<br>
    flattened (`C-c C-p C-f') so that only one name per line exists.  The<br>
    direction of ports can be reversed (`C-c C-p C-r'), i.e., inputs become<br>
    outputs and vice versa, which can be useful in testbenches.  (This<br>
    reversion is done on the internal data structure and is only reflected<br>
    in subsequent paste operations.)<br>
<br>
      Names for actual ports, instances, testbenches, and<br>
    design-under-test instances can be derived from existing names according<br>
    to options `vhdl-...-name'.  See customization group `vhdl-port'.<br>
<br>
<br>
  SUBPROGRAM TRANSLATION:<br>
    Similar functionality exists for copying/pasting the interface of<br>
    subprograms (function/procedure).  A subprogram interface can be copied<br>
    and then pasted as a subprogram declaration, body or call (uses<br>
    association list with formals).<br>
<br>
<br>
  TESTBENCH GENERATION:<br>
    A copied port can also be pasted as a testbench.  The generated<br>
    testbench includes an entity, an architecture, and an optional<br>
    configuration.  The architecture contains the component declaration and<br>
    instantiation of the DUT as well as internal constant and signal<br>
    declarations.  Additional user-defined templates can be inserted.  The<br>
    names used for entity/architecture/configuration/DUT as well as the file<br>
    structure to be generated can be customized. See customization group<br>
   `vhdl-testbench'.<br>
<br>
<br>
  KEY BINDINGS:<br>
    Key bindings (`C-c ...') exist for most commands (see in menu).<br>
<br>
<br>
  VHDL MENU:<br>
    All commands can be found in the VHDL menu including their key bindings.<br>
<br>
<br>
  FILE BROWSER:<br>
    The speedbar allows browsing of directories and file contents.  It can<br>
    be accessed from the VHDL menu and is automatically opened if option<br>
    `vhdl-speedbar-auto-open' is non-nil.<br>
<br>
      In speedbar, open files and directories with `mouse-2' on the name and<br>
    browse/rescan their contents with `mouse-2'/`S-mouse-2' on the `+'.<br>
<br>
<br>
  DESIGN HIERARCHY BROWSER:<br>
    The speedbar can also be used for browsing the hierarchy of design units<br>
    contained in the source files of the current directory or the specified<br>
    projects (see option `vhdl-project-alist').<br>
<br>
      The speedbar can be switched between file, directory hierarchy and<br>
    project hierarchy browsing mode in the speedbar menu or by typing `f',<br>
    `h' or `H' in speedbar.<br>
<br>
      In speedbar, open design units with `mouse-2' on the name and browse<br>
    their hierarchy with `mouse-2' on the `+'.  Ports can directly be copied<br>
    from entities and components (in packages).  Individual design units and<br>
    complete designs can directly be compiled ("Make" menu entry).<br>
<br>
      The hierarchy is automatically updated upon saving a modified source<br>
    file when option `vhdl-speedbar-update-on-saving' is non-nil.  The<br>
    hierarchy is only updated for projects that have been opened once in the<br>
    speedbar.  The hierarchy is cached between Emacs sessions in a file (see<br>
    options in group `vhdl-speedbar').<br>
<br>
      Simple design consistency checks are done during scanning, such as<br>
    multiple declarations of the same unit or missing primary units that are<br>
    required by secondary units.<br>
<br>
<br>
  STRUCTURAL COMPOSITION:<br>
    Enables simple structural composition.  `C-c C-m C-n' creates a skeleton<br>
    for a new component.  Subcomponents (i.e. component declaration and<br>
    instantiation) can be automatically placed from a previously read port<br>
    (`C-c C-m C-p') or directly from the hierarchy browser (`P').  Finally,<br>
    all subcomponents can be automatically connected using internal signals<br>
    and ports (`C-c C-m C-w') following these rules:<br>
      - subcomponent actual ports with same name are considered to be<br>
        connected by a signal (internal signal or port)<br>
      - signals that are only inputs to subcomponents are considered as<br>
        inputs to this component -> input port created<br>
      - signals that are only outputs from subcomponents are considered as<br>
        outputs from this component -> output port created<br>
      - signals that are inputs to AND outputs from subcomponents are<br>
        considered as internal connections -> internal signal created<br>
<br>
      Purpose:  With appropriate naming conventions it is possible to<br>
    create higher design levels with only a few mouse clicks or key<br>
    strokes.  A new design level can be created by simply generating a new<br>
    component, placing the required subcomponents from the hierarchy<br>
    browser, and wiring everything automatically.<br>
<br>
      Note: Automatic wiring only works reliably on templates of new<br>
    components and component instantiations that were created by VHDL mode.<br>
<br>
      Component declarations can be placed in a components package (option<br>
    `vhdl-use-components-package') which can be automatically generated for<br>
    an entire directory or project (`C-c C-m M-p').  The VHDL'93 direct<br>
    component instantiation is also supported (option<br>
    `vhdl-use-direct-instantiation').<br>
<br>
      Configuration declarations can automatically be generated either from<br>
    the menu (`C-c C-m C-f') (for the architecture the cursor is in) or from<br>
    the speedbar menu (for the architecture under the cursor).  The<br>
    configurations can optionally be hierarchical (i.e. include all<br>
    component levels of a hierarchical design, option<br>
    `vhdl-compose-configuration-hierarchical') or include subconfigurations<br>
    (option `vhdl-compose-configuration-use-subconfiguration').  For<br>
    subcomponents in hierarchical configurations, the most-recently-analyzed<br>
    (mra) architecture is selected.  If another architecture is desired, it<br>
    can be marked as most-recently-analyzed (speedbar menu) before<br>
    generating the configuration.<br>
<br>
      Note: Configurations of subcomponents (i.e. hierarchical configuration<br>
    declarations) are currently not considered when displaying<br>
    configurations in speedbar.<br>
<br>
      See the options group `vhdl-compose' for all relevant user options.<br>
<br>
<br>
  SOURCE FILE COMPILATION:<br>
    The syntax of the current buffer can be analyzed by calling a VHDL<br>
    compiler (menu, `C-c C-k').  The compiler to be used is specified by<br>
    option `vhdl-compiler'.  The available compilers are listed in option<br>
    `vhdl-compiler-alist' including all required compilation command,<br>
    command options, compilation directory, and error message syntax<br>
    information.  New compilers can be added.<br>
<br>
      All the source files of an entire design can be compiled by the `make'<br>
    command (menu, `C-c M-C-k') if an appropriate Makefile exists.<br>
<br>
<br>
  MAKEFILE GENERATION:<br>
    Makefiles can be generated automatically by an internal generation<br>
    routine (`C-c M-k').  The library unit dependency information is<br>
    obtained from the hierarchy browser.  Makefile generation can be<br>
    customized for each compiler in option `vhdl-compiler-alist'.<br>
<br>
      Makefile generation can also be run non-interactively using the<br>
    command:<br>
<br>
        emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -l vhdl-mode<br>
              [-compiler compilername] [-project projectname]<br>
              -f vhdl-generate-makefile<br>
<br>
      The Makefile's default target "all" compiles the entire design, the<br>
    target "clean" removes it and the target "library" creates the<br>
    library directory if not existent.  These target names can be customized<br>
    by option `vhdl-makefile-default-targets'.  The Makefile also includes a<br>
    target for each primary library unit which allows selective compilation<br>
    of this unit, its secondary units and its subhierarchy (example:<br>
    compilation of a design specified by a configuration).  User specific<br>
    parts can be inserted into a Makefile with option<br>
    `vhdl-makefile-generation-hook'.<br>
<br>
    Limitations:<br>
      - Only library units and dependencies within the current library are<br>
        considered.  Makefiles for designs that span multiple libraries are<br>
        not (yet) supported.<br>
      - Only one-level configurations are supported (also hierarchical),<br>
        but configurations that go down several levels are not.<br>
      - The "others" keyword in configurations is not supported.<br>
<br>
<br>
  PROJECTS:<br>
    Projects can be defined in option `vhdl-project-alist' and a current<br>
    project be selected using option `vhdl-project' (permanently) or from<br>
    the menu or speedbar (temporarily).  For each project, title and<br>
    description strings (for the file headers), source files/directories<br>
    (for the hierarchy browser and Makefile generation), library name, and<br>
    compiler-dependent options, exceptions and compilation directory can be<br>
    specified.  Compilation settings overwrite the settings of option<br>
    `vhdl-compiler-alist'.<br>
<br>
      Project setups can be exported (i.e. written to a file) and imported.<br>
    Imported setups are not automatically saved in `vhdl-project-alist' but<br>
    can be saved afterwards in its customization buffer.  When starting<br>
    Emacs with VHDL Mode (i.e. load a VHDL file or use "emacs -l<br>
    vhdl-mode") in a directory with an existing project setup file, it is<br>
    automatically loaded and its project activated if option<br>
    `vhdl-project-auto-load' is non-nil.  Names/paths of the project setup<br>
    files can be specified in option `vhdl-project-file-name'.  Multiple<br>
    project setups can be automatically loaded from global directories.<br>
    This is an alternative to specifying project setups with option<br>
    `vhdl-project-alist'.<br>
<br>
<br>
  SPECIAL MENUES:<br>
    As an alternative to the speedbar, an index menu can be added (set<br>
    option `vhdl-index-menu' to non-nil) or made accessible as a mouse menu<br>
    (e.g. add "(global-set-key '[S-down-mouse-3] 'imenu)" to your start-up<br>
    file) for browsing the file contents (is not populated if buffer is<br>
    larger than `font-lock-maximum-size').  Also, a source file menu can be<br>
    added (set option `vhdl-source-file-menu' to non-nil) for browsing the<br>
    current directory for VHDL source files.<br>
<br>
<br>
  VHDL STANDARDS:<br>
    The VHDL standards to be used are specified in option `vhdl-standard'.<br>
    Available standards are: VHDL'87/'93(02), VHDL-AMS, and Math Packages.<br>
<br>
<br>
  KEYWORD CASE:<br>
    Lower and upper case for keywords and standardized types, attributes,<br>
    and enumeration values is supported.  If the option<br>
    `vhdl-upper-case-keywords' is set to non-nil, keywords can be typed in<br>
    lower case and are converted into upper case automatically (not for<br>
    types, attributes, and enumeration values).  The case of keywords,<br>
    types, attributes,and enumeration values can be fixed for an entire<br>
    region (menu) or buffer (`C-c C-x C-c') according to the options<br>
    `vhdl-upper-case-{keywords,types,attributes,enum-values}'.<br>
<br>
<br>
  HIGHLIGHTING (fontification):<br>
    Keywords and standardized types, attributes, enumeration values, and<br>
    function names (controlled by option `vhdl-highlight-keywords'), as well<br>
    as comments, strings, and template prompts are highlighted using<br>
    different colors.  Unit, subprogram, signal, variable, constant,<br>
    parameter and generic/port names in declarations as well as labels are<br>
    highlighted if option `vhdl-highlight-names' is non-nil.<br>
<br>
      Additional reserved words or words with a forbidden syntax (e.g. words<br>
    that should be avoided) can be specified in option<br>
    `vhdl-forbidden-words' or `vhdl-forbidden-syntax' and be highlighted in<br>
    a warning color (option `vhdl-highlight-forbidden-words').  Verilog<br>
    keywords are highlighted as forbidden words if option<br>
    `vhdl-highlight-verilog-keywords' is non-nil.<br>
<br>
      Words with special syntax can be highlighted by specifying their<br>
    syntax and color in option `vhdl-special-syntax-alist' and by setting<br>
    option `vhdl-highlight-special-words' to non-nil.  This allows to<br>
    establish some naming conventions (e.g. to distinguish different kinds<br>
    of signals or other objects by using name suffices) and to support them<br>
    visually.<br>
<br>
      Option `vhdl-highlight-case-sensitive' can be set to non-nil in order<br>
    to support case-sensitive highlighting.  However, keywords are then only<br>
    highlighted if written in lower case.<br>
<br>
      Code between "translate_off" and "translate_on" pragmas is<br>
    highlighted using a different background color if option<br>
    `vhdl-highlight-translate-off' is non-nil.<br>
<br>
      For documentation and customization of the used colors see<br>
    customization group `vhdl-highlight-faces' (`M-x customize-group').  For<br>
    highlighting of matching parenthesis, see customization group<br>
    `paren-showing'.  Automatic buffer highlighting is turned on/off by<br>
    option `global-font-lock-mode' (`font-lock-auto-fontify' in XEmacs).<br>
<br>
<br>
  USER MODELS:<br>
    VHDL models (templates) can be specified by the user and made accessible<br>
    in the menu, through key bindings (`C-c C-m ...'), or by keyword<br>
    electrification.  See option `vhdl-model-alist'.<br>
<br>
<br>
  HIDE/SHOW:<br>
    The code of blocks, processes, subprograms, component declarations and<br>
    instantiations, generic/port clauses, and configuration declarations can<br>
    be hidden using the `Hide/Show' menu or by pressing `S-mouse-2' within<br>
    the code (see customization group `vhdl-menu').  XEmacs: limited<br>
    functionality due to old `hideshow.el' package.<br>
<br>
<br>
  CODE UPDATING:<br>
    - Sensitivity List: `C-c C-u C-s' updates the sensitivity list of the<br>
      current process, `C-c C-u M-s' of all processes in the current buffer.<br>
      Limitations:<br>
        - Only declared local signals (ports, signals declared in<br>
          architecture and blocks) are automatically inserted.<br>
        - Global signals declared in packages are not automatically inserted.<br>
          Insert them once manually (will be kept afterwards).<br>
        - Out parameters of procedures are considered to be read.<br>
      Use option `vhdl-entity-file-name' to specify the entity file name<br>
      (used to obtain the port names).<br>
      Use option `vhdl-array-index-record-field-in-sensitivity-list' to<br>
      specify whether to include array indices and record fields in<br>
      sensitivity lists.<br>
<br>
<br>
  CODE FIXING:<br>
    `C-c C-x C-p' fixes the closing parenthesis of a generic/port clause<br>
    (e.g. if the closing parenthesis is on the wrong line or is missing).<br>
<br>
<br>
  PRINTING:<br>
    PostScript printing with different faces (an optimized set of faces is<br>
    used if `vhdl-print-customize-faces' is non-nil) or colors (if<br>
    `ps-print-color-p' is non-nil) is possible using the standard Emacs<br>
    PostScript printing commands.  Option `vhdl-print-two-column' defines<br>
    appropriate default settings for nice landscape two-column printing.<br>
    The paper format can be set by option `ps-paper-type'.  Do not forget to<br>
    switch `ps-print-color-p' to nil for printing on black-and-white<br>
    printers.<br>
<br>
<br>
  OPTIONS:<br>
    User options allow customization of VHDL Mode.  All options are<br>
    accessible from the "Options" menu entry.  Simple options (switches<br>
    and choices) can directly be changed, while for complex options a<br>
    customization buffer is opened.  Changed options can be saved for future<br>
    sessions using the "Save Options" menu entry.<br>
<br>
      Options and their detailed descriptions can also be accessed by using<br>
    the "Customize" menu entry or the command `M-x customize-option' (`M-x<br>
    customize-group' for groups).  Some customizations only take effect<br>
    after some action (read the NOTE in the option documentation).<br>
    Customization can also be done globally (i.e. site-wide, read the<br>
    INSTALL file).<br>
<br>
      Not all options are described in this documentation, so go and see<br>
    what other useful user options there are (`M-x vhdl-customize' or menu)!


  FILE EXTENSIONS:
    As default, files with extensions ".vhd" and ".vhdl" are
    automatically recognized as VHDL source files.  To add an extension
    ".xxx", add the following line to your Emacs start-up file (`.emacs'):

      (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.xxx\\'" . vhdl-mode) auto-mode-alist))


  HINTS:
    - To start Emacs with open VHDL hierarchy browser without having to load
      a VHDL file first, use the command:

        emacs -l vhdl-mode -f speedbar-frame-mode

    - Type `C-g C-g' to interrupt long operations or if Emacs hangs.

    - Some features only work on properly indented code.
