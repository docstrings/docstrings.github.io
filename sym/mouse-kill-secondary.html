<h3>Function: mouse-kill-secondary</h3>
<p>
Kill the text in the secondary selection.<br>
This is intended more as a keyboard command than as a mouse command<br>
but it can work as either one.<br>
<br>
The current buffer (in case of keyboard use), or the buffer clicked on,<br>
must be the one that the secondary selection is in.  This requirement<br>
is to prevent accidents.
