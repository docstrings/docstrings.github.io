<h3>Function: mouse-kill-secondary</h3>
<p>
Kill the text in the secondary selection.
This is intended more as a keyboard command than as a mouse command
but it can work as either one.</p>
<p>
The current buffer (in case of keyboard use), or the buffer clicked on,
must be the one that the secondary selection is in.  This requirement
is to prevent accidents.</p>
