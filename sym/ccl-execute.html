<h3>Function: ccl-execute</h3>
<p>
Execute CCL-PROGRAM with registers initialized by REGISTERS.</p>
<p>
CCL-PROGRAM is a CCL program name (symbol)
or compiled code generated by `ccl-compile' (for backward compatibility.
In the latter case, the execution overhead is bigger than in the former).
No I/O commands should appear in CCL-PROGRAM.</p>
<p>
REGISTERS is a vector of [R0 R1 ... R7] where RN is an initial value
for the Nth register.</p>
<p>
As side effect, each element of REGISTERS holds the value of
the corresponding register after the execution.</p>
<p>
See the documentation of `define-ccl-program' for a definition of CCL
programs.</p>
