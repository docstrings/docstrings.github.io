<h3>Function: ad-add-advice</h3>
<p>
Add a piece of ADVICE to FUNCTION's list of advices in CLASS.</p>
<p>
ADVICE has the form (NAME PROTECTED ENABLED DEFINITION), where
NAME is the advice name; PROTECTED is a flag specifying whether
to protect against non-local exits; ENABLED is a flag specifying
whether to initially enable the advice; and DEFINITION has the
form (advice . LAMBDA), where LAMBDA is a lambda expression.</p>
<p>
If FUNCTION already has a piece of advice with the same name,
then POSITION is ignored, and the old advice is overwritten with
the new one.</p>
<p>
If FUNCTION already has one or more pieces of advice of the
specified CLASS, then POSITION determines where the new piece
goes.  POSITION can either be `first', `last' or a number (where
0 corresponds to `first', and numbers outside the valid range are
mapped to the closest extremal position).</p>
<p>
If FUNCTION was not advised already, its advice info will be
initialized.  Redefining a piece of advice whose name is part of
the cache-id will clear the cache.</p>
<p>
See Info node `(elisp)Computed Advice' for detailed documentation.</p>
