A new sparse keymap is stored as COMMAND's function definition and its value.<br>
If a second optional argument MAPVAR is given, the map is stored as<br>
its value instead of as COMMAND's value; but COMMAND is still defined<br>
as a function.<br>
The third optional argument NAME, if given, supplies a menu name<br>
string for the map.  This is required to use the keymap as a menu.<br>
This function returns COMMAND.<br>
