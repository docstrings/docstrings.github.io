<h3>Function: define-prefix-command</h3>
<p>
Define COMMAND as a prefix command.  COMMAND should be a symbol.
A new sparse keymap is stored as COMMAND's function definition and its value.
If a second optional argument MAPVAR is given, the map is stored as
its value instead of as COMMAND's value; but COMMAND is still defined
as a function.
The third optional argument NAME, if given, supplies a menu name
string for the map.  This is required to use the keymap as a menu.
This function returns COMMAND.</p>
<p>
(fn COMMAND &optional MAPVAR NAME)</p>
