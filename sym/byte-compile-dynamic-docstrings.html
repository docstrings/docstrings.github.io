<h3>Variable: byte-compile-dynamic-docstrings</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, compile doc strings for lazy access.
We bury the doc strings of functions and variables inside comments in
the file, and bring them into core only when they are actually needed.</p>
<p>
When this option is true, if you load the compiled file and then move it,
you won't be able to find the documentation of anything in that file.</p>
<p>
To disable this option for a certain file, make it a file-local variable
in the source file.  For example, add this to the first line:
  -*-byte-compile-dynamic-docstrings:nil;-*-
You can also set the variable globally.</p>
<p>
This option is enabled by default because it reduces Emacs memory usage.</p>
