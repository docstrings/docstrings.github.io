<h3>Function: describe-mode</h3>
<p>
Display documentation of current major mode and minor modes.
A brief summary of the minor modes comes first, followed by the
major mode description.  This is followed by detailed
descriptions of the minor modes, each on a separate page.</p>
<p>
For this to work correctly for a minor mode, the mode's indicator
variable (listed in `minor-mode-alist') must also be a function
whose documentation describes the minor mode.</p>
<p>
If called from Lisp with a non-nil BUFFER argument, display
documentation for the major and minor modes of that buffer.</p>
