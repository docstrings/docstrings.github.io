<h3>Function: describe-mode</h3>
<p>
Display documentation of current major mode and minor modes.<br>
A brief summary of the minor modes comes first, followed by the<br>
major mode description.  This is followed by detailed<br>
descriptions of the minor modes, each on a separate page.<br>
<br>
For this to work correctly for a minor mode, the mode's indicator<br>
variable (listed in `minor-mode-alist') must also be a function<br>
whose documentation describes the minor mode.<br>
<br>
If called from Lisp with a non-nil BUFFER argument, display<br>
documentation for the major and minor modes of that buffer.</p>
