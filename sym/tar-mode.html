<h3>Function: tar-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for viewing a tar file as a dired-like listing of its contents.<br>
You can move around using the usual cursor motion commands.<br>
Letters no longer insert themselves.<br>
Type `e' to pull a file out of the tar file and into its own buffer;<br>
or click mouse-2 on the file's line in the Tar mode buffer.<br>
Type `c' to copy an entry from the tar file into another file on disk.<br>
<br>
If you edit a sub-file of this archive (as with the `e' command) and<br>
save it with C-x C-s, the contents of that buffer will be<br>
saved back into the tar-file buffer; in this way you can edit a file<br>
inside of a tar archive without extracting it and re-archiving it.<br>
<br>
See also: variables `tar-update-datestamp' and `tar-anal-blocksize'.<br>
<br>
Uses keymap `tar-mode-map', which is not currently defined.
