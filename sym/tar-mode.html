<h3>Function: tar-mode</h3>
<p>
Major mode for viewing a tar file as a dired-like listing of its contents.
You can move around using the usual cursor motion commands.
Letters no longer insert themselves.
Type `e' to pull a file out of the tar file and into its own buffer;
or click mouse-2 on the file's line in the Tar mode buffer.
Type `c' to copy an entry from the tar file into another file on disk.</p>
<p>
If you edit a sub-file of this archive (as with the `e' command) and
save it with C-x C-s, the contents of that buffer will be
saved back into the tar-file buffer; in this way you can edit a file
inside of a tar archive without extracting it and re-archiving it.</p>
<p>
See also: variables `tar-update-datestamp' and `tar-anal-blocksize'.</p>
<p>
Uses keymap `tar-mode-map', which is not currently defined.</p>
