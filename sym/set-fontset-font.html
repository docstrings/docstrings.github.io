<h3>Function: set-fontset-font</h3>
<p>
Modify fontset NAME to use FONT-SPEC for TARGET characters.</p>
<p>
NAME is a fontset name string, nil for the fontset of FRAME, or t for
the default fontset.</p>
<p>
TARGET may be a cons; (FROM . TO), where FROM and TO are characters.
In that case, use FONT-SPEC for all characters in the range FROM and
TO (inclusive).</p>
<p>
TARGET may be a script name symbol.  In that case, use FONT-SPEC for
all characters that belong to the script.</p>
<p>
TARGET may be a charset.  In that case, use FONT-SPEC for all
characters in the charset.</p>
<p>
TARGET may be nil.  In that case, use FONT-SPEC for any characters for
that no FONT-SPEC is specified.</p>
<p>
FONT-SPEC may one of these:
 * A font-spec object made by the function `font-spec' (which see).
 * A cons (FAMILY . REGISTRY), where FAMILY is a font family name and
   REGISTRY is a font registry name.  FAMILY may contain foundry
   name, and REGISTRY may contain encoding name.
 * A font name string.
 * nil, which explicitly specifies that there's no font for TARGET.</p>
<p>
Optional 4th argument FRAME is a frame or nil for the selected frame
that is concerned in the case that NAME is nil.</p>
<p>
Optional 5th argument ADD, if non-nil, specifies how to add FONT-SPEC
to the font specifications for TARGET previously set.  If it is
`prepend', FONT-SPEC is prepended.  If it is `append', FONT-SPEC is
appended.  By default, FONT-SPEC overrides the previous settings.</p>
