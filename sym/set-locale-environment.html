<h3>Function: set-locale-environment</h3>
<p>
Set up multilingual environment for using LOCALE-NAME.
This sets the language environment, the coding system priority,
the default input method and sometimes other things.</p>
<p>
LOCALE-NAME should be a string which is the name of a locale supported
by the system.  Often it is of the form xx_XX.CODE, where xx is a
language, XX is a country, and CODE specifies a character set and
coding system.  For example, the locale name "ja_JP.EUC" might name
a locale for Japanese in Japan using the `japanese-iso-8bit'
coding-system.  The name may also have a modifier suffix, e.g. `@euro'
or `@cyrillic'.</p>
<p>
If LOCALE-NAME is nil, its value is taken from the environment
variables LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and LANG (the first one that is set).</p>
<p>
The locale names supported by your system can typically be found in a
directory named `/usr/share/locale' or `/usr/lib/locale'.  LOCALE-NAME
will be translated according to the table specified by
`locale-translation-file-name'.</p>
<p>
If FRAME is non-nil, only set the keyboard coding system and the
terminal coding system for the terminal of that frame, and don't
touch session-global parameters like the language environment.</p>
