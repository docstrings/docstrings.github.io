<h3>Function: count-words</h3>
<p>
Count words between START and END.
If called interactively, START and END are normally the start and
end of the buffer; but if the region is active, START and END are
the start and end of the region.  Print a message reporting the
number of lines, words, and chars.</p>
<p>
If called from Lisp, return the number of words between START and
END, without printing any message.</p>
