<h3>Function: occur-rename-buffer</h3>
<p>
Rename the current *Occur* buffer to *Occur: original-buffer-name*.<br>
Here `original-buffer-name' is the buffer name where Occur was originally run.<br>
When given the prefix argument, or called non-interactively, the renaming<br>
will not clobber the existing buffer(s) of that name, but use<br>
`generate-new-buffer-name' instead.  You can add this to `occur-hook'<br>
if you always want a separate *Occur* buffer for each buffer where you
invoke `occur'.</p>
