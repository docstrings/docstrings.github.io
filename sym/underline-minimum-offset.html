<h3>Variable: underline-minimum-offset</h3>
<p>
Minimum distance between baseline and underline.
This can improve legibility of underlined text at small font sizes,
particularly when using variable `x-use-underline-position-properties'
with fonts that specify an UNDERLINE_POSITION relatively close to the
baseline.  The default value is 1.</p>
