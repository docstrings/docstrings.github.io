<h3>Function: set-temporary-overlay-map</h3>
<p>
Set MAP as a temporary keymap taking precedence over most other keymaps.
Note that this does NOT take precedence over the "overriding" maps
`overriding-terminal-local-map' and `overriding-local-map' (or the
`keymap' text property).  Unlike those maps, if no match for a key is
found in MAP, the normal key lookup sequence then continues.</p>
<p>
Normally, MAP is used only once.  If the optional argument
KEEP-PRED is t, MAP stays active if a key from MAP is used.
KEEP-PRED can also be a function of no arguments: if it returns
non-nil then MAP stays active.</p>
