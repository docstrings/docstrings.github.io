<h3>Function: window-combination-limit</h3>
<p>
Return combination limit of window WINDOW.
If the return value is nil, child windows of WINDOW can be recombined
with WINDOW's siblings.  A return value of t means that child windows of
WINDOW are never (re-)combined with WINDOW's siblings.</p>
<p>
WINDOW must be a valid window.  The return value is meaningful for
internal windows only.</p>

<h3>Variable: window-combination-limit</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, splitting a window makes a new parent window.
The following values are recognized:</p>
<p>
nil means splitting a window will create a new parent window only if the
    window has no parent window or the window shall become part of a
    combination orthogonal to the one it is part of.</p>
<p>
`window-size' means that splitting a window for displaying a buffer
    makes a new parent window provided `display-buffer' is supposed to
    explicitly set the window's size due to the presence of a
    `window-height' or `window-width' entry in the alist used by
    `display-buffer'.  Otherwise, this value is handled like nil.</p>
<p>
`temp-buffer' means that splitting a window for displaying a temporary
    buffer always makes a new parent window.  Otherwise, this value is
    handled like nil.</p>
<p>
`display-buffer' means that splitting a window for displaying a buffer
    always makes a new parent window.  Since temporary buffers are
    displayed by the function `display-buffer', this value is stronger
    than `temp-buffer'.  Splitting a window for other purpose makes a
    new parent window only if needed.</p>
<p>
t means that splitting a window always creates a new parent window.  If
    all splits behave this way, each frame's window tree is a binary
    tree and every window but the frame's root window has exactly one
    sibling.</p>
<p>
Other values are reserved for future use.</p>
