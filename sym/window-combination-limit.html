<h3>Function: window-combination-limit</h3>
<p>
Return combination limit of window WINDOW.<br>
If the return value is nil, child windows of WINDOW can be recombined<br>
with WINDOW's siblings.  A return value of t means that child windows of<br>
WINDOW are never (re-)combined with WINDOW's siblings.<br>
<br>
WINDOW must be a valid window.  The return value is meaningful for<br>
internal windows only.

<h3>Variable: window-combination-limit</h3>
<p>
If non-nil, splitting a window makes a new parent window.<br>
The following values are recognized:<br>
<br>
nil means splitting a window will create a new parent window only if the<br>
    window has no parent window or the window shall become part of a<br>
    combination orthogonal to the one it is part of.<br>
<br>
`window-size' means that splitting a window for displaying a buffer<br>
    makes a new parent window provided `display-buffer' is supposed to<br>
    explicitly set the window's size due to the presence of a<br>
    `window-height' or `window-width' entry in the alist used by<br>
    `display-buffer'.  Otherwise, this value is handled like nil.<br>
<br>
`temp-buffer' means that splitting a window for displaying a temporary<br>
    buffer always makes a new parent window.  Otherwise, this value is<br>
    handled like nil.<br>
<br>
`display-buffer' means that splitting a window for displaying a buffer<br>
    always makes a new parent window.  Since temporary buffers are<br>
    displayed by the function `display-buffer', this value is stronger<br>
    than `temp-buffer'.  Splitting a window for other purpose makes a<br>
    new parent window only if needed.<br>
<br>
t means that splitting a window always creates a new parent window.  If<br>
    all splits behave this way, each frame's window tree is a binary<br>
    tree and every window but the frame's root window has exactly one
    sibling.

Other values are reserved for future use.</p>
