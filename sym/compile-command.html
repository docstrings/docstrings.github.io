<h3>Variable: compile-command</h3>
<p>
Last shell command used to do a compilation; default for next compilation.</p>
<p>
Sometimes it is useful for files to supply local values for this variable.
You might also use mode hooks to specify it in certain modes, like this:</p>
<p>
    (add-hook 'c-mode-hook
       (lambda ()
	 (unless (or (file-exists-p "makefile")
		     (file-exists-p "Makefile"))
	   (set (make-local-variable 'compile-command)
		(concat "make -k "
			(file-name-sans-extension buffer-file-name))))))</p>
