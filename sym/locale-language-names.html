<h3>Variable: locale-language-names</h3>
<p>
Alist of locale regexps vs the corresponding languages and coding systems.<br>
Each element has this form:<br>
  (LOCALE-REGEXP LANG-ENV CODING-SYSTEM)<br>
The first element whose LOCALE-REGEXP matches the start of a<br>
downcased locale specifies the LANG-ENV (language environment)<br>
and CODING-SYSTEM corresponding to that locale.  If there is no<br>
appropriate language environment, the element may have this form:<br>
  (LOCALE-REGEXP . LANG-ENV)<br>
In this case, LANG-ENV is one of generic language environments for an<br>
specific encoding such as "Latin-1" and "UTF-8".</p>
