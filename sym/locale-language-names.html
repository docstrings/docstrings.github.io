<h3>Variable: locale-language-names</h3>
<p>
Alist of locale regexps vs the corresponding languages and coding systems.
Each element has this form:
  (LOCALE-REGEXP LANG-ENV CODING-SYSTEM)
The first element whose LOCALE-REGEXP matches the start of a
downcased locale specifies the LANG-ENV (language environment)
and CODING-SYSTEM corresponding to that locale.  If there is no
appropriate language environment, the element may have this form:
  (LOCALE-REGEXP . LANG-ENV)
In this case, LANG-ENV is one of generic language environments for an
specific encoding such as "Latin-1" and "UTF-8".</p>
