<h3>Variable: max-lisp-eval-depth</h3>
<p>
Limit on depth in `eval', `apply' and `funcall' before error.<br>
<br>
This limit serves to catch infinite recursions for you before they cause<br>
actual stack overflow in C, which would be fatal for Emacs.<br>
You can safely make it considerably larger than its default value,<br>
if that proves inconveniently small.  However, if you increase it too far,<br>
Emacs could overflow the real C stack, and crash.</p>
