<h3>Function: isearch-occur</h3>
<p>
Run `occur' using the last search string as the regexp.
Interactively, REGEXP is constructed using the search string from the
last search command.  NLINES has the same meaning as in `occur'.</p>
<p>
If the last search command was a word search, REGEXP is computed from
the search words, ignoring punctuation.  If the last search
command was a regular expression search, REGEXP is the regular
expression used in that search.  If the last search command searched
for a literal string, REGEXP is constructed by quoting all the special
characters in that string.</p>
