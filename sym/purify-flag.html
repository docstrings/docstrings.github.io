<h3>Variable: purify-flag</h3>
<p>
Non-nil means loading Lisp code in order to dump an executable.
This means that certain objects should be allocated in shared (pure) space.
It can also be set to a hash-table, in which case this table is used to
do hash-consing of the objects allocated to pure space.</p>
