<h3>Function: profiler-cpu-log</h3>
<p>
Return the current cpu profiler log.<br>
The log is a hash-table mapping backtraces to counters which represent<br>
the amount of time spent at those points.  Every backtrace is a vector<br>
of functions, where the last few elements may be nil.<br>
Before returning, a new log is allocated for future samples.
