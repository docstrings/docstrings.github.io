<h3>Variable: multi-isearch-next-buffer-function</h3>
<p>
Function to call to get the next buffer to search.<br>
<br>
When this variable is set to a function that returns a buffer, then<br>
after typing another C-s or C-r at a failing search, the search goes<br>
to the next buffer in the series and continues searching for the<br>
next occurrence.<br>
<br>
This function should return the next buffer (it doesn't need to switch<br>
to it), or nil if it can't find the next buffer (when it reaches the<br>
end of the search space).<br>
<br>
The first argument of this function is the current buffer where the<br>
search is currently searching.  It defines the base buffer relative to<br>
which this function should find the next buffer.  When the isearch<br>
direction is backward (when `isearch-forward' is nil), this function<br>
should return the previous buffer to search.<br>
<br>
If the second argument of this function WRAP is non-nil, then it<br>
should return the first buffer in the series; and for the backward
search, it should return the last buffer in the series.</p>
