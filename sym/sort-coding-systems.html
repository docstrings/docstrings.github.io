<h3>Function: sort-coding-systems</h3>
<p>
Sort coding system list CODINGS by a priority of each coding system.
Return the sorted list.  CODINGS is modified by side effects.</p>
<p>
If a coding system is most preferred, it has the highest priority.
Otherwise, coding systems that correspond to MIME charsets have
higher priorities.  Among them, a coding system included in the
`coding-system' key of the current language environment has higher
priority.  See also the documentation of `language-info-alist'.</p>
<p>
If the variable `sort-coding-systems-predicate' (which see) is
non-nil, it is used to sort CODINGS instead.</p>
