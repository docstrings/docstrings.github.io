<h3>Function: shadow-define-regexp-group</h3>
<p>
Make each of a group of files be shared between hosts.<br>
Prompts for regular expression; files matching this are shared between a list<br>
of sites, which are also prompted for.  The filenames must be identical on all<br>
hosts (if they aren't, use `shadow-define-literal-group' instead of this<br>
function).  Each site can be either a hostname or the name of a cluster (see<br>
`shadow-define-cluster').
