<h3>Function: shadow-define-regexp-group</h3>
<p>
Make each of a group of files be shared between hosts.
Prompts for regular expression; files matching this are shared between a list
of sites, which are also prompted for.  The filenames must be identical on all
hosts (if they aren't, use `shadow-define-literal-group' instead of this
function).  Each site can be either a hostname or the name of a cluster (see
`shadow-define-cluster').</p>
